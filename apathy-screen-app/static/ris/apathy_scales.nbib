AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on intensive care unit (ICU) patients' symptom experiences 
      shortly after ICU discharge are scarce. OBJECTIVES: To determine prevalence, 
      frequency, severity and distress of symptoms, and to investigate if possible 
      predictive demographic and clinical factors are associated with a high number of 
      symptoms the first day after ICU discharge. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study 
      in Norway, thirty-two symptoms were evaluated in adult ICU survivors using the 
      Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Data on prevalence (yes/no), frequency and 
      severity (4-point scales) and distress (5-point scales) were collected. Possible 
      associations between selected predictive demographic and clinical factors and 
      having a high number (i.e.≥12) of symptoms were analysed using logistic 
      regression analyses. RESULTS: The patients (n=155) reported a median of 12 
      symptoms (range:0-22). Lack of energy and dry mouth were most prevalent (83%). 
      Lack of energy, dry mouth, and difficulty sleeping were most frequent (median=4). 
      Problems with sexual interest/activity (median=3.5), lack of energy, dry mouth, 
      difficulty sleeping, pain, vomiting, feeling sad and worrying were most severe 
      (median=3), and problems with sexual interest/activity (median=4), difficulty 
      sleeping, vomiting, feeling sad and worrying (median=3) were most distressing. 
      Patients admitted to surgical wards were more than twice as likely to report a 
      high number of symptoms (OR=2.23;95% CI [1.08,4.63]) than those admitted to 
      medical wards (p=0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Half of ICU survivors self-reported ≥12 
      symptoms the first day after ICU discharge. The most prevalent symptoms were not 
      the most distressful, highlighting the need to screen for multiple symptoms and 
      dimensions to provide target symptom relief and optimize rehabilitation.

AB  - The study aimed to: (i) translate and culturally adapt the DAS into Persian; (ii) 
      examine the psychometric properties of both the DAS-S and DAS-I; (iii) analyze 
      the three components of both the DAS-S and DAS-I to assess apathy dimensionally; 
      (iv) determine the optimal cut-off points using ROC analysis for the DAS-S, 
      DAS-I, and their subscales; and (v) identify predictors of initiation, emotional, 
      and executive apathy in stroke survivors. This study included 115 stroke 
      survivors and 38 healthy controls. Both DAS versions were evaluated for 
      acceptability, reliability, and validity. Exploratory factor analysis was 
      conducted to assess construct validity. Receiver Operating Characteristic curve 
      analysis was used to determine optimal cut-off points. Multiple regression 
      analyses were performed to identify predictors of apathy. Cronbach's alpha was 
      0.88 for DAS-S and 0.85 for DAS-I. ICC2,1 was > 0.93 for both versions. Total and 
      subscale scores of both DAS versions showed weak to moderate correlations with 
      the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Apathy subscale (r = 0.39-0.69). Principal 
      component analysis showed three components (executive, emotional, and initiation) 
      for DAS-S and DAS-I, explaining 49.26% and 53.02% of the variance, respectively. 
      The optimal cut-off was 31 for DAS-S (88.89% sensitivity, 86.36% specificity) and 
      29 for DAS-I (92.52% sensitivity, 86.36% specificity). Depression was the 
      strongest predictor of executive subscale scores of both DAS versions, as well as 
      the initiation subscale of the DAS-S, explaining 33.90-48.90% of the variance. 
      However, for the emotional subscale of both DAS versions, the strongest predictor 
      was the level of daily activity. The two versions of DAS effectively identify 
      apathy subtypes and are reliable and valid for assessing apathy in stroke 
      survivors. They effectively discriminate between apathetic and non-apathetic 
      stroke survivors. Depression is the strongest predictor of executive and 
      initiation apathy, whereas functional indicators-particularly independence in 
      activities of daily living-predict emotional apathy.

TI  - Recovery indicators from the perspective of patients with chronic low back pain: 
      a cross-sectional survey.
PG  - 835-843
LID - 10.1080/17581869.2025.2552631 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: In low back pain (LBP) research, recovery is commonly used as an outcome 
      measure. However, there is no method used to measure recovery or acceptable 
      definition for recovery. This research aims to investigate patients' perceptions 
      of recovery from LBP. MATERIALS & METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted 
      in which 350 patients with chronic LBP participated. Demographic and clinical 
      information was collected by a comprehensive and inclusive questionnaire. A 
      checklist of improvement indicators was given to the patients and completed by 
      them. It was aimed to identify the most important criteria for recovery in 
      patients with chronic LBP. RESULTS: The results showed that pain reduction alone 
      is not a reliable indicator of recovery. The patients' view about the recovery 
      from chronic LBP includes a wide range of factors in different areas of 
      symptomatic improvement, fear of recurrence injury, functional disability, 
      fatigue and reduced energy level. Also, a significant correlation was observed 
      between recovery indicators and pain duration, body mass index, and pain 
      intensity in patients with chronic LBP. CONCLUSIONS: The framework of recovery 
      for patients with chronic LBP is complicated and is a highly individual 
      structure. It is determined by the impact of symptoms on activities of daily 
      living factors.

OAB - Low back pain (LBP) is described as pain, muscle stiffness localized at the edges 
      of the lower ribs and above the gluteal. Even after 1 year, more than one-third 
      of patients have persistent symptoms. These findings suggest that either we lack 
      effective treatments or we are measuring inappropriate outcomes. This study 
      explores patients’ perceptions of recovery from LBP, about which little is known. 
      A checklist of improvement indicators was administered to patients with LBP to 
      identify the most important criteria for recovery. The results showed that pain 
      reduction alone is not the most important indicator of recovery. The patients’ 
      view about the recovery from LBP includes reducing the symptoms of disease, fear 
      of recurrence injury, disability, fatigue and reduced energy level. It is 
      determined by assessing the impact of different symptoms of LBP on daily 
      activities and social life, as well as quality of life.

TI  - Behavioral subtypes impact prognosis and survival in amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis: a clustering-based approach.
PG  - 729-738
LID - 10.1080/21678421.2025.2522402 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioral impairments are well established in amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS). A refined understanding of the contribution of delineated 
      patterns of behavioral impairments to prognosis is vitally important. METHODS: 
      Leveraging data-driven two-step cluster analysis, we first stratified a large 
      cross-sectional cohort of 170 ALS patients into distinct phenotypic subtypes 
      based on their baseline behavioral profiles, as determined by the well-validated 
      and informant-rated Motor Neuron Disease Behavioral Instrument (MiND-B). 
      Mixed-effects model and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to 
      compare rate of functional decline as measured by the revised ALS functional 
      rating scale (ALSFRS-R) over follow-up assessments in 121 participants, as well 
      as survival duration (n = 130), between the behavioral subtypes. Results: 
      Clustering analysis yielded three behavioral phenotypes characterized by 1) 
      intact behavioral functioning (n = 125), 2) apathy alone (n = 20), and 3) 
      concurrent disinhibition and stereotypical behavior (n = 25). Apathy was 
      associated with both significantly shorter survival (p = .003) and most rapid 
      functional decline across follow-up assessments (both p <.001). Importantly, this 
      pervasive effect was not observed in other behavioral cluster groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Extending previous cross-sectional work, current findings offer 
      delineation of the trajectory of clinical outcomes associated with classic 
      behavioral phenotypes of ALS. Converging with past evidence of unique disease and 
      progression profile in ALS patients with apathy, our work provides strong support 
      for behavioral change and in particular apathy as a reliable indicator of poor 
      prognosis across cross-sectional and longitudinal markers of clinical outcomes.

TI  - How demoralization is related to trait resilience factors: a network analysis in 
      a representative sample of the general population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Demoralization refers to a mental state of poor coping characterized 
      by a loss of purpose and meaning, feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, and 
      suicidal ideation. The revised demoralization scale (DS-II) is among the most 
      frequently used self-report measures. Recently, the psychometric properties and 
      normative values of the DS-II-Ms (Münster version of the DS-II) were published, 
      alongside a validation study linking it to depression and anxiety in the general 
      population. This study investigates the relationship between DS-II-Ms scores and 
      resilience, as well as well-validated trait resilience factors, specifically 
      locus of control and general self-efficacy, using a network psychometrics 
      approach. METHODS: DS-II-Ms, Patient Health Questionnaire 2 (PHQ-2), Generalized 
      Anxiety Disorder Scale 2 (GAD-2), Internal-External Locus of Control Short 
      Scale-4 (IE4), General Self-Efficacy Short Scale-3 (GSE-3) and Brief Resilience 
      Scale (BRS) were applied to a representative sample (N = 2401) of the German 
      general population. A gaussian graphical model was estimated using a 
      non-regularized algorithm to depict the unique connections between the measures. 
      RESULTS: DS-II-Ms was moderately associated with lower internal (and higher 
      external) locus of control while being conditionally independent from BRS and 
      GSE-3. Conversely, depression symptoms lack of interest/low mood were connected 
      to resilience and general self-efficacy but conditionally independent from locus 
      of control. CONCLUSIONS: Although the cross-sectional study design limits 
      directional interpretation, our findings indicate that trait resilience measures 
      have unique associations with demoralization and depression/anxiety symptoms, 
      supporting the discriminant validity of the demoralization construct. Depressed 
      and demoralized individuals might benefit from different therapeutical 
      approaches, targeting specific resilience factors.

TI  - Factors associated with improved curvature outcomes with collagenase clostridium 
      histolyticum for Peyronie's disease: results from a large prospective series.
PG  - 1799-1807
LID - 10.1093/jsxmed/qdaf213 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since its release in 2014, collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) 
      has become the most commonly used injectable therapy for Peyronie's disease (PD). 
      While some studies have suggested modest improvements in curvature with use of 
      CCH, others have found more significant gains. AIM: To determine predictors of 
      improved curvature in men with PD treated with CCH. METHODS: A prospective, 
      sequential database has been maintained of all men with PD undergoing CCH 
      injections since 2014. Clinical characteristics and responses to standardized and 
      nonstandardized questionnaires were collected at baseline, during, and after 
      treatment. OUTCOMES: Change in curvature was assessed using the "Most Recent" 
      curvature assessment, and statistical analyses were performed to identify factors 
      that correlated with greater curve improvements. RESULTS: A total of 826 men 
      underwent at least one CCH series and comprise the current cohort. Univariate 
      analysis demonstrated associations between greater curvature improvements in 
      patients with more severe baseline curvature (0.5° greater improvement per 
      increase in 1° baseline), hourglass deformities (3-10° greater improvement among 
      moderate/severe men), number of CCH series administered (0-4° per series), strong 
      nocturnal erections (11° higher), greater frequency of intercourse (0.6° per 
      intercourse attempt per month), greater bother and psychological impact (as 
      assessed by the Peyronie's Disease Questionnaire), and those who used RestoreX 
      (5-20° depending on test). Worse outcomes were observed among men who 
      self-reported decreased motivation (7°) as well as those with pure lateral 
      curvatures (11°). Men who experienced hematomas, a popping sensation, and those 
      with rapid detumescence during treatment also had more significant improvements 
      in curvature (5°). On multivariate analysis, baseline curvature, lateral curve 
      direction, hourglass/indentation deformities, RestoreX use, and suspected 
      controlled penile fracture remained independently associated with better 
      outcomes. Of all the factors assessed, RestoreX use was associated with the 
      largest degree of improvement. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: These findings highlight 
      several potential predictors of improved outcomes with CCH, which may be utilized 
      by providers to help counsel patients deciding on medical versus surgical 
      treatment of PD. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: The strengths include the largest 
      single-center prospective database of PD patients undergoing CCH published to 
      date and use of objective and validated instruments to track PD outcomes. 
      Limitations include the single-center nature, diverse patient cohort, and change 
      in CCH technique over time. CONCLUSION: Several baseline and treatment-related 
      factors correlate with CCH outcomes. These data may assist both patients and 
      providers as they relate to patient selection and counseling. The data also 
      suggest the importance of patient motivation and active participation during the 
      treatment course.

AB  - This study aimed to translate and validate the Russian version of the Adult 
      Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (A-RSQ). A total of 407 Russian-speaking 
      adults (53.3 % men; aged 18-74, M = 40.89, SD = 11.03) completed the A-RSQ and a 
      battery of psychological scales, including the Depression Anxiety Stress 
      Scales-21, Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation, Hikikomori Questionnaire-25, 
      Existential Isolation Scale, and Emotional Dysregulation Scale. For 
      factor-structure validation, the sample was randomly split into EFA (n = 213) and 
      CFA (n = 194). Exploratory factor analysis supported a two-factor model 
      (Rejection Concern and Rejection Expectancy), both subscales showing good 
      internal consistency (α ≥.83). Confirmatory factor analysis (WLSMV; 
      ordered-categorical items) showed acceptable incremental fit with elevated RMSEA 
      (CFI =.960, TLI =.954, RMSEA =.095, SRMR =.073) and a negative latent correlation 
      between factors (r = -.44). Test-retest reliability over a four-week interval was 
      acceptable (r = .79). Correlations with external constructs supported convergent 
      validity, revealing distinct associations between A-RSQ components and 
      depression, anxiety, social withdrawal, and interpersonal sensitivity. 
      Exploratory analyses by sex and age revealed that men scored higher on the total 
      A-RSQ and the Rejection Expectancy subscale, while Rejection Expectancy also 
      showed a small age-related decrease. These findings support the use of the 
      Russian A-RSQ as a psychometrically valid instrument for assessing rejection 
      sensitivity and its associations with emotional and interpersonal maladjustment.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Sleep disorders and Cognitive Disengagement Syndrome (CDS), a 
      persistent condition involving inappropriate cognitive and motor symptoms, can be 
      interconnected. Here, we aimed to evaluate the usefulness of self-reports of 
      adult CDS in sleep disorders population. METHODS: 242 participants (male = 110, 
      45.5 %; female = 132, 54.5 %) with sleep disorders were consecutively admitted to 
      Sleep Disorder Unit of San Raffaele Turro-Hospital of Milan, Italy. The 16-item 
      version, the 15-item version, and the 10 item versions of the Adult Concentration 
      Inventory (ACI) were administered. We used item response theory (IRT) analyses 
      based on nonparametric graded response model (NGRM) to evaluate the ACI 
      measurement properties. Internal consistency was assessed via Cronbach's alpha 
      coefficients. Associations between ACI scores and clinical variables were 
      examined using correlation and regression analyses. RESULTS: IRT analysis showed 
      that all ACI versions were provided with adequate measurement properties, 
      although in the case of the 10-item version of ACI marginal problems with local 
      independence were observed for two pairs of items. Adequate Cronbach's alpha 
      values were observed for the three ACI versions. All ACI version total scores 
      were significantly and non-negligibly associated with hypersomnia/narcolepsy. In 
      this sub-sample, all ACI scores showed significant and non-trivial relationships 
      with REM sleep latency, whereas only the 10-item ACI total score was 
      significantly related with the number of correct targets on the Clock Task. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that short versions of the ACI may be useful 
      for early detection of the attention difficulties in selected sleep disorders, 
      thus representing a potential help in everyday clinical practice.

AB  - This study aimed to validate the Italian version of the Multiscale Dissociation 
      Inventory (MDI-ITA) and to assess its psychometric properties in a non-clinical 
      sample. The MDI was translated and culturally adapted following established 
      guidelines. A total of 439 Italian-speaking adults participated in the study and 
      filled out the MDI-ITA and other assessment tools for dissociation depression, 
      anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic symptoms. The internal consistency, 
      test-retest reliability, and construct validity of the MDI-ITA were evaluated 
      using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Consistent with previous 
      validation studies, the analyses supported a five-factor structure: 
      Disengagement, Depersonalization/Derealization, Emotional Constriction, Memory 
      Disturbance, and Identity Dissociation. Cronbach's alpha values for each subscale 
      were all greater than 0.71, demonstrating satisfactory internal consistency. 
      Test-retest reliability was also high, with a correlation of 0.91. Convergent 
      validity was supported by significant positive correlations between MDI-ITA and 
      other dissociation measures. Discriminant validity was indicated by weaker 
      correlations with depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptoms. The MDI-ITA 
      is a reliable and valid tool for assessing dissociative phenomena in 
      Italian-speaking populations with potential applications in both clinical and 
      research settings. Its multidimensional structure offers comprehensive insights 
      into dissociation, facilitating the development of targeted interventions for 
      individuals presenting with these symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) occurs in absence of dementia, but 
      no studies explored whether MBI may limit the individuals' ability to complete 
      everyday tasks necessary to live independently. In this study we elucidated on 
      the relevance of specific behavioral markers on functional decline in both 
      cognitively normal (CN) older adults and with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 
      and evaluated whether individuals with MBI present worse cognition and 
      neurodegenerative dysfunctions compared to subjects without MBI. DESIGN: 
      Observational cross-sectional study. SETTING: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
      Initiative (ADNI) database. PARTICIPANTS: Amnesic MCI (aMCI; n = 232) 
      participants and CN (n = 418) individuals. MEASUREMENTS: Neuropsychological 
      assessment, volumetric MR brain scan, Flortaucipir PET for in vivo assessment of 
      regional tau deposition, functional assessment questionnaire (FAQ), and 
      neuropsychiatric inventory. RESULTS: MBI occurred in 53.5% aMCI and 19.6% CN. In 
      aMCI, the most prevalent behaviors were affective dysregulation (34.4%), impulse 
      dyscontrol (30.6%), and decreased drive/motivation (15.9%), whereas affective 
      dysregulation (13.1%) and impulse dyscontrol (10.2%) were most prevalent in CN. 
      In aMCI, affective dysregulation, decreased drive, social inappropriateness and 
      abnormal perception MBI domains significantly predicted the FAQ score, whereas 
      only decreased drive/motivation MBI domain showed a predicted role on FAQ in CN. 
      No effects of MBI were detected on regional tau deposition or brain volumes in 
      aMCI. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the occurrence of MBI might predict 
      a high risk of dysfunction in daily life in both aMCI and CN. An early detection 
      of functional impairment may improve the success of disease-modifying 
      interventions.

TI  - Patient-Reported Experiences With Long-Term Lifestyle Self-Monitoring in Heart 
      Disease: Mixed Methods Study.
PG  - e76978
LID - 10.2196/76978 [doi]
LID - e76978
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lifestyle behaviors strongly predict cardiovascular morbidity and 
      mortality, emphasizing the need for strategies that support sustained lifestyle 
      changes in patients with cardiac disease. Digital health solutions, including 
      wearables, mobile apps, and chatbots, enable self-monitoring of lifestyle 
      behaviors but often face challenges with engagement and usability. While 
      self-monitoring systems can increase awareness and accountability, maintaining 
      user engagement remains crucial for their effectiveness in promoting behavior 
      change and long-term improvements. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated patient 
      experiences with a lifestyle monitoring system combining a web application, 
      health watch, and chatbot. We explored facilitators of and barriers to long-term 
      adherence and assessed the impact of self-monitoring on lifestyle awareness and 
      behavior change in patients with cardiac disease. METHODS: We conducted a mixed 
      methods study with patients who used an eHealth platform for self-monitoring 
      lifestyle behaviors during 1 year following an invasive cardiac procedure. This 
      study included 100 patients (mean age 61.6, SD 10.4 y; n=88, 88% male) comprising 
      both completers (n=57, 57%) and dropouts (n=43, 43%). Patients engaged in 
      quarterly phone interviews and questionnaires and completed an end-of-study 
      questionnaire. Completers participated in a structured evaluation interview; 
      dropouts provided a reason for discontinuation. Quantitative and qualitative data 
      analyses focused on usability, long-term adherence facilitators and barriers, 
      lifestyle awareness, and behavior change. RESULTS: Patients completed 157 
      quarterly questionnaires (n=145, 92.4% by completers and n=12, 7.6% by dropouts) 
      and 217 phone interviews (n=171, 78.8% with completers and n=46, 21.2% with 
      dropouts). In total, 77 patients (of whom n=54, 70% were completers and n=23, 30% 
      were dropouts) completed end-of-study questionnaires, and 98% (56/57) of 
      completers participated in the evaluation interviews. Completers reported higher 
      perceptions of the platform's usefulness, ease of use, and satisfaction (P<.001 
      in all cases) than dropouts. Dropout reasons linked to self-monitoring (34/43, 
      79%) included high self-report burden and dissatisfaction with the chatbot, poor 
      overall usability experience, health watch technical challenges causing 
      frustration, limited perceived usefulness, mental stress from self-monitoring, 
      and low motivation. Key facilitators of long-term engagement included routine 
      formation, structured reminders, and minimal effort associated with the wearable. 
      Barriers included repetitive chatbot questions (causing cognitive burden) and 
      technical issues with the health watch. Self-monitoring increased lifestyle 
      awareness among completers, particularly regarding physical activity (25/56, 45%) 
      and nutrition (29/56, 52%), with smaller effects for sleep quality (7/56, 13%) 
      and mental stress (1/56, 2%). It facilitated behavior change in physical activity 
      and nutrition (16/56, 29% each) and sleep quality (4/56, 7%) but not in mental 
      stress. Adaptive personalization, mobile accessibility, and real-time feedback 
      could improve adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Fostering routine formation while 
      minimizing patient burden through personalized, flexible, and adaptive features 
      is important for sustained patient engagement in eHealth monitoring systems. 
      Enhancing relevance and usability while reducing complexity and technical 
      barriers can optimize digital health tools and promote lasting behavior change.

LID - 10.1016/j.jagp.2025.09.002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop an objective method for assessing apathy by identifying 
      behavioral clusters based on gaze behavior during an emotionally salient virtual 
      reality (VR) task, and examine associations with apathy severity, cognition, and 
      physiological reactivity. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: 
      Memory clinic at a university-affiliated hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-five 
      older adults (mean age 74 ± 5.7 years) with varying cognitive and affective 
      profiles. MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed a naturalistic VR task presenting 
      personalized positive images (e.g., grandchildren), aversive scenes, and neutral 
      stimuli. Eye-tracking data were collected and clustered using unsupervised 
      K-means based on time to first fixation, total fixation duration, and fixation 
      variability. Apathy was assessed using the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS), 
      cognition via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and depression with the 
      Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Physiological reactivity (heart rate 
      variability measured as root mean square of successive differences [RMSSD], 
      galvanic skin response [GSR], respiration) was analyzed using linear 
      mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Two gaze-based subgroups were identified: 
      "Engagers" (n = 48) showed faster, more sustained, and less variable gaze 
      behavior; "Nonengagers" (n = 37) exhibited delayed and more variable gaze 
      responses. Nonengagers were older, had lower MoCA scores, and higher apathy 
      levels. RMSSD was lower overall in nonengagers but increased selectively in 
      response to positive stimuli (grandchildren images). No group differences emerged 
      in GSR or respiration. CONCLUSIONS: Unsupervised clustering of gaze behavior 
      revealed ecologically valid apathy subtypes, linked to cognition and selective 
      RMSSD reactivity. VR-based gaze metrics may offer a scalable, objective tool for 
      detecting motivational impairments in aging.

TI  - Cognitive and neuropsychiatric profiles distinguish atypical parkinsonian 
      syndromes.
PG  - 3239-3251
LID - 10.1093/brain/awaf132 [doi]
AB  - Atypical parkinsonian syndromes are distinguished from Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      by additional neurological signs and characteristic underlying neuropathology. 
      However, they can be diagnostically challenging, rapidly progressive and are 
      often diagnosed late in disease course. Their different demographic features and 
      prognoses are well studied, but the accompanying cognitive and psychiatric 
      features may also facilitate diagnosis. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and 
      corticobasal syndrome (CBS) may cause cognitive and behavioural manifestations 
      that overlap with frontotemporal dementia, including non-fluent aphasia, apathy 
      and impulsivity. Clinical diagnostic criteria have limited sensitivity, with 
      pathologically confirmed PSP often having presented an initial clinical syndrome 
      other than PSP-Richardson's syndrome. Here, we integrate cross-sectional 
      multicentre baseline data from the PROSPECT-M-UK and Oxford Discovery cohorts. 
      This allowed us to compare cognitive and psychiatric features across a total of 
      1138 people with PSP, CBS, multiple-system atrophy (MSA) and idiopathic PD. Data 
      from the different cohorts were harmonized and compared using multiple linear 
      regression. There were five key results: (i) different syndromes showed 
      distinctive cognitive profiles, using readily applicable 'bedside' screening 
      tools. Frontal executive dysfunction was most evident in PSP, visuospatial 
      deficits in CBS, with milder deficits in memory and executive function in MSA, as 
      compared with PD; (ii) the most prevalent neuropsychiatric features were 
      depression and anxiety in CBS, apathy in PSP, with sleep disturbances common in 
      PD. As expected, apathy correlated positively with impulsivity across all 
      disorders. Neuropsychiatric features were generally better at discriminating 
      between atypical parkinsonian syndromes than were the cognitive domains; (iii) 
      both cognitive function and motor severity declined with disease duration, and 
      motor function predicted cognition in PSP, CBS and PD but not in MSA, suggesting 
      that in MSA cognitive and motor dysfunction are decoupled; (iv) plasma 
      neurofilament light chain (NFL) levels, measured in a subset of patients, 
      correlated with cognitive deficits in PSP, but not motor deficits; (v) cognitive 
      deficits contributed to the impairment in activities of daily living after 
      controlling for motor severity, with every two points on the Montreal Cognitive 
      Assessment worsening the Schwab and England score by one point. In anticipation 
      of future neuroprotective therapies, we present a classifier to improve 
      diagnostic accuracy for atypical parkinsonian syndromes in vivo. Longitudinal 
      cohort studies with resources for neuropathological gold standard diagnosis 
      remain important to validate better diagnostic tools for people with PSP, CBD, 
      MSA and atypical parkinsonism.

TI  - Validation of the Hong Kong version of Abe's behavioural and psychological 
      symptoms of dementia score among care home residents with dementia.
PG  - 153-160
LID - 10.12809/eaap2525 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To translate and validate the Hong Kong version of Abe's behavioural 
      and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) score (HK-ABS) and examine its 
      psychometric properties among older adults with dementia in Hong Kong care homes, 
      and to examine correlations among BPSD items, patient and caregiver 
      characteristics, and caregiver distress. METHODS: The content validity of the 
      HK-ABS was assessed by a panel of three psychiatrists, one psychiatric nurse, one 
      occupational therapist, and one medical social worker. Concurrent and 
      discriminant validity of the HK-ABS were assessed using the Chinese or Hong Kong 
      version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home (CNPI-NH), the Disability 
      Assessment for Dementia, the Clinical Dementia Rating, and the Montreal Cognitive 
      Assessment. Test-retest reliability and inter-rater reliability were determined. 
      Exploratory factor analysis examined possible constructs by principal component 
      analysis with varimax rotation. Factor extraction was based on Kaiser's 
      eigenvalue criterion. Correlations between the HK-ABS and characteristics of 
      patients and staff caregivers were examined. RESULTS: In total, 109 pairs of 
      patients with major neurocognitive disorder and staff caregivers in care homes 
      were included in the analysis. The median time to complete the HK-ABS was 70 
      seconds. The median HK-ABS score was 4. Internal consistency of the HK-ABS was 
      good (Cronbach's alpha = 0.787); item-total correlations (excluding 'apathy and 
      indifference') ranged from 0.337 to 0.653. The test-retest reliability (r(s) = 
      0.981, p = 0.168) and inter-rater reliability (r(s) = 0.987, p = 0.414) of the 
      HK-ABS was excellent. For concurrent validity, the HK-ABS was highly correlated 
      with the CNPI-NH (r(s) = 0.857, p < 0.001). For discriminant validity, the HK-ABS 
      was not correlated with the Chinese or Hong Kong version of the Montreal 
      Cognitive Assessment (r(s) = 0.103), the Disability Assessment for Dementia (r(s) 
      = -0.039), or the Clinical Dementia Rating (r(s) = 0.067). In exploratory factor 
      analysis, all items achieved factor loadings of >0.4. Three factors explained 70% 
      of the variance. The HK-ABS was negatively correlated with work experience (r(s) 
      = -0.254, p = 0.008) and positively correlated with the length of hospital stay 
      in the previous year (r(s) = 0.193, p = 0.044) and the CNPI-NH occupational 
      disruptive score (r(s) = 0.759, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The HK-ABS is a valid and 
      reliable global assessment tool of BPSD for residential care settings and 
      clinical communication. It may be used to identify caregiver distress to allow 
      for early intervention.

TI  - Neural Representations of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease 
      Continuum Using Pathology-Based Functional Connectivity Analysis.
PG  - e70774
LID - 10.1002/brb3.70774 [doi]
LID - e70774
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in the Alzheimer's disease continuum 
      affect the quality of life for patients and caregivers. Therefore, elucidating 
      the mechanisms of NPS is needed to better understand NPS and enhance patient 
      care. Several studies have investigated them using neuroimaging; however, none 
      have considered the regional coexistence of amyloid-beta and tau pathologies and 
      its association with functional networks. In this study, we aim to identify the 
      neural correlates of NPS considering the molecular and functional levels of 
      neural representation. METHODS: This study included data from amyloid-positive 
      participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database with 
      positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging, NPS 
      scores, and demographic data within one year and categorized them into groups 
      with or without NPS factors. NPS were assessed using the neuropsychiatric 
      inventory (NPI) and grouped into affective, apathy, hyperactivity, or psychosis 
      factors. Amyloid-beta and tau accumulation measured by PET were compared between 
      groups per region. Differences in functional connectivity of NPS- or 
      NPS-type-specific pathologically altered regions were investigated using 
      seed-to-voxel analysis. Further, a generalized linear model was constructed using 
      the NPI score for each factor as the dependent variable, with functional 
      connectivity strength, tau, and amyloid-beta accumulation as predictors. RESULTS: 
      Significant differences were observed in amyloid-beta and tau accumulation and 
      functional connectivity between groups. The right middle temporal gyrus (rMTG) 
      was associated with the affective factor, and the right parahippocampal and right 
      fusiform gyri were associated with the apathy factor. Moreover, the generalized 
      linear model was able to predict affective factor severity mainly based on the 
      functional connectivity strength between the rMTG and the left supramarginal and 
      angular gyri. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the key regions specific to affective 
      and apathy factors based on the areas with coexistence of amyloid-beta and tau 
      pathologies and the accompanying altered functional connectivity.

      overlap with depression and fatigue, and explore its associations with 
      multimorbidity and objective markers of health. DESIGN: Sydney Memory and Ageing 
      Study, an Australian population-based cohort. SETTING: Community dwellings 
      between 2005-2007. PARTICIPANTS: 1,030 older adults, without dementia, aged 
      70-90. MEASUREMENTS: Apathy was classified using strict (=3) and standard (≥2) 
      cutoff scores on the self-report Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)-3A, and a 
      validated cutoff score (>0) on the informant-report Neuropsychiatric Inventory. 
      Depression was assessed with strict and standard cutoffs on the GDS-12D, and 
      fatigue with the Assessment of Quality of Life-6D. Multimorbidity (≥2 chronic 
      conditions; computed with and without cardiovascular conditions), physical 
      performance (walking speed, sit-to-stand, lateral stability, grip strength), 
      adiposity (BMI, waist circumference), blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose 
      were assessed. RESULTS: Prevalence of apathy on the self-reported measure was 
      15.8 % (strict cutoff) or 48.9 % (standard). Informant-reported apathy was lower 
      (2.9 %). Prevalence of self-reported depression was 5.9 % (strict cutoff) or 
      15.8 % (standard), and fatigue 9.8 %. Apathy overlapped very little with 
      depression or fatigue (κ = .18, 95 % CI .14-.21). Apathy was associated with 
      multimorbidity (even when excluding cardiovascular conditions), adiposity, 
      fasting blood glucose level and physical performance, but not blood pressure or 
      cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: Apathy is more common than depression or fatigue in 
      dementia-free older adults. It does not typically co-occur with these symptoms, 
      but is accompanied by poorer physical health, including multimorbidity and 
      metabolic dysregulation. Apathy may be relevant for public health and an 
      important consideration in clinical care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnostic criteria for apathy in neurocognitive disorders (DCA-NCD) 
      have recently been updated. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether validated scales 
      measuring apathy severity capture the three dimensions of the DCA-NCD (diminished 
      initiative, diminished interest, diminished emotional expression). MEASUREMENTS: 
      Degree of mapping ("not at all", "weakly", or "strongly") between items on two 
      commonly used apathy scales, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician (NPI-C) 
      apathy and Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), with the DCA-NCD overall and its 3 
      dimensions was evaluated by survey. DESIGN: Survey participants, either experts 
      (n = 12, DCA-NCD authors) or scientific community members (n = 19), rated mapping 
      for each item and mean scores were calculated. Interrater reliability between 
      expert and scientific community members was assessed using Cohen's kappa. 
      RESULTS: According to experts, 9 of 11 (81.8%) NPI-C apathy items and 6 of 18 
      (33.3%) AES items mapped strongly onto the DCA-NCD overall. For the scientific 
      community group, 10 of 11 (90.9%) NPI-C apathy items and 7 of 18 (38.8%) AES 
      items mapped strongly onto the DCA-NCD overall. The overall mean mapping scores 
      were higher for the NPI-C apathy compared to the AES for both expert (t (11) 
      = 3.13, p = .01) and scientific community (t (17) = 3.77, p = .002) groups. There 
      was moderate agreement between the two groups on overall mapping for the NPI-C 
      apathy (kappa= 0.74 (0.57, 1.00)) and AES (kappa= 0.63 (0.35, 1.00)). 
      CONCLUSIONS: More NPI-C apathy than AES items mapped strongly and uniquely onto 
      the DCA-NCD and its dimensions. The NPI-C apathy may better capture the DCA-NCD 
      and its dimensions compared with the AES.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a debilitating symptom in patients with primary 
      mitochondrial disease nPMD). Developing new treatments that improve fatigue is a 
      patient priority but is hampered by a lack of fit-for-purpose patient-reported 
      outcome measures (PROMs). We aimed to understand the impact of fatigue on the 
      lives of people with PMD and develop a brief PMD-specific PROM to evaluate 
      fatigue in clinical trials. METHODS: Adults with genetically confirmed PMD and 
      self-reported moderate-to-severe fatigue and myopathy/exercise intolerance 
      participated in a concept elicitation interview to explore their experiences of 
      fatigue. Interview transcripts were coded thematically using MAXQDA™. 
      Characteristics and impacts that emerged from the interviews were mapped to items 
      in the PROMIS® Fatigue item bank. Participants then engaged in a cognitive 
      interview to assess relevance and understandability of PROMIS Fatigue items 
      considered for the PROM. RESULTS: Twelve adults with PMD (n = 8 women, age 
      20-75 years) were interviewed. The most frequently reported characteristics of 
      fatigue included tiredness, muscle weakness/fatigue, exhaustion, lack of energy, 
      and mental fatigue. Fatigue affected patients' ability to perform daily life 
      activities, including household chores, leisure activities, physical 
      activity/exercise, and work/school, and negatively affected mood and 
      relationships. Nine items were included in the final PROM based on level of 
      endorsement of underlying concepts elicited by the concept elicitation interviews 
      and relevance, clarity, and ease of answering, as assessed in the cognitive 
      interviews. CONCLUSION: The nine-item PROMIS Fatigue Mitochondrial Disease Short 
      Form is the first PROM designed specifically to assess fatigue in PMD. This study 
      demonstrates the content validity of the short form, and future longitudinal 
      studies will assess its psychometric properties.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To validate the Depression, Anxiety, and Apathy (DA3) scale for 
      assessing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and apathy in community-dwelling mid- 
      and late-life adults with and without cognitive impairment. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional psychometric validation study. SETTING: Community-based 
      longitudinal study of brain health. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 252 participants 
      (mean age, 68.8 ± 9.4 years; 68.5% women; 71.3% non-Hispanic White; 66.8% 
      cognitively normal) completed the study. MEASUREMENTS: The DA3 scale was compared 
      with established measures of mood including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
      Scale (HADS), Apathy Scale (AS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD7), Patient 
      Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ8), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire 
      (NPI-Q). Psychometric properties were assessed using reliability and validity 
      measures, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and Mokken scale analysis. RESULTS: 
      The DA3 demonstrated strong internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha, 0.670-0.781). 
      CFA supported a three-factor model corresponding to distinct depression, anxiety, 
      and apathy dimensions, with excellent goodness-of-fit. Mokken analysis confirmed 
      acceptable-to-strong scalability (H coefficients, 0.36-0.54). The DA3 subscales 
      demonstrated strong convergent validity with established measures (e.g., HADS, 
      AS, GAD-7, and PHQ-8). Cut-off scores of five on each subscale achieved optimal 
      agreement with gold standard measures. Performance of the DA3 was consistent 
      across sociodemographic, neuropsychological, and cognitive subgroups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The DA3 is a unitary, brief, valid, and reliable tool for assessing 
      depression, anxiety, and apathy in community-dwelling older adults, including 
      those with cognitive impairment. Its strong psychometric properties support its 
      use in both clinical and research settings. Future studies should examine its 
      longitudinal utility to better understand its role in tracking mood symptoms over 
      time.

      neuroanatomical correlates.

AB  - Behavioural changes are a central feature of frontotemporal dementia (FTD); they 
      occur in both behavioural-variant (bvFTD) and semantic dementia 
      (SD)/semantic-variant primary progressive aphasia subtypes. In this study, we 
      addressed two current clinical knowledge gaps: (i) are there qualitative or clear 
      distinctions between behavioural profiles in bvFTD and SD; and (ii) what are the 
      precise roles of the prefrontal cortex and anterior temporal lobes in supporting 
      social behaviour? Resolving these conundrums is crucial for improving diagnostic 
      accuracy and for the development of targeted interventions to treat challenging 
      behaviours in FTD. Informant questionnaires to assess behavioural changes 
      included the Cambridge Behavioural Inventory-Revised and two targeted measures of 
      apathy and impulsivity. Participants completed a detailed neuropsychological 
      battery to permit investigation of the relationship between cognitive status 
      (including social-semantic knowledge, general semantic knowledge and executive 
      function) with behaviour change in FTD. To explore changes in regional grey 
      matter volume, a subset of patients had structural MRI. Diagnosis-based group 
      comparisons were supplemented by a transdiagnostic approach that encompassed the 
      spectrum of bvFTD, SD and 'mixed' or intermediate cases. Such an approach is 
      sensitive to the systematic graded variation in FTD and allows the 
      neurobiological underpinnings of behaviour change to be explored across an FTD 
      spectrum. We found a wide range of behavioural changes across FTD. Although 
      quantitatively more severe on average in bvFTD, as expected, the item-level 
      analyses found no evidence for qualitative differences in behavioural profiles or 
      'behavioural double dissociations' between bvFTD and SD. Comparisons of self and 
      informant ratings revealed strong discrepancies in the perspective of the 
      caregiver versus the patient. Logistic regression revealed that 
      neuropsychological measures had better discriminative accuracy for bvFTD versus 
      SD than caregiver-reported behavioural measures. A principal component analysis 
      of all informant questionnaire domains extracted three components, interpreted as 
      reflecting: (i) apathy; (ii) challenging behaviours; and (iii) activities of 
      daily living. More severe apathy in both FTD subtypes was associated with: (i) 
      increased levels of impaired executive function; and (ii) anterior cingulate 
      cortex atrophy. Questionnaire ratings of impaired behaviour were not correlated 
      with either anterior temporal lobe atrophy or degraded social-semantic knowledge. 
      Together, these findings highlight the presence of a wide range of behavioural 
      changes in both bvFTD and SD, which vary by degree rather than quality. We 
      recommend a transdiagnostic approach for future studies of the neuropsychological 
      and neuroanatomical underpinnings of behavioural deficits in FTD.

TI  - Noradrenaline for progressive supranuclear palsy syndromes (NORAPS): a 
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover Phase IIb clinical trial 
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral atomoxetine for treating cognitive and 
      behavioural changes in people with progressive supranuclear palsy syndromes in 
      the UK.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a devastating 
      neurodegenerative disease characterised by cognitive, behavioural and motor 
      problems. Motor symptoms are highly disabling, while cognitive and behavioural 
      changes have a major impact on carer burden, quality of life and prognosis. 
      Apathy and impulsivity are very common, often coexistent in PSP, and negatively 
      predict survival. In preclinical models and other diseases, apathy and 
      impulsivity are associated with noradrenergic deficits, which can be severe in 
      PSP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Noradrenaline for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy 
      Syndromes trial is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover 
      design, Phase IIb clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral 
      atomoxetine for the treatment of cognitive and behavioural changes in PSP. 
      Participants receive atomoxetine 40 mg (10 mg/mL oral solution) once daily or a 
      matched placebo solution, in random order, each for 8 weeks. An 'informant', who 
      knows the patient with PSP well, is co-recruited to complete some of the trial 
      outcome measures. Participants remain in the trial for 22 weeks after 
      randomisation. The primary objectives are to assess (1) safety and tolerability 
      and (2) efficacy versus placebo on challenging behaviours as reported in a 
      subscale of the Cambridge Behavioural Inventory. Secondary and exploratory 
      measures relate to cognition, the PSP Rating Scale, mood and potential baseline 
      predictors of individual response to atomoxetine computed from imaging, genetic 
      and cognitive measures at baseline. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial was 
      approved by the South Central-Oxford B Research Ethics Committee (REC) and the 
      Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (REC reference: 20/SC/0416). 
      Dissemination will include publication in peer-reviewed journals, presentations 
      at academic and public conferences and engagement with patients, the public, 
      policymakers and practitioners. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN99462035; DOI:

TI  - Measuring Subjective Vitality and Depletion in Older People from a 
      Self-Determination Theory Perspective: A Dual Country Study.
PG  - 1-21
LID - 10.1080/0361073X.2025.2530808 [doi]
AB  - As the global older population grows, research increasingly focuses on their 
      well-being and quality of life, aspects that are often impacted by a perceived 
      loss of energy and fatigue. To describe individuals' energy dynamics, 
      Self-Determination Theory (SDT) has recently proposed a dual-process model based 
      on two constructs: Subjective Vitality and Depletion. The present study aims to 
      validate the Subjective Vitality/Depletion Scale (SVDS), an instrument based on 
      this model. A sample of 726 older adults (over 65) from two countries, USA and 
      Italy (M(age) = 72.57, SD(age) = 6.49), completed the SVDS, the Big Five 
      Inventory 2 - Extra Short Form (BFI-2-XS), the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey 
      (SF-12), and the Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire 
      (GSLTPAQ). Confirmatory factor analyses of the SVDS support the SDT hypothesis 
      that Subjective Vitality and Depletion are two distinct, yet related constructs. 
      Full measurement invariance for the scale was achieved across gender and age 
      subgroups, while partial scalar invariance was established across different 
      countries, suggesting some specific influence of cultural factors. Correlations 
      with BFI-2-XS, SF-12, and GSLTPAQ support the SVDS validity. The study provided 
      evidence that the SVDS based on SDT is a valid and reliable instrument for 
      assessing Subjective Vitality and Depletion among older individuals.

AB  - Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) has a significant impact on the quality of 
      life and disease prognosis of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Accurate 
      assessment of psychotic symptoms in PD patients is critical for early detection 
      and intervention. This, in turn, improves clinical outcomes and quality of life. 
      This review evaluates both internationally validated and China-specific 
      assessment tools for PDP, including the Parkinson's Psychosis Questionnaire, 
      Geriatric Apathy Scale, and culturally adapted instruments. We analyze the 
      psychometric properties, cultural applicability, and clinical utility of these 
      tools in Chinese populations. Our findings provide evidence-based recommendations 
      for healthcare professionals to optimize tool selection, enhance diagnostic 
      accuracy, and guide targeted interventions in China's diverse clinical settings. 
      The review also identifies gaps in current assessment approaches and proposes 
      directions for future tool development and validation studies.

TI  - Ambulatory Oxygen for Pulmonary Fibrosis (OxyPuF): a randomised controlled trial 
      and acceptability study.
PG  - 1-33
LID - 10.3310/TWKS4194 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating condition of unknown 
      cause that results in progressive, irreversible scarring of the lung, manifesting 
      as breathlessness and dry cough. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is thought to be 
      responsible for as many as 1 in 100 deaths in the United Kingdom, killing 5300 
      people a year. Ambulatory oxygen therapy is commonly used in idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis to relieve exertional breathlessness, although evidence to support this 
      strategy is lacking. This pragmatic randomised controlled trial was planned to 
      test whether use of ambulatory oxygen therapy is beneficial in people with 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: We planned a randomised controlled trial 
      in 260 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who are breathless on exertion 
      and do not meet criteria for long-term oxygen therapy, randomising in a 1 : 1 
      ratio between ambulatory oxygen therapy and best supportive care. Primary outcome 
      was a quality-of-life questionnaire validated in pulmonary fibrosis, the King's 
      Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire, measured at 6 months. We 
      calculated our sample size based on the minimum clinically important difference 
      of four units and standard deviation equal to 8.85 in King's Brief Interstitial 
      Lung Disease questionnaire; assuming power of 90% and 5% two-sided significance 
      level, thus required 130 per arm, after accounting for 20% dropout. The trials 
      unit's web-based randomisation algorithm minimises on factors potentially 
      influencing response to ambulatory oxygen therapy, such as severity of idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis, desaturation to < 88% present on walking, current or recent 
      (within 6 months) pulmonary rehabilitation, and recruitment centre. Secondary 
      outcomes included symptoms, exercise capacity and cost-effectiveness. A process 
      evaluation included assessment of trial fidelity and acceptability of the 
      intervention with use of qualitative research methods and arts approaches with 
      patients and staff. Qualitative interviews were conducted with patients from the 
      Ambulatory Oxygen for Pulmonary Fibrosis trial and the idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis patient support group Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis, and stakeholders: 
      healthcare professionals and policy-makers. Interviews were audio-recorded, 
      transcribed clean verbatim. Photovoice methodology was conducted with patients. A 
      workshop prior to data collection informed and guided data collection and 
      analysis. Traditional qualitative analysis and arts-based coproduction analysis 
      approaches were used to produce a short film. An economic model was planned but 
      could not occur due to early termination. RESULTS: The trial was stopped 
      prematurely due to low recruitment. This was due to a combination of the impact 
      of COVID-19 on research infrastructure, financial issues for sites with the 
      payment structure for the trial and lack of equipoise which limited site 
      recruitment. Seven out of 25 eligible, interested patients were randomised after 
      pre-screening, implying a lack of interest among patients in the study. Baseline 
      characteristics indicated that patients were elderly (mean age 81) and 
      predominantly male. Qualitative work with 11 patients and 23 other stakeholders 
      concluded that ambulatory oxygen therapy is desirable, acceptable and widely 
      commissioned in the United Kingdom, such that further trials are not likely to be 
      feasible. CONCLUSION: Although we are not able to formally address our objectives 
      of assessing efficacy and cost-effectiveness of ambulatory oxygen therapy in 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, it is unlikely that conducting a randomised 
      controlled trial is feasible due to lack of equipoise. FUNDING: This synopsis 
      presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health and 
      Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme as award number 
      NIHR131149.

OAB - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is responsible for as many as 1 in 100 deaths in 
      the UK, killing 5300 people a year. Initially, sufferers notice shortness of 
      breath and a persistent dry cough. As a result of breathlessness, patients reduce 
      their physical activity; even basic tasks, such as washing, dressing and eating, 
      can become difficult. Treatment may include exercise programmes (pulmonary 
      rehabilitation), and tablets designed to reduce processes in the lung which lead 
      to scarring (antifibrotics). Increasing breathlessness can happen as a result of 
      low oxygen levels, especially when trying to be active; it can even occur when 
      oxygen levels are normal. There has been very little research into how to treat 
      low oxygen levels for those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; so far, there is 
      no evidence as to whether using oxygen just for walking (ambulatory oxygen 
      treatment) is helpful. This study planned to assess whether or not ambulatory 
      oxygen therapy helped people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. To test this, we 
      designed a randomised controlled trial for 260 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      patients who were breathless when walking. We had difficulty finding centres and 
      patients to participate; therefore, the trial stopped early, with only seven 
      participants. These difficulties were affected by the impact of COVID-19 on 
      conducting research across the country and unexpected financial issues relating 
      to how treatment was delivered from different centres. However, interviews with 
      people not participating in the study suggested the study would be unappealing to 
      patients and healthcare professionals regardless of other factors. Analysis of 
      data from 37 interviews (patients, clinicians and commissioners) concluded that 
      ambulatory oxygen therapy was acceptable and widely (perhaps universally) 
      available. Patients held strong views that it should be provided when required. 
      We conclude that further trials of ambulatory oxygen therapy in idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis are not appropriate and that research in future should focus 
      on improving support services and oxygen technologies.

TI  - Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and White Matter Hyperintensities in Older Cognitively 
      Unimpaired Men Versus Women.
PG  - e70107
LID - 10.1002/gps.70107 [doi]
LID - e70107
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine association patterns of white matter 
      hyperintensities (WMH) with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in men versus women. 
      METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data acquired from the 
      National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. Cognitively unimpaired 
      participants aged ≥ 50 years with data on WMH severity were studied. Using 
      Cardiovascular Health Study scores, WMH were coded as no to mild (score: 0-4), 
      moderate (score: 5-6) or extensive (score: 7-8). NPS were quantified on the 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. For the purposes of the main analysis, 
      participants were dichotomized for presence of each NPS (0: absent; 1: present). 
      Adjusted binary logistic regression models estimated the odds of having each of 
      12 NPS by sex-WMH status. To confirm the validity of our findings, the 
      correlations between NPS severity and WMH burden were also separately explored in 
      men and women. RESULTS: Among 4617 participants with normal cognition, there were 
      1502 men and 2685 women with no to mild WMH changes, 102 men and 274 women with 
      moderate WMH changes and 19 men and 35 women with extensive WMH changes. Greater 
      WMH burden (especially extensive changes) was related to increased odds of 
      lability symptoms (agitation, disinhibition, irritability) and apathy in men but 
      not women. Elation and appetite disorders followed the same trend but failed to 
      achieve statistical significance. The exploratory analysis revealed positive 
      correlations between these symptoms' severity with WMH burden in men but not in 
      women. CONCLUSIONS: WMH burden was differentially associated with NPS in older 
      men versus women with normal cognition.

TI  - A Short Cognitive and Neuropsychiatric Assessment Scale for Progressive 
      Supranuclear Palsy.
PG  - 764-774
LID - 10.1002/mdc3.14348 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) suffer from 
      several neuropsychological impairments. These mainly affect the frontal lobe and 
      subcortical brain structures. However, a scale for the assessment of cognitive 
      and neuropsychiatric disability in PSP is still missing. OBJECTIVES: To create 
      and validate a new scale for cognitive and neuropsychiatric impairment in PSP. 
      METHODS: The Short Cognitive and Neuropsychiatric (ShoCo) scale was developed 
      containing five items (bradyphrenia, apathy, aphasia, dysexecution and 
      disinhibition). Each item can be categorized into 0 = no deficit, 1 = mild 
      deficit, 2 = moderate deficit and 3 = severe deficit. The total score includes 15 
      points, 0 meaning no deficit and 15 severe deficits. Cross-sectional and 
      longitudinal data from 201 baseline and 71 follow up patients were analyzed. 
      RESULTS: Baseline ShoCo scale results were 5.9 ± 2.9. No significant differences 
      between patients with Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS) and variants (vPSP) could be 
      detected in the PSP-ShoCo scale scores (PSP-RS 6.1 ± 3.0, n = 160, vPSP 
      5.1 ± 2.6, n = 41, P = 0.057). The scale showed good correlation with established 
      scores (eg, Montreal cognitive assessment r = -0.535, P = 0.001). The ShoCo scale 
      showed significant annualized change within the PSP-RS patients (baseline 
      6.2 ± 2.9, follow up 6.9 ± 3.1, annualized diff. 1.0 ± 3.1, n = 57, P = 0.022). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The ShoCo scale seems a promising and valid tool to measure specific 
      neuropsychological disabilities of PSP patients in clinical routine and research.

TI  - Exploring Virtual Reality-Based Reminiscence Therapy on Cognitive and Emotional 
      Well-Being in People with Cognitive Impairments: A Scoping Review.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci15050500 [doi]
LID - 500
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly being explored as a 
      non-pharmacological therapy to enhance the well-being of people with cognitive 
      impairment (PwCI). Studies suggest that VR-based interventions improve mood, 
      reduce apathy, and enhance emotional engagement, making VR a valuable tool for 
      cognitive and emotional support. This scoping review synthesizes evidence on 
      VR-based reminiscence therapy (VRRT) for PwCI. It aims to map existing knowledge, 
      highlight implementation challenges, and offer practical, technical design, and 
      evidence-informed recommendations for clinical integration-building on prior 
      reviews that have touched on these aspects, but placing a stronger and more 
      structured emphasis on real-world applicability and translational insights. This 
      review draws extensively on qualitative findings across the included studies to 
      better capture contextual factors, user experiences, facilitator roles, and 
      barriers to usability. Moreover, unlike previous research, we included only 
      studies involving individuals-either directly or via proxies-with an age-related 
      cognitive impairment, formally diagnosed by a qualified authority. METHODS: A 
      systematic search based on the PRISMA-ScR guideline identified 310 studies, of 
      which 11 met the inclusion criteria. These studies assessed the effectiveness and 
      feasibility of immersive VRRT. Research methodologies included longitudinal (n = 
      2), cross-sectional (n = 2), mixed-methods (n = 4), and randomized controlled 
      trials (n = 3)-with most studies focusing on feasibility-with a cumulative sample 
      size of approximately 287 participants. The quality of the included studies was 
      generally moderate; common limitations included small sample sizes, short 
      intervention periods, and limited control conditions. RESULTS: The findings 
      highlight VRRT's potential to enhance engagement, emotional well-being, and 
      cognitive function. However, usability challenges and technical limitations 
      persist. While VR offers promising benefits, further research is needed to refine 
      interventions, address personalization barriers, and assess long-term effects. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This review underscores the importance of integrating VRRT into care 
      programs and improving accessibility. Future research should enhance 
      methodological rigor to ensure reliable outcomes and maximize VR's impact on PwCI 
      well-being. The scoping review protocol is registered a priori with the Center 
      for Open Science (OSF) (registration type: OSF Preregistration, data registered:

TI  - Association of Depression Dimensions With Cognitive Functioning in 
      Community-Dwelling Oldest-Old Adults: The LifeAfter90 Study.
LID - 10.1093/geronb/gbaf012 [doi]
LID - gbaf012
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The oldest-old adults (90+) constitute the fastest-growing 
      demographic at the highest dementia risk among older adults. Depression, a common 
      risk factor, inherently presents with heterogeneous clinical manifestations. 
      Here, we explored the associations of the predominant depression dimensions with 
      cognition in the LifeAfter90 study. METHODS: The LifeAfter90 study consists of 
      racially/ethnically diverse community-dwelling adults of >90. Cognitive 
      assessments measured episodic memory, semantic memory, and executive function. 
      Baseline depression was measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 item 
      (GDS-15), yielding dimensions of Dysphoria, Withdrawal-Apathy-Vigor, Anxiety, 
      Hopelessness, and Subjective Memory Complaint (SMC). We used generalized linear 
      mixed models to explore associations between depression dimensions, and cognitive 
      outcomes at baseline and over time adjusting for demographic factors. RESULTS: 
      The cohort (n = 960, mean age 92.4 ± 2.3 years, 61.56% female) was very racially 
      and ethnically diverse with 27% of participants identifying as White, 24% as 
      Asian, 23% as Black, and 19% as Latino. Common complaints included not 
      identifying as "full of energy" (52.45%), preference to "stay home" (46.31%), and 
      "dropped activity" (40.0%), and 25% reported SMC. Depression dimensions showed 
      distinct associations with cognitive outcomes: SMC correlated with worse global 
      cognition, executive function, and verbal episodic memory (all ps < .0001). 
      Hopelessness was associated with worse executive function (p < .001). Over 1.2 
      years, baseline hopelessness showed a trend for a faster decline in episodic 
      memory (β = -0.22; p = .035). DISCUSSION: In the oldest old, specific dimensions 
      like SMC and hopelessness may help identify individuals at high risk for 
      cognitive decline in this highly vulnerable population.

TI  - Psychometric Evaluation of the Revised Suicide Crisis Inventory (SCI-2) in 
      Germany: Factor Structure, Reliability, and Validity in an Online and Outpatient 
      Sample.
PG  - e70106
LID - 10.1002/cpp.70106 [doi]
LID - e70106
AB  - BACKGROUND: The suicide crisis syndrome (SCS) is considered a cognitive and 
      affective state preceding a suicide attempt. Previous studies have demonstrated 
      its predictive validity and have shown it to be a uniform disorder entity in 
      various countries worldwide; however, research in Europe remains limited. The aim 
      of this study was therefore to contribute to a cross-cultural perspective on the 
      SCS and to examine its factor structure, reliability, and validity in Germany. 
      METHODS: Data of N = 1157 participants were collected between October 2022 and 
      December 2024 cross-sectionally from a German adult outpatient sample (n = 586; 
      65% female; age: M[SD] = 36.31[12.80], range: 18-68) and a German adult online 
      sample (n = 571; 74% female; age: M[SD] = 24.69[7.20], range: 18-67). 
      Participants completed the German version of the revised 61-item Suicide Crisis 
      Inventory (SCI-2-G) and other instruments (e.g., SIBS, BDI-II, and DASS) to 
      measure convergent and concurrent criterion validity. Statistical analyses 
      included confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) to confirm the proposed factors 
      (entrapment, affective disturbance, loss of cognitive control, hyperarousal, and 
      social withdrawal). RESULTS: The SCI-2-G total score demonstrated excellent 
      internal consistency, good convergent, and moderate concurrent criterion validity 
      in relation to stress, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and lifetime 
      suicide attempts. The CFA showed good model fit for the online sample and 
      adequate-to-good fit for the outpatient sample, with the five-factor model 
      consistently outperforming the one-factor model. CONCLUSION: CFA yielded 
      adequate-to-good model fit depending on the sample. Analyses indicate that the 
      SCI-2 is a valid measurement tool in Germany. The five-factor solution is 
      suggested to have higher clinical utility than a one-factor solution, as it 
      reflects the current formulation of the proposed SCS diagnosis. Future studies 
      should expand the cross-cultural perspective with longitudinal studies across 
      diverse clinical and nonclinical samples. SUMMARY: First validation of the German 
      revised version Suicide Crisis Inventory (SCI-2-G). Confirmatory factor analyses 
      support the five-factor solution of the scale. Good scale properties for an 
      online and outpatient sample in Germany.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Motivational disturbances, such as apathy and impulse control 
      disorders (ICDs), frequently co-occur in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
      The assessment of these motivational disturbances has proven to be challenging 
      due the absence of validated objective behavioral measures for evaluating 
      motivation in older adults. This scenario may contribute to underdiagnosis. The 
      present study aimed to investigate the clinical utility of a modified version of 
      an existing effort-based decision-making task which required cognitive (e.g., 
      working memory) instead of physical (e.g., finger tapping) effort. METHODS: 
      Ninety-five non-demented individuals (45-85 years of age) with idiopathic PD 
      completed a cognitive screening measure, self-report questionnaires, and a 
      cognitive adaptation of the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (COG-EEfRT), 
      which is a multi-trial game where a participant can choose whether to expend 
      greater effort for larger rewards which vary in magnitude and probability. 
      Patients were classified as having clinically significant symptoms of apathy 
      and/or an ICD based on recommended cut-off scores on the Apathy Scale (AS) and 
      Questionnaire for Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson's Disease - Rating Scale 
      (QUIP-RS). The methodological cutoffs defined two groups: Apathy (36.8 %), and 
      ICD (48.4 %). RESULTS: The level of effort expended by patients significantly 
      predicted apathy and ICD status with high accuracy (88.2 % and 82.4 %, 
      respectively), above and beyond age, levodopa equivalent dose and self-report 
      measures of motivation. Additionally, we found that greater symptoms of apathy 
      and ICD (i.e., negative urgency) were significantly correlated with patients 
      choosing to expend greater effort. This result varied based on reward probability 
      and outcome. CONCLUSION: We offer preliminary evidence suggesting the clinical 
      utility of the COG-EEfRT for identifying and quantifying motivational 
      disturbances in PD. Additionally, anticipatory anhedonia and impulsive traits may 
      be important predictors of cognitive effort-based decision-making. Compared to 
      tasks requiring physical effort, the COG-EEfRT may be a more suitable tool for PD 
      and perhaps for people with motor impairment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The questionnaire Apathy Evaluation Scale-Self (AES-S) has been 
      widely adopted globally, demonstrating high reliability and validity. However, 
      direct translation of the AES into Chinese does not fit well into the Chinese 
      cultural setting, so a structured and comprehensive revision is needed to obtain 
      a high reliability and validity version of the scale. METHODS: In this study, 436 
      adults aged ≥ 60 years from two communities in Beijing were assessed using a 
      modified AES-S. The methodology included item analysis, exploratory factor 
      analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis. The scale's validity was tested using 
      the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS) and Mini-Mental State 
      Examination (MMSE). Reliability assessment included retest reliability, internal 
      consistency reliability, and split-half reliability. RESULTS: The modified Apathy 
      Evaluation Scale-Self-Assessment (AES-S-C) presented a first-order four-factor 
      structure with higher reliability and validity than the original version within 
      the Chinese older adult community. CONCLUSIONS: The revised AES-S-C is more 
      suitable for the Chinese older adults in community settings. CLINICAL 
      IMPLICATIONS: This self-rated scale is suitable for screening apathy among older 
      adults in community or nursing facilities, aiding in the identification of 
      cognitive impairment and promoting mental health.

TI  - The Greek Version of the Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C): 
      Psychometric Properties in Mild Cognitive Impairment Due to Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci15050462 [doi]
LID - 462
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) is an early marker of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases, often preceding 
      cognitive decline. The MBI Checklist (MBI-C) is a 34-item tool designed to detect 
      MBI. This study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Greek version 
      of the MBI-C and its ability to differentiate patients with mild cognitive 
      impairment due to AD (MCI-AD) from cognitively unimpaired older adults (healthy 
      participants, HPs). METHODS: A total of 181 participants (104 MCI-AD, 77 HPs) 
      were recruited from the Third Age Day Care Center IASIS (2019-2023), accompanied 
      by a close informant. Participants underwent neuropsychological assessment 
      [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Addenbrooke's Cognitive 
      Examination-Revised (ACE-R)], and informants completed the MBI-C. Internal 
      consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's α and known-group validity was 
      assessed via comparing MBI-C between the MCI-AD and HPs groups. Diagnostic 
      accuracy was determined via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. 
      RESULTS: The Greek MBI-C showed excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 
      0.899). Among its domains, impulse dyscontrol demonstrated the highest 
      reliability (α = 0.901), whereas decreased motivation (α = 0.564) and abnormal 
      perception/thought content (α = 0.617) exhibited lower reliability. MBI-C total 
      and domain scores were significantly higher in patients with MCI-AD than HPs (p < 
      0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.871 (optimal cutoff = 9.5), 
      indicating excellent diagnostic performance. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the Greek 
      MBI-C has strong psychometric properties for MCI-AD. Sociocultural factors might 
      influence symptom identification and reporting, particularly in the domains of 
      decreased motivation and abnormal perception/thought content. Future research 
      should investigate its predictive value for dementia conversion and its 
      applicability to other populations, including individuals with subjective 
      cognitive decline and non-AD causes of MCI.

AB  - BackgroundNeuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are frequent in Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) dementia, but a higher NPS burden is found in dementia with Lewy bodies 
      (DLB). Lewy body (LB) pathology frequently co-occurs with AD pathology and may 
      not meet neuropathological criteria for DLB (ADLB). NPS trajectories over disease 
      course in these subgroups is not well understood.ObjectiveWe investigated changes 
      in NPS severity over time, at two time points, comparing clinicopathologically 
      defined cohorts of AD (without LB), ADLB, DLB, and controls.MethodsCases with two 
      available Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPIQ), at the time of 
      enrollment and within 2.5 years of death, were selected from the Arizona Study of 
      Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders. Differences and rate of change in NPIQ 
      scores were compared between AD (n = 75), ADLB (n = 48) DLB (n = 65), and 
      controls (n = 32) with covariates for age, sex, and cognition.ResultsFirst NPIQ 
      scores were highest in ADLB when compared to AD (p = 0.04) and controls 
      (p = 0.01) but not different from DLB. A significant increase in NPS severity was 
      observed in DLB and AD (p < 0.001) over a mean follow up time of 4.9 ± 3.0 years, 
      and the rate of change was significantly greater in DLB when compared to other 
      groups. Final NPIQ scores were highest in DLB when compared to AD (p = 0.03) but 
      not ADLB, and in DLB, ADLB, and AD than controls (all p < 0.001).ConclusionsEarly 
      NPS burden as well as NPS severity progression rate, independently of cognitive 
      status, might be useful clinical metrics and may help predict underlying 
      pathological diagnoses.

AB  - This study investigates whether older adults diagnosed with the apathy, gait 
      impairment, and executive dysfunction (AGED) triad, frequently associated with 
      cerebrovascular disease and confounded with depression, have earlier dementia 
      onset. We followed 322 community-dwelling older individuals (mean age 
      72.0 ± 6.4 years; 58.3% women) free of dementia at baseline for up to 9 years. 
      The AGED triad was identified when gait slowness (< 1 m/s), apathy (assessed by 
      Geriatric Depression Scale-3A with ≥ 2 items), and executive dysfunction 
      (assessed by the 75th percentile of Trail Making Test-part B by age range) were 
      simultaneously present. Incident dementia was diagnosed using the clinical 
      dementia rating scale. Over the 9-year follow-up (mean 45.1 ± 28.6 months), 44 
      participants (13.6%) converted to dementia. Sixteen participants (5.0%) were 
      diagnosed with AGED triad + and showed a significantly higher risk of earlier 
      conversion to dementia compared with AGED triad- (hazard ratio = 5.08, 95%CI 
      2.16-11.97; p = 0.0001), as well as to those with only one AGED factor or fewer 
      AGED factors. Hypertension and diabetes were 2 and 3 times more prevalent, 
      respectively, in individuals with AGED triad + . These findings suggest that the 
      AGED triad serves as a simplified and effective behavioral marker for accelerated 
      progression to dementia.

TI  - Building Consensus on the Relevant Criteria to Screen for Depressive Symptoms 
      Among Near-Centenarians and Centenarians: Modified e-Delphi Study.
PG  - e64352
LID - 10.2196/64352 [doi]
LID - e64352
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of centenarians worldwide is expected to increase 
      dramatically, reaching 3.4 million by 2050 and >25 million by 2100. Despite these 
      projections, depression remains a prevalent yet underdiagnosed and undertreated 
      condition among this population that carries significant health risks. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study aimed to identify and achieve consensus on the most representative 
      signs and symptoms of depression in near-centenarians and centenarians (aged ≥95 
      years) through an e-Delphi study with an international and interdisciplinary 
      panel of experts. Ultimately, the outcomes of this study might help create a 
      screening instrument that is specifically designed for this unique population. 
      METHODS: A modified e-Delphi study was carried out to achieve expert consensus on 
      depressive symptoms in near-centenarians and centenarians. A panel of 28 
      international experts was recruited. Consensus was defined as 70% agreement on 
      the relevance of each item. Data were collected through a web-based questionnaire 
      over 3 rounds. Experts rated 104 items that were divided into 24 dimensions and 
      80 criteria to identify the most representative signs and symptoms of depression 
      in this age group. RESULTS: The panel consisted of experts from various 
      countries, including physicians with experience in old age psychiatry or 
      geriatrics as well as nurses and psychologists. The response rate remained 
      consistent over the rounds (20/28, 71% to 21/28, 75%). In total, 4 new dimensions 
      and 8 new criteria were proposed by the experts, and consensus was reached on 86% 
      (24/28) of the dimensions and 80% (70/88) of the criteria. The most consensual 
      potentially relevant dimensions were lack of hope (21/21, 100%), loss of interest 
      (27/28, 96%), lack of reactivity to pleasant events (27/28, 96%), depressed mood 
      (26/28, 93%), and previous episodes of depression or diagnosed depression (19/21, 
      90%). In addition, the most consensual potentially relevant criteria were 
      despondency, gloom, and despair (25/25, 100%); depressed (27/27, 100%); lack of 
      reactivity to pleasant events or circumstances (28/28, 100%); suicidal ideation 
      (28/28, 100%); suicide attempt(s) (28/28, 100%); ruminations (27/28, 96%); 
      recurrent thoughts of death or suicide (27/28, 96%); feelings of worthlessness 
      (25/26, 96%); critical life events (20/21, 95%); anhedonia (20/21, 95%); loss of 
      interest in activities (26/28, 93%); loss of pleasure in activities (26/28, 93%); 
      and sadness (24/26, 92%). Moreover, when assessing depression in very old age, 
      the duration, number, frequency, and severity of signs and symptoms should also 
      be considered, as evidenced by the high expert agreement. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      classification of most elements as relevant highlights the importance of a 
      multidimensional approach for optimal depression screening among individuals of 
      very old age. This study offers a first step toward improving depression 
      assessment in near-centenarians and centenarians. The development of a more 
      adapted screening tool could improve early detection and intervention, enhancing 
      the quality of mental health care for this population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the psychometric properties of the Apathy 
      Evaluation Scale (AES) in chronic stroke survivors. METHODS: In this study, 112 
      non-cognitive impairment stroke survivors participated. Acceptability, 
      inter-rater, and test-retest reliability of the three Persian versions of AES 
      (clinician, informant, and self-rated) were evaluated. The correlation of three 
      AES versions with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Modified 
      Rankin Scale (mRS), and Barthel Index (BI) was evaluated. To assess the 
      diagnostic accuracy of the three AES versions, stroke survivors were classified 
      as apathetic (n = 43) and non-apathetic (n = 69) groups using the 'diagnostic 
      criteria of apathy'. RESULTS: The floor and ceiling effect, skewness, and 
      kurtosis were within acceptable range for three AES versions. Internal 
      consistency (α = 0.88-0.91) and test-retest and inter-rater reliability (ICC(2,1) 
      >0.90) were acceptable for all AES versions. Standard Error of Measurement and 
      Minimal Detectable Change values for test-retest and/or inter-rater reliability 
      ranged 1.6-2.5 and 4.42-6.93 for three versions of AES, respectively. Significant 
      moderate to high correlation (r or ƿ = -0.34-0.69) was found between three AES 
      versions and HADS-D, HADS-A, BI, and mRS. The cut-off point > 34 
      (sensitivity = 87.5%, specificity = 72.22%, and AUC = 0.80) was derived for 
      discriminating apathetic from non-apathetic stroke survivors based on the AES- 
      self-rated total score. CONCLUSION: All three AES versions are reliable and valid 
      screening tools to evaluate and characterize apathy in stroke survivors. The 
      AES-self-rated had good discriminative validity for discriminating apathetic from 
      non-apathetic subjects in non-cognitive impairment stroke survivors.

TI  - Is the social withdrawal subscale a valid instrument to assess social withdrawal 
      among colorectal cancer survivors with permanent stomas? A validation study.
PG  - 202
LID - 10.1186/s12888-025-06641-6 [doi]
LID - 202
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although social withdrawal is common among colorectal cancer (CRC) 
      survivors with permanent stomas, it has been poorly addressed due to a lack of 
      valid assessment tools. The social withdrawal subscale (SWS) from the 
      Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale shows promise for assessing 
      social withdrawal. However, there was no available data on its validity for this 
      purpose. This study aimed to investigate the reliability and validity of the SWS 
      as a screening tool for identifying survivors at risk of social withdrawal. 
      METHODS: Two separate convenience samples of 127 and 245 CRC survivors with 
      permanent stomas were selected. Item analysis and exploratory factor analysis 
      (EFA) were conducted with the first sample of 127 survivors. Confirmatory factor 
      analysis (CFA), reliability analysis, and tests for convergent and discriminant 
      validity were performed with the second sample of 245 survivors. Additionally, 
      the screening cut-off score and accuracy of the SWS scores were determined using 
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The item-total 
      correlation coefficients of the SWS ranged from 0.530 to 0.787. The EFA 
      demonstrated a single-factor structure for the SWS. The CFA confirmed appropriate 
      construct validity (χ²/df = 103.115/52 = 1.983, goodness-of-fit index 
      (GFI) = 0.925, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.959, and root mean square error of 
      approximation (RMSEA) = 0.068). The test-retest reliability was 0.849. Pearson 
      correlation analysis showed significant and moderate to large relationships 
      between the SWS and the chosen criterion measures, supporting its good convergent 
      validity. ROC analysis identified SWS scores of ≥ 15 as the optimal screening 
      cut-off, with a sensitivity of 86.5%, specificity of 50.5%, and an area under the 
      curve (AUC) of 0.748 (95% CI: 0.673-0.823, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The SWS 
      demonstrates acceptable reliability and validity for measuring social withdrawal 
      among CRC survivors with permanent stomas. Future studies should further evaluate 
      its utility in clinical settings.

TI  - Development and Feasibility Study of HOPE Model for Prediction of Depression 
      Among Older Adults Using Wi-Fi-based Motion Sensor Data: Machine Learning Study.
PG  - e67715
LID - 10.2196/67715 [doi]
LID - e67715
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression, characterized by persistent sadness and loss of interest 
      in daily activities, greatly reduces quality of life. Early detection is vital 
      for effective treatment and intervention. While many studies use wearable devices 
      to classify depression based on physical activity, these often rely on intrusive 
      methods. Additionally, most depression classification studies involve large 
      participant groups and use single-stage classifiers without explainability. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility of classifying depression 
      using nonintrusive Wi-Fi-based motion sensor data using a novel machine learning 
      model on a limited number of participants. We also conduct an explainability 
      analysis to interpret the model's predictions and identify key features 
      associated with depression classification. METHODS: In this study, we recruited 
      adults aged 65 years and older through web-based and in-person methods, supported 
      by a McGill University health care facility directory. Participants provided 
      consent, and we collected 6 months of activity and sleep data via nonintrusive 
      Wi-Fi-based sensors, along with Edmonton Frailty Scale and Geriatric Depression 
      Scale data. For depression classification, we proposed a HOPE (Home-Based Older 
      Adults' Depression Prediction) machine learning model with feature selection, 
      dimensionality reduction, and classification stages, evaluating various model 
      combinations using accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and F(1)-score. Shapely 
      addictive explanations and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations were 
      used to explain the model's predictions. RESULTS: A total of 6 participants were 
      enrolled in this study; however, 2 participants withdrew later due to internet 
      connectivity issues. Among the 4 remaining participants, 3 participants were 
      classified as not having depression, while 1 participant was identified as having 
      depression. The most accurate classification model, which combined sequential 
      forward selection for feature selection, principal component analysis for 
      dimensionality reduction, and a decision tree for classification, achieved an 
      accuracy of 87.5%, sensitivity of 90%, and precision of 88.3%, effectively 
      distinguishing individuals with and those without depression. The explainability 
      analysis revealed that the most influential features in depression 
      classification, in order of importance, were "average sleep duration," "total 
      number of sleep interruptions," "percentage of nights with sleep interruptions," 
      "average duration of sleep interruptions," and "Edmonton Frailty Scale." 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this preliminary study demonstrate the feasibility 
      of using Wi-Fi-based motion sensors for depression classification and highlight 
      the effectiveness of our proposed HOPE machine learning model, even with a small 
      sample size. These results suggest the potential for further research with a 
      larger cohort for more comprehensive validation. Additionally, the nonintrusive 
      data collection method and model architecture proposed in this study offer 
      promising applications in remote health monitoring, particularly for older adults 
      who may face challenges in using wearable devices. Furthermore, the importance of 
      sleep patterns identified in our explainability analysis aligns with findings 
      from previous research, emphasizing the need for more in-depth studies on the 
      role of sleep in mental health, as suggested in the explainable machine learning 
      study.

AB  - BackgroundTheory of mind (ToM) is crucial for socioemotional interaction. ToM 
      deficits may explain behavioral changes in dementia, especially Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).ObjectiveThis study examined the 
      psychometrics of a new ToM test in healthy adults, identified ToM differences in 
      dementia syndromes, and assessed if ToM scores predict neuropsychiatric function 
      and real-life behavior.MethodsThe UCSF Cognitive and Emotional Perspective Taking 
      Test (CEPT) was evaluated in 195 healthy adults (age: 42.69 ± 16.20) and in a 
      clinic cohort of 304 participants (age: 64.07 ± 9.2). Participants included 
      healthy controls, AD, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 
      semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), non-fluent PPA (nfvPPA), 
      and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients. CEPT's psychometrics were 
      assessed, and ToM differences and predictions of neuropsychiatric symptoms were 
      analyzed using regression models.ResultsIn controls, CEPT showed good validity 
      and reliability. In patients, CEPT scores correlated with executive and emotional 
      measures, but not language measures, showing good construct validity. Cognitive 
      ToM was most impaired in AD and bvFTD, with less impairment in svPPA and PSP, and 
      all patient groups showed impaired emotional ToM. ToM performance predicted 
      real-life neuropsychiatric behavior, including anxiety, apathy, disinhibition, 
      and aberrant motor behaviors.ConclusionsToM deficits appear early in dementia 
      syndromes and predict neuropsychiatric behavior. Assessing ToM and social 
      cognition with ecologically valid tasks may help identify altered social 
      cognition in early neurodegeneration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is one of the most limiting symptoms in individuals with 
      heart disease (HD). However, valid and reliable instruments for assessing fatigue 
      in clinical practice still need to be improved. OBJECTIVE: To assess the 
      dimensional structure of the self-reported Spanish Multidimensional Fatigue 
      Inventory (MFI) and analyze its psychometric properties in individuals with HD. 
      METHODS: A longitudinal observational study included 247 participants (age 57.71 
      years; 23.9 % women; 89.9 % Caucasian). Test-retest reliability was assessed 
      10-14 days after the first evaluation. Measures evaluating fatigue, 
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and functional capacity were collected to 
      assess convergent validity. Acceptability, practicality, construct validity, 
      floor/ceiling effects, internal consistency, and measurement error were also 
      calculated. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis supported the 4-factor 
      structure of the MFI and the deletion of 3 items for its application in 
      individuals with HD. The 17-item version showed no floor-ceiling effects and 
      exhibited excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.90) and test-retest 
      reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) = 0.94). While all 
      subscales demonstrated adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's α > 0.70) and 
      good to excellent test-retest reliability (ICC, 0.75 - 0.91), the reduced 
      motivation subscale showed slightly lower internal consistency. The minimal 
      detectable change was 9.5 points for the total score. Convergent validity was 
      established through moderate-strong correlations with fatigue, HRQoL, and 
      functional capacity measures (r = |0.320-0.729|). CONCLUSIONS: The shortened 
      version of the Spanish MFI (MFI-17) is a valid and reliable tool for quantifying 
      fatigue in individuals with HD, supporting its clinical and research 
      applicability.

AB  - Demoralization represents a clinical syndrome conceptualized as maladaptive 
      coping to a stressor associated with discouragement, feelings of hopelessness, 
      helplessness, and a loss of meaning in life. It is a prevalent comorbidity in 
      individuals with severe physical illnesses and affects a substantial proportion 
      of the general population when facing global stressors like the COVID-19 
      pandemic. The main aim of the study was to test whether demoralization and 
      features of depression and anxiety might reflect distinct entities within the 
      general population, specifically in older adults, and to explore symptom 
      interconnections, using a network psychometrics approach. The revised 
      demoralization scale (DS-II) and the patient health questionnaire 4 (PHQ-4) were 
      applied to a representative sample (N = 2434) from the German general population. 
      Network structures were analyzed using exploratory graph analysis (EGA) to 
      identify the most distinct symptom groupings and their relationships. Stability 
      of networks and symptom groupings was tested using bootstrap procedures. EGA 
      revealed unidimensionality within younger adulthood and a four-factor solution 
      within older adults, reliably distinguishing PHQ-4 and DS-II items. The most 
      central features of the network were worthlessness, pointlessness, helplessness, 
      feeling trapped and low mood. Suicidal ideation was more closely related to DS-II 
      worthlessness than to PHQ-4 items. The cross-sectional design and using PHQ-4 
      instead of more comprehensive measures of depression and anxiety were 
      limitations. In conclusion, in general population, demoralization symptoms can be 
      distinguished from lack of interest or pleasure and low mood. It might represent 
      a valid psychological construct beyond clinical populations. Further 
      investigation of diagnostic implications is encouraged.

TI  - Psychometric properties and clinical correlates of the Frontal Behaviour 
      Inventory in progressive supranuclear palsy: data from the PSP-NET.
PG  - 1207-1215
LID - 10.1007/s10072-024-07887-w [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as apathy, disinhibition and 
      irritability, are common in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). The Frontal 
      Behaviour Inventory (FBI) is a useful instrument for the evaluation of 
      behavioural disorders in neurodegenerative diseases. The main goal of the present 
      study was to explore the psychometric properties of the FBI in PSP. DESIGN, 
      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: FBI was administered to the PSP-NET cohort including 
      Italian patients diagnosed according to the Movement Disorder Society criteria. 
      Patients underwent a clinical interview, a motor evaluation, extensive cognitive 
      and behavioural testing. RESULTS: Two hundred and eight subjects were included in 
      this study. The internal consistency was high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.868) and no 
      improvement of this value was noted upon removal of any item. FBI showed also 
      good acceptability, reliability and validity. The standard error of measurement 
      (SEM) value for FBI total score was 0.169 [SEM = SD √ (1 - Cronbach's alpha)]. 
      Factor analysis indicated a five-factor structure: Apathy, Behavioural disorders, 
      Impulsivity, Motor and speech frontal behaviour and Executive disorders that 
      explained the 54.92% of the total variance. Linear regression analysis showed 
      that global cognitive impairment significantly affects both Apathy and Motor and 
      speech frontal behaviour factors. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, FBI is a reliable 
      and valid tool for the assessment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PSP, despite 
      some constructs, such as euphoria and irritability, are better measured by the 
      NPI. Two third of the cohort was represented by Richardson's syndrome, thus our 
      data are mainly applicable to such common phenotype. Such data are useful in both 
      clinical and research settings to plan adequate therapeutic interventions and to 
      improve the quality of life of PSP patients and their caregivers.

TI  - Inpatient preferences among patients with multiple chronic conditions in China: A 
      discrete choice experiment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple chronic conditions (MCC) have become a leading cause of low 
      vitality and high mortality among the Chinese population. Although a series of 
      policies has been implemented to promote patients' rational access to health 
      care, patients still prefer a higher level of inpatient service, hampering the 
      efficient utilization of resources in county hospitals, which are the first point 
      of contact for inpatient care. Thus, this study aimed to identify the factors 
      that affect MCC patients' inpatient preferences and the extent to which these 
      factors influence their decisions, thereby guiding inpatient service utilization 
      among MCC patients. METHODS: Five attributes (institution scale, waiting time for 
      hospital admission, presence of acquaintances, travel time from residence to 
      hospital, and out-of-pocket expenses per visit) were identified to estimate 
      inpatient choice for MCC patients through a discrete choice experiment. A partial 
      factor analysis was performed to generate selection sets. Data were collected 
      from MCC patients aged between 35 and 75 years, in Fuqing City, China. A mixed 
      logit model was used to analyse MCC patients' preferences for each attribute. 
      Willingness to pay was estimated by regression coefficients, and interaction 
      terms were included in the model to estimate the heterogeneity of inpatient 
      preferences among MCC patients. RESULTS: A total of 504 valid questionnaires were 
      included in the analysis. The most important attribute of patients when choosing 
      inpatient care is out-of-pocket expenses per visit, followed by travel time from 
      residence to hospital, waiting time for hospital admission, institution scale, 
      and presence of acquaintances. In addition, patients were willing to pay ¥1253, 
      ¥434, and ¥323 for shorter times from the residence to the hospital, larger 
      institutional scale, and beds available on the day, respectively. The findings of 
      the interaction analysis indicated that age and gender also influence MCC 
      patients' inpatient preferences. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of the 
      inpatient preferences of MCC patients. Increasing inpatient insurance 
      reimbursement rates, bolstering the leading role of district and county hospitals 
      in the area, and strengthening information systems will empower district and 
      county hospitals to effectively serve as the first point of contact for inpatient 
      care.

TI  - LAsting Symptoms after Oesophageal Resectional Surgery (LASORS): multicentre 
      validation cohort study.
LID - 10.1093/bjs/znae319 [doi]
LID - znae319
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term symptom burden and health-related quality-of-life outcomes 
      after curative oesophageal cancer treatment are poorly understood. Existing tools 
      are cumbersome and do not address the post-treatment population specifically. The 
      aim of this study was to validate the six-symptom LASORS tool for identifying 
      patients after curative oesophageal cancer treatment with poor health-related 
      quality of life and to assess its clinical utility. METHODS: Between 2015 and 
      2019, patients from 15 UK centres who underwent curative-intent oesophageal 
      cancer treatment, and were disease-free at least 1 year after surgery, were 
      invited to participate in the study and complete LASORS and European Organisation 
      for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OG25 questionnaires. 
      Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to examine the accuracy 
      of the LASORS tool for identifying patients with poor health-related quality of 
      life. RESULTS: A total of 263 patients completed the questionnaire. Four of the 
      six LASORS symptoms were associated with poor health-related quality of life: 
      reduced energy (OR 2.13 (95% c.i. 1.45 to 3.13)); low mood (OR 1.86 (95% c.i. 
      1.20 to 2.88)); diarrhoea more than three times a day unrelated to eating (OR 
      1.48 (95% c.i. 1.06 to 2.07)); and bloating or cramping after eating (OR 1.35 
      (95% c.i. 1.03 to 1.77)). The LASORS tool showed good diagnostic accuracy with an 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.858 for identifying 
      patients with poor health-related quality of life. CONCLUSION: The six-symptom 
      LASORS tool generated a reliable model for identification of patients with poor 
      health-related quality of life after curative treatment for oesophageal cancer. 
      This is the first tool of its kind to be prospectively validated in the 
      post-esophagectomy population. Clinical utility lies in identification of 
      patients at risk of poor health-related quality of life, ease of use of the tool, 
      and in planning survivorship services.

      Screening Tool (BAST) in chronic traumatic brain injury.
LID - IB24064 [pii]
LID - 10.1071/IB24064 [doi]
AB  - Background The Behavioural Assessment Screening Tool (BAST), which measures 
      self-reported neurobehavioural symptoms experienced by adults with traumatic 
      brain injury (TBI), was specifically developed as a self-reported measure for 
      remote symptom reporting. Our aim was to assess the convergent, discriminant, and 
      known-groups validity of the BAST among community-dwelling adults with TBI. 
      Methods We assessed correlations and group differences with previously validated 
      measures in two existing datasets (n =111, n =134). Other measures were the 
      Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (depression), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 
      (anxiety), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Frontal Systems Behavior Scale 
      (Executive Dysfunction, Apathy, Disinhibition), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (Fatigue), Aggression 
      Questionnaire (anger, hostility, physical and verbal aggression), and Alcohol Use 
      Disorders Identification Test (alcohol misuse). Results BAST subscales had 
      stronger correlations with measures of similar (|r |=0.602-0.828, P r 
      |=0.364-0.589, P r |d =1.2-1.9) for known groups with moderate-severe depression, 
      moderate-severe anxiety, fatigue, problematic disinhibited and frontal executive 
      behaviours, and alcohol misuse. Results support the construct validity of the 
      BAST subscales. Conclusion(s) The BAST demonstrated good convergent, 
      discriminant, and known-groups validity, supporting its use for remote 
      self-reported symptom reporting to improve chronic symptom monitoring in 
      community-dwelling adults with TBI.

LID - 10.1007/s40263-024-01139-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      that causes psychiatric and neurological symptoms, including involuntary and 
      irregular muscle movements (chorea). Chorea can disrupt activities of daily 
      living, pose safety issues, and may lead to social withdrawal. The vesicular 
      monoamine transporter 2 inhibitors tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and 
      valbenazine are approved treatments that can reduce chorea. OBJECTIVE: This post 
      hoc analysis was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy among participants who 
      received high-dosage deutetrabenazine treatment (> 48 mg/d) in ARC-HD, an 
      open-label study that assessed long-term safety and efficacy of deutetrabenazine 
      for the treatment of chorea in HD in adults. METHODS: ARC-HD was a single-arm, 
      two-cohort, open-label study. Participants either successfully completed the 
      First-HD study or switched overnight from tetrabenazine to deutetrabenazine. 
      Participants were dosed with deutetrabenazine in a response-driven manner 
      (maximum 72 mg/d allowed). For the current analysis, exposure-adjusted incidence 
      rates (EAIRs) for adverse events of interest were analyzed according to daily 
      dosage (≤ 48 mg/d versus > 48 mg/d), and total maximal chorea (TMC) scores were 
      analyzed by cohort during the stable-dose period. RESULTS: In total, 116 of the 
      119 participants enrolled in ARC-HD entered the stable-dose period, where no 
      apparent differences were seen in EAIRs when receiving deutetrabenazine dosages 
      ≤ 48 mg/d (exposure = 177.7 person-years) compared with > 48 mg/d 
      (exposure = 74.1 person-years). Similar results were found among the subset of 
      participants who received deutetrabenazine dosages > 48 mg/d at least once during 
      the study (n = 49, 42%) when their dosage was ≤ 48 mg/d 
      (exposure = 37.9 person-years) versus > 48 mg/d (74.1 person-years). Efficacy 
      analyses were conducted for participants who had TMC scores available (rollover 
      cohort, n = 77; switch cohort, n = 35). For most participants, the lowest 
      deutetrabenazine dosage needed to achieve a TMC response (≥ 30% improvement from 
      baseline) was between 24 and 48 mg/d in both the rollover (n = 57, 74.0%) and 
      switch (n = 16, 46.0%) cohorts. Whereas the dosage needed for a TMC response was 
      independent of baseline TMC score in the rollover cohort, participants with 
      higher baseline TMC scores in the switch cohort required higher dosages to 
      achieve a TMC response during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: In this open-label, 
      long-term study, some participants received deutetrabenazine dosing > 48 mg/d to 
      achieve adequate chorea control. There was no new safety concern or incremental 
      change in the safety profile between dosages of ≤ 48 mg/d and > 48 mg/d. These 
      results include dosages that have not been approved for clinical use, however, 
      they increase our understanding of safety and tolerability of deutetrabenazine 
      doses. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: ARC-HD (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: 
      NCT01897896); First-HD (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01795859).

OAB - ARC-HD was a medical study in which participants took a medicine called 
      deutetrabenazine. Deutetrabenazine is used to treat unplanned movements known as 
      chorea, which happen in participants who have Huntington disease. At the start of 
      the ARC-HD study, all participants took 6 milligrams per day (mg/d) of the 
      medicine. Each week, the doctor could give them more medicine, but not more than 
      72 mg/d. The doctor checked if the medicine helped to lower their chorea and if 
      any safety concerns occurred. The highest amount of the medicine that is allowed 
      in the USA is 48 mg/d. Some participants took more than that. We wanted to learn 
      more about the safety (side effects) and the chorea in participants who took more 
      than 48 mg/d. Participants who took more than 48 mg/d had no new side effects of 
      interest. They also reported the same number of side effects as participants who 
      took 48 mg/d or less. For most participants, the lowest amount of medicine they 
      needed to lower their chorea was between 24 and 48 mg/d.

TI  - Social Disengagement in Post-Pandemic China: A Translation, Validation and 
      Cross-Cultural Comparison of the Pandemic Disengagement Syndrome Scale.
PG  - e14279
LID - 10.1111/jep.14279 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In contrast to abundant research on the various acute mental effects 
      of COVID-19, the long-term influences of the pandemic are still underexplored in 
      China owing to the paucity of assessment tools. The Pandemic Disengagement 
      Syndrome Scale (PDSS) assesses people's social disengagement as a lasting 
      psychological consequence in Western countries during the post-COVID-19 pandemic 
      era. However, its generalizability across cultures is untested. OBJECTIVES: The 
      present studies aimed to validate Chinese PDSS and compare disengagement syndrome 
      levels among China, the United States and Italy. METHOD: In Study 1, a Chinese 
      version of the PDSS was developed, psychometric properties including factor 
      structure, internal consistency, measurement invariance across gender and 
      country, discriminant validity, and test-retest reliability were tested. Study 2 
      examined demographic differences in the pandemic disengagement syndrome in China 
      and compared Chinese PDSS scores and those in the United States and Italy 
      (Ns = 415(US), 455(Italy), 826(China)). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The findings 
      indicated that disengagement syndrome may exist among Chinese people even 
      substantially after the acute phases of the pandemic. Meanwhile, the Chinese PDSS 
      demonstrating acceptable psychometric features can be a valid instrument to 
      assess the syndrome. Several possible reasons for the persistence of 
      disengagement in China are discussed.

TI  - Content Validation of the QOL-B-RD and PROMIS-F SF-7a to Measure Respiratory and 
      Fatigue Symptoms of MAC Lung Disease.
PG  - 935-976
LID - 10.1007/s12325-024-03064-9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Quality of Life-Bronchiectasis (QOL-B) questionnaire and 
      Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Short Form 
      v1.0-Fatigue 7a (PROMIS-F SF-7a) have the potential to measure respiratory and 
      fatigue symptoms, respectively, in patients with Mycobacterium avium complex 
      (MAC) lung disease but have not yet been evaluated for content validity in this 
      population. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted in 
      United States patients with a current MAC lung disease diagnosis. Concept 
      elicitation (CE) interviews were conducted (n = 25 participants) to identify key 
      respiratory and fatigue symptoms expressed as important and relevant to patients 
      with MAC lung disease and to evaluate the appropriateness of the QOL-B and 
      PROMIS-F SF-7a to measure these symptoms. Cognitive interviews (CIs) were 
      subsequently conducted (n = 20 participants) to evaluate the relevance, 
      comprehensibility, and appropriateness of the QOL-B respiratory domain (QOL-B-RD) 
      and PROMIS-F SF-7a. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded for 
      qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The most important or relevant respiratory 
      symptom concepts to CE interview participants were "cough," "shortness of breath 
      during activity," and "mucus/phlegm." The most important or relevant fatigue 
      symptom concepts were "tiredness," "lack of energy," and "tire easily/low 
      stamina." These symptoms are covered by existing items in the QOL-B-RD and 
      PROMIS-F SF-7a. Cognitive interview participants' feedback confirmed the item 
      content, response options, concept attributes, and recall period for each 
      instrument were effective, relevant, and meaningful to most patients with MAC 
      lung disease. Based on Wave 1 findings, the QOL-B instructions were revised for 
      the Wave 2 interviews, where the text referencing "bronchiectasis" was replaced 
      with "your lung condition." Participant feedback in Wave 2 confirmed the revised 
      instruction wording was easily understood and appropriate. CONCLUSIONS: The study 
      results support the content validity of the QOL-B-RD and PROMIS-F SF-7a, which 
      were shown to be relevant and appropriate to evaluate respiratory and fatigue 
      symptoms, respectively, in patients with MAC lung disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the 
      Epilepsy-Related Apathy Scale (E-RAS) in adults with epilepsy. METHODS: In this 
      methodological study, the E-RAS was translated into Turkish using standard 
      procedures and assessed for content validity by a panel of 8 experts. The draft 
      scale was piloted with 10 people to ensure comprehensibility of the questions. 
      For psychometric validation, the Turkish version of the scale was administered to 
      209 native Turkish speakers over 18 years of age who had epilepsy for at least 
      1 year and had been using antiepileptic drugs for at least 1 year. RESULTS: 
      Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was performed for construct 
      validity. Internal consistency analysis yielded Cronbach's alpha reliability 
      coefficients of 0.813 for the whole scale and 0.802-0.864 for the subscales. In 
      exploratory factor analysis, 9 of the original 24 items were removed (factor 
      loadings < 0.30) and the 4 subscales were condensed to 2, called "Motivational 
      and Emotional" and "Self-Regulatory and Cognitive". CONCLUSION: The 15-item, 
      2-dimensional Turkish version of the E-RAS was determined to be valid and 
      reliable for use in adults with epilepsy in the Turkish population.

TI  - Psychometric evaluation of the Functional Assessment of chronic illness

AB  - PURPOSE: To provide further evidence on the psychometric properties of the 
      Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) in 
      moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD), and to determine thresholds 
      for meaningful improvement in fatigue. METHODS: The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item 
      patient-reported outcome measure (range, 0-52) assessing fatigue over the 
      previous week. Using pooled data from the Phase 3 VIVID-1 study of moderately to 
      severely active CD, psychometric properties of FACIT-Fatigue were evaluated up to 
      Week 52. The Patient Global Rating of Severity (PGRS) and Patient Global 
      Impression of Change (PGIC) were used as primary anchors to estimate the 
      FACIT-Fatigue score change representing meaningful improvement. RESULTS: 
      Psychometric analyses included 1065 adults. The FACIT-Fatigue demonstrated good 
      internal consistency, and correlations between individual items and the total 
      score were moderate to strong. The FACIT-Fatigue score showed moderate to strong 
      correlations with other patient-reported assessments and weak correlations with 
      endoscopic/laboratory assessments. The FACIT-Fatigue differentiated between 
      distinct groups of participants varying in disease severity, quality of life, and 
      fatigue based on PGRS and other assessments. FACIT-Fatigue improvements during 
      the study differed significantly between most PGRS change and PGIC categories. 
      Anchor-based estimates suggested a 6-9-point increase in the FACIT-Fatigue total 
      score as meaningful improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The FACIT-Fatigue demonstrated 
      strong psychometric properties in the VIVID-1 population of adults with 
      moderately to severely active CD and determined a FACIT-Fatigue score change 
      threshold representing meaningful improvement. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03926130.

OAB - Fatigue, a state of extreme tiredness, exhaustion, or lack of energy that does 
      not get better after sleeping, is one of the symptoms of Crohn’s disease that has 
      the most impact on patients’ lives. People can use the Functional Assessment of 
      Chronic Illness Therapy–Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue), a survey of 13 questions, to 
      rate their own fatigue from the previous week. This study explored how well the 
      FACIT-Fatigue assessed fatigue in people with Crohn’s disease who took part in a 
      clinical trial. People in the trial completed the FACIT-Fatigue as well as other 
      surveys at different times. FACIT-Fatigue scores related to scores on other 
      surveys about their Crohn’s disease. FACIT-Fatigue was able to tell apart groups 
      of people expected to have different levels of fatigue based on their scores on 
      other surveys. FACIT-Fatigue scores improved when people improved based on other 
      surveys, confirming that the FACIT-Fatigue was responsive to changes in health. 
      Finally, we estimated how much of a change in the FACIT-Fatigue score would 
      represent a meaningful improvement in fatigue to people such as those in the 
      trial. These findings show that the FACIT-Fatigue survey can be used to measure 
      fatigue in people with Crohn’s disease, and to tell us whether their experience 
      of fatigue has improved over time (for example, when they take a medicine).

TI  - Exploring the categorization of barriers to physical activity and their 
      associations with leisure time physical activity and body mass index in a sample 
      of Jamaican adults.
LID - kaaf085 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/abm/kaaf085 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over 80% of Jamaicans are not meeting World Health Organization 
      physical activity guidelines, and over 50% are overweight or obese. Research on 
      barriers to physical activity and their associations with physical activity 
      engagement among Jamaican adults is limited. This study explores the measurement 
      and categorization of barriers to physical activity in Jamaican adults to inform 
      the design and implementation of behavioral physical activity-promoting 
      interventions. PURPOSE: This study applied a psychometric approach to explore the 
      perception of barriers to physical activity and their associations with leisure 
      time physical activity (LTPA) and body mass index (BMI) in Jamaican adults. 
      METHODS: A total of 506 Jamaican adults completed self-report measures of 
      demographic data, height, and weight (to calculate BMI), barriers to physical 
      activity, and LTPA in a cross-sectional survey design. Exploratory structural 
      equation modeling was used to determine the best-fitting model for responses to 
      the barriers to physical activity (BPA) scale. Structural equation modeling was 
      used to examine the associations among BPA, LTPA, and BMI. RESULTS: A 15-item BPA 
      scale with 2 categories of barriers was identified: (1) psychosocial (PS-BPA; 7 
      items; eg, lack of self-motivation or confidence) and (2) 
      environmental/demographic (ED-BPA; 8 items; safety or financial/cost issues) was 
      identified. PS-BPA but not ED-BPA meaningfully associated with LTPA. LTPA was 
      negatively associated with BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial barriers may at least 
      partially explain why most Jamaican adults do not meet global physical activity 
      guidelines. Psychosocial correlates of physical activity should be emphasized 
      when investigating and targeting physical activity barriers in behavioral 
      interventions among Jamaican adults.

OAB - Over 80% of Jamaicans do not engage in sufficient physical activity (PA) for 
      health. Knowledge of the culturally relevant barriers to PA in Jamaican adults is 
      limited. Targeting these barriers to PA engagement in behavioral PA-promoting 
      interventions for Jamaican adults has the potential to increase PA in the 
      population. This study explores barriers to PA engagement in a sample of Jamaican 
      adults. Self-reported data on barriers to PA, leisure time physical activity 
      (physical activity done in one’s free time; LTPA), and body mass index (BMI) from 
      506 Jamaican adults were analyzed. The findings revealed 2 categories of barriers 
      to PA: (1) psychosocial (eg, lack of motivation) and (2) 
      environmental/demographic (eg, financial/cost issues). Psychosocial, but not 
      environmental/demographic, barriers to PA were associated with lower LTPA. Lower 
      LTPA was associated with increased BMI. These findings suggest that behavioral 
      PA-promoting interventions for Jamaican adults should primarily target 
      psychosocial barriers to PA.

      symptoms: Preliminary findings.
PG  - e70055
LID - 10.1002/dad2.70055 [doi]
LID - e70055
AB  - BACKGROUND: Late-life depression (LLD) is a heterogenous disorder related to 
      cognitive decline and neurodegenerative processes, raising a need for the 
      development of novel biomarkers. We sought to provide preliminary evidence for 
      acoustic speech signatures sensitive to LLD and their relationship to depressive 
      dimensions. METHODS: Forty patients (24 female, aged 65-82 years) were assessed 
      with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Vocal features were extracted from 
      speech samples (reading a pre-written text) and tested as classifiers of LLD 
      using random forest and XGBoost models. Post hoc analyses examined the 
      relationship between these acoustic features and specific depressive dimensions. 
      RESULTS: The classification models demonstrated moderate discriminative ability 
      for LLD with receiver operating characteristic = 0.78 for random forest and 0.84 
      for XGBoost in an out-of-sample testing set. The top classifying features were 
      most strongly associated with the apathy dimension (R (2) = 0.43). DISCUSSION: 
      Acoustic vocal features that may support the diagnosis of LLD are preferentially 
      associated with apathy. HIGHLIGHTS: The depressive dimensions in late-life 
      depression (LLD) have different cognitive correlates, with apathy characterized 
      by more pronounced cognitive impairment.Acoustic speech features can predict LLD. 
      Using acoustic features, we were able to train a random forest model to predict 
      LLD in a held-out sample.Acoustic speech features that predict LLD are 
      preferentially associated with apathy. These results indicate a predominance of 
      apathy in the vocal signatures of LLD, and suggest that the clinical 
      heterogeneity of LLD should be considered in development of acoustic markers.

LID - 10.3390/ijerph22010082 [doi]
LID - 82
AB  - The study aimed to investigate the reliability, construct, and discriminant 
      validity of the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire 3 (BREQ-3) for 
      evaluating motivational regulations and self-determination for exercise in 
      Brazilian adults aged 50 years or older. The study assessed motivation for 
      exercise, peripheral muscle strength, physical performance, functional capacity, 
      cardiovascular fitness, and frailty phenotype. Two raters independently applied 
      the BREQ-3. The reliability was evaluated using internal consistency, test-retest 
      reliability, and agreement. Construct validity was tested with Spearman's 
      correlation coefficient and discriminant validity with the Kruskal-Wallis test. 
      Eighty individuals participated in the reliability study, and 136 participated in 
      the validation study. Motivational regulation and Self-Determination Index (SDI) 
      internal consistency ranged from 0.55 to 0.82. Test-retest reliability ranged 
      from 0.77 (95% CI 0.64-0.85) to 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.94), and inter-rater ranged 
      from 0.80 (95% CI 0.68-0.87) to 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.95), except for amotivation, 
      which had poor inter-rater and test-retest reliability. Additionally, moderate to 
      weak correlations between various types of motivation and physical function tests 
      were found (p < 0.05). Frail and pre-frail participants had lower SDI, 
      integrated, and intrinsic motivation regulation than non-frail individuals (p < 
      0.05). This study confirmed the reliability, construct, and discriminative 
      validity of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the BREQ-3 for evaluating 
      motivational regulations and self-determination for exercise in older adults.

TI  - Cognitive impairment predicts medication discrepancies in Huntington's Disease: 
      patient self-report compared to pharmacy records.
PG  - 55

AB  - BACKGROUND: Proper medication reconciliation (= comparing the accuracy of 
      patient-reported medication use with pharmacy records) could prevent potentially 
      dangerous situations such as drug-drug interactions and hospitalization. This is 
      particularly important when patients rely on multiple medications, such as in 
      neurodegenerative disorders like Huntington's Disease (HD). Currently, it is 
      unknown how often medication discrepancies occur in HD patients and which factors 
      contribute to the discrepancies. OBJECTIVE: Identify prognostic factors of 
      medication discrepancies in HD, using patient-reported medication use and local 
      pharmacy records. METHODS: With 134 pre- and manifest HD patients, we performed a 
      multivariable logistic regression analysis with medication discrepancy as 
      dependent variable (pharmacy records as reference value) and sex, CAP score, 
      disease status (pre- or manifest HD), number of concomitant medications taken, 
      presence of an informal caregiver, Unified Huntington's Disease Rating 
      Scale-Total Functioning Capacity, unified cognitive Z-score and Problem Behaviors 
      Assessment-short characteristic scores for depression, anxiety, and apathy as 
      independent variables. RESULTS: Medication discrepancies were reported 
      frequently, both in premanifest (43.2%) and manifest HD subjects (36.7%). 
      Impaired cognition significantly predicted medication discrepancies 
      (beta = -0.688, SE 0.27, p = 0.011). All other variables were non-significant. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of HD disease status and stage, patient self-reported 
      medication use is not a reliable source, especially in those with impaired 
      cognitive function. The presence of an informal caregiver and the absence of 
      polypharmacy, depression, anxiety and apathy do not influence self-reported 
      medication accuracy. Objective verification of medication use with HD patients' 
      local pharmacy is recommended. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ICTRP-NL-OMON55123,

AB  - The aim of the study was to modify the Amotivation Toward Exercise Scale-2 by 
      dropping the outcome amotivation beliefs subscale while retaining the capacity, 
      effort, value, and task characteristics amotivation beliefs. Data from 515 Greek 
      nonexerciser adults aged 19-64 years and 399 Greek nonexerciser older adults aged 
      65-82 years, men and women, supported the latent four-factor structure of the 
      Revised Amotivation Toward Exercise Scale-2 scores within each sample separately. 
      The hierarchical model was also supported. Measurement invariance of Revised 
      Amotivation Toward Exercise Scale-2 scores was supported across groups of gender, 
      age, body mass index, and educational levels within adults and older adults. 
      Configural measurement invariance supported a replicable factor structure across 
      adults and older adults. Metric and strong invariance was supported across 
      middle-aged and older adults but not between younger and older adults. Full 
      measurement invariance was supported between younger and middle-aged adults.

LID - 10.1017/S1041610224000711 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Among participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) we estimated the 
      minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in apathy symptom severity on 
      three scales. DESIGN: Retrospective anchor- and distribution-based analyses of 
      change in apathy symptom scores. SETTING: Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate 
      Trial (ADMET) and ADMET 2 randomized controlled trials conducted at three and ten 
      clinics specialized in dementia care in United States and Canada, respectively. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and sixty participants (60 ADMET, 200 ADMET 2) with 
      clinically significant apathy in Alzheimer's disease. MEASUREMENTS: The Clinical 
      Global Impression of Change in Apathy scale was used as the anchor measure and 
      the MCID on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Apathy (NPI-A), Dementia Apathy 
      Interview and Rating (DAIR), and Apathy Evaluation Scale-Informant (AES-I) were 
      estimated with linear mixed models across all study visits. The estimated 
      thresholds were evaluated with performance metrics. RESULTS: Among the MCID was a 
      decrease of four points (95% CI: -4.0 to -4.8) on the NPI-A, 0.56 points (95% CI: 
      -0.47 to -0.65) on the DAIR, and three points on the AES-I (95% CI: -0.9 to 
      -5.4). Distribution-based analyses were largely consistent with the anchor-based 
      analyses. The MCID across the three measures showed ∼60% accuracy. Sensitivity 
      analyses found that MMSE scores and apathy severity at baseline influenced the 
      estimated MCID. CONCLUSIONS: MCIDs for apathy on three scales will help evaluate 
      treatment efficacy at the individual level. However, the modest correspondence 
      between MCID and clinical impression of change suggests the need to consider 
      other scales.

TI  - Validation of the Japanese version of the Social Functioning in Dementia scale 
      and COVID-19 pandemic's impact on social function in mild cognitive impairment 
      and mild dementia.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to psychometrically evaluate and validate a Japanese version 
      of the Social Functioning in Dementia scale (SF-DEM-J) and investigate changes in 
      social function in people with dementia during the coronavirus disease-19 
      (COVID-19) pandemic. DESIGN: We interviewed people with mild cognitive impairment 
      (MCI) and mild dementia and their caregivers during June 2020-March 2021 to 
      validate patient- and caregiver-rated SF-DEM-J and compared their scores at 
      baseline (April 2020 to May 2020) and at 6-8 months (January 2021 to March 2021) 
      during a time of tighter COVID-19 restrictions. SETTING: The neuropsychology 
      clinic in the Department of Psychiatry at Osaka University Hospital and 
      outpatient clinic in the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at Daini Osaka 
      Police Hospital, Japan. PARTICIPANTS: 103 dyads of patients and caregivers. 
      MEASUREMENTS: SF-DEM-J, Mini-Mental State Examination, Neuropsychiatric 
      Inventory, UCLA Loneliness Scale, and Apathy Evaluation Scale. RESULTS: The 
      scale's interrater reliability was excellent and test-retest reliability was 
      substantial. Content validity was confirmed for the caregiver-rated SF-DEM-J, and 
      convergent validity was moderate. Caregiver-rated SF-DEM-J was associated with 
      apathy, irritability, loneliness, and cognitive impairment. The total score of 
      caregiver-rated SF-DEM-J and the score of Section 2, "communication with others," 
      significantly improved at 6-8 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The SF-DEM-J is 
      acceptable as a measure of social function in MCI and mild dementia. Our results 
      show that the social functioning of people with dementia, especially 
      communicating with others, improved during the COVID-19 pandemic, probably as a 
      result of adaptation to the restrictive life.

TI  - Huntington's disease at work: The effect of profession-specific requirements as 
      related to clinical characteristics on work outcome.
PG  - 547-555
LID - 10.1177/18796397241288161 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In most Huntington's disease expanded gene carriers (HDEGC), losing 
      work capacity is the first sign of functional decline. Cognitive deterioration, 
      motor dysfunction, and psychiatric disturbances are associated with or predict 
      work outcomes in HD. The role of profession-specific requirements, however, has 
      not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the relationship between 
      work outcomes, clinical characteristics, burnout, and profession-specific 
      requirements in HDEGC. We hypothesize that burnout-like symptoms are associated 
      with mild apathy and that profession-specific requirements influence clinical 
      characteristics affecting work capacity in HD. METHODS: A cohort of 117 HDEGC 
      (CAG repeat ≥36) participated in the "HD-work" study at Leiden University Medical 
      Center. Participants were 18-67 years old, either, worked at baseline, or had 
      lost their job within two years. The Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale 
      assessed motor abilities, global functioning, and cognition. The HD-work 
      questionnaire and the 'Utrecht Burn Out Scale' assessed work problems and 
      burnout. Statistical methods included descriptive statistics, Pearson 
      correlations, Cronbachs alpha, t-tests, and logistic regressions. RESULTS: 
      Burnout-like symptoms did not differ between those with full and reduced working 
      capacity and were not more prevalent in HD than in the general Dutch population. 
      No significant effect was found between work outcomes and profession-specific 
      requirements, even when adjusted for clinical characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      study suggests that profession-specific requirements do not significantly impact 
      work ability among individuals with HD in early phases of HD. Workplace 
      adjustments should be tailored to individual preferences rather than 
      profession-specific demands. Burnout-like symptoms did not affect work capacity 
      or relate to apathy.

      study].
PG  - 1208-1221
LID - 10.1007/s00103-024-03950-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is an unspecific symptom complex characterized by tiredness, 
      lack of energy, and lack of concentration and is of considerable public health 
      relevance, due to its links with incapacity for work, risk of accidents, and 
      increased need for healthcare. METHODS: The analyses are based on data from 9766 
      adults of the telephone survey "Gesundheit in Deutschland aktuell (GEDA)" 2023. 
      Fatigue was recorded using the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), a validated 
      instrument with 10 questions for self-assessment of fatigue. The scale was 
      dichotomized into yes (at least mild to moderate fatigue) versus no (no fatigue). 
      Population-weighted prevalences of fatigue and associated sociodemographic and 
      health-related factors were calculated in descriptive analyses and multivariable 
      Poisson regression. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of fatigue in adults in 
      Germany is 29.7% (95% CI 28.1-31.2), is highest in 18- to 29-year-olds (39.6% 
      (95% CI 35.0-44.4)), and decreases in the age groups up to 65-79 years (20.6% 
      (95% CI 18.2-23.3)). It is higher again in the very old age group (33.2% (95% CI 
      28.9-37.7)). Women have a higher risk of fatigue than men (aRR 1.19 (95% CI 
      1.08-1.32)). Fatigue is significantly associated with age, lower education, 
      chronic illness, depression, and long COVID, regardless of covariates. 
      DISCUSSION: GEDA 2023 is one of the few population-based studies to have 
      collected data on fatigue. The results allow estimates to be made for Germany on 
      the frequency of fatigue and the significance of physical, psychological, and 
      social influencing factors. They can be used as a reference or as a basis for 
      trends over time as part of continuous health monitoring in Germany.

PG  - 785-787
LID - 10.1080/21678421.2024.2328579 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative condition 
      with observable cognitive and behavioral impairment. The Edinburgh Cognitive and 
      Behavioral ALS Screen (ECAS) is a tool developed specifically for people with ALS 
      (pwALS) and previously translated into Russian, but the psychometric properties 
      have not yet been explored. The aim was to explore and determine the psychometric 
      properties of the Russian-version of ECAS (ECAS-R). METHODS: 56 Russian speaking 
      pwALS, 32 of their caregivers and 26 healthy controls were recruited for the 
      study. They completed the ECAS-R, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and 
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). King Staging System was also utilized. 
      Internal consistency, divergent and convergent validity, as well as 
      culturally-derived cutoff scores of ECAS-R were determined. RESULTS: The internal 
      consistency of ECAS-R was good (Cronbach's alpha = 0.73). Convergent validity was 
      observed though a strong correlation between the ECAS-R and MoCA scores. No 
      correlation between ECAS-R and PHQ-9 were observed in terms of divergent 
      validity. Based on culturally-derived cutoff scores, 64.2% (N = 36) of pwALS 
      displayed cognitive impairment, with the most affected cognitive domains as 
      executive function and language. Apathy was the most common behavioral impairment 
      for pwALS followed by a loss of sympathy/empathy. CONCLUSIONS: The ECAS-R is 
      valid and reliable tool for the screening for the cognitive and behavioral 
      impairment in Russian-speaking pwALS, with culturally-derived cutoffs presented.

TI  - Co-Occurrence of Apathy and Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson Disease: 
      Variation across Multiple Measures.
PG  - 907-913
LID - 10.1093/arclin/acae036 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if the co-occurrence of apathy and impulse control 
      disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson disease is dependent on instrument selection and 
      assess the concurrent validity of three motivation measures by examining 
      interrelationships between them. METHOD: Ninety-seven cognitively normal 
      individuals with idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD) completed the Questionnaire 
      for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS) 
      and three apathy measures: the Apathy Scale, Lille Apathy Rating Scale, and Item 
      4 of the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale. 
      RESULTS: Fifty (51.5%) participants were classified as apathetic on at least one 
      measure, and only four individuals (4.3%) obtained clinically elevated scores on 
      all three measures. The co-occurrence of apathy and ICD varied across measures. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We observed a co-occurrence of apathy and ICDs in PD patients with 
      each apathy instrument; however, limited concurrent validity exists across 
      measures. This is important for future investigations into shared pathophysiology 
      and the design of future clinical trials aimed at improving the early detection 
      and treatment of these debilitating syndromes.

TI  - Applicability of a digital health application for cancer patients: a qualitative 
      non-participation analysis.
PG  - 1187
LID - 10.1186/s12913-024-11654-0 [doi]
LID - 1187
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of digital health applications (German acronym DiGA) for 
      comprehensive patient care is increasing rapidly. Patients with non-organic 
      insomnia can be prescribed an application to manage insomnia. Due to the high 
      prevalence of insomnia in patients with cancer, we were interested in the effect 
      of it and what barriers need to be overcome for its use. The focus of existing 
      studies on acceptance and benefits prompted us to emphasise the analysis of 
      barriers and thus to formulate possible solutions. METHODS: To analyse the 
      barriers of use, the study population (patients with self-reported tiredness or 
      sleep disturbance via validated instruments and cancer disease) was divided into 
      3 groups. In groups 1 (patients who refused to participate in advance) and 2 
      (patients who refused a prescription), short close-ended questionnaires were used 
      for non-response assessment by treating oncologists. Problem-centred guidelines 
      were used for the telephone interviews with group 3 (patients who did not provide 
      information on DiGA use). Alternatively, group 3 was invited to complete and 
      return the close-ended questionnaire. A quantitative analysis of the non-response 
      reasons was conducted using SPSS in groups 1 and 2, while MAXQDA was used for the 
      qualitative data in group 3. RESULTS: Patients refused to participate at several 
      stages of our study. Quantitative data are available for groups 1 and 2. In the 
      largest group 1, 62% of patients refused to participate due to non-subjective 
      sleep disturbance (177 out of 189 patients) during recruitment by treating 
      oncologists, despite high scores on the screening tool. In the small group 2 (11 
      out of 15), the most common reasons for withdrawal documented by the oncologists 
      were loss of interest and deteriorating health. The problem-centred qualitative 
      interviews with group 3 (17 patients) revealed that some of them used the 
      prescribed DiGA, despite not being included in the main study and being 
      categorized as lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Analysis of barriers to DiGA use 
      showed that reducing administrative barriers and providing digital and personal 
      support can increase acceptance of the use of DiGAs among cancer patients. 
      Additionally, screening tools can act as a door opener to further communication 
      regarding DiGAs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Register of Clinical Trials

TI  - Pattern of Nonmotor Symptoms in Patients with Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease in a 
      Tertiary Care Hospital of Rural Eastern India.
PG  - 45-49
LID - 10.59556/japi.72.0707 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) is associated with a spectrum of 
      nonmotor symptoms (NMS) that contribute as much to the burden of the disease as 
      the more obvious motor abnormalities. There is a paucity of literature 
      determining the association between NMS and the severity of IPD, especially in 
      rural eastern parts of India. AIMS OF STUDY: This study explores the frequency of 
      NMS in patients with IPD and determines the association between NMS and the 
      severity of IPD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study 
      involving 65 serially enrolled IPD patients (diagnosed as per United Kingdom 
      Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria) was 
      conducted over a period of 18 months. The patients were evaluated for disease 
      severity as per the Hoehn and Yahr scale (original) and were subsequently 
      evaluated with a predesigned and validated Parkinson's Disease Non-Motor Symptoms 
      Questionnaire. Pearson's Chi-squared test for independence of attributes or 
      Fisher's exact test was used for comparison of categorical variables across the 
      groups. Continuous variables were compared using a one-way analysis of variance 
      (ANOVA) test. RESULTS: The most common presenting NMS of IPD was low mood (n = 
      61; 93.85%), followed by apathy (n = 59; 90.77%), impaired concentration (n = 58; 
      89.23%), restless leg (n = 54; 83.08%), and tenesmus (n = 54; 83.08%). A majority 
      of the neuropsychiatric symptoms, autonomic dysfunctions, sleep abnormalities, 
      gastrointestinal manifestations, and sensory abnormalities individually showed a 
      statistically significant relation with the severity of IPD. CONCLUSION: Common 
      presenting NMS include neuropsychiatric manifestations, autonomic symptoms, 
      sleep-related symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations. Most of the NMS are 
      significantly related to disease severity.

TI  - Symptom Network Analysis and Unsupervised Clustering of Oncology Patients 
      Identifies Drivers of Symptom Burden and Patient Subgroups With Distinct Symptom 
      Patterns.
PG  - e70278

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interindividual variability in oncology patients' symptom experiences 
      poses significant challenges in prioritizing symptoms for targeted 
      intervention(s). In this study, computational approaches were used to unbiasedly 
      characterize the heterogeneity of the symptom experience of oncology patients to 
      elucidate symptom patterns and drivers of symptom burden. METHODS: Severity 
      ratings for 32 symptoms on the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale from 3088 
      oncology patients were analyzed. Gaussian Graphical Model symptom networks were 
      constructed for the entire cohort and patient subgroups identified through 
      unsupervised clustering of symptom co-severity patterns. Network characteristics 
      were analyzed and compared using permutation-based statistical tests. Differences 
      in demographic and clinical characteristics between subgroups were assessed using 
      multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Network analysis of the entire cohort 
      revealed three symptom clusters: constitutional, gastrointestinal-epithelial, and 
      psychological. Lack of energy was identified as central to the network which 
      suggests that it plays a pivotal role in patients' overall symptom experience. 
      Unsupervised clustering of patients based on shared symptom co-severity patterns 
      identified six patient subgroups with distinct symptom patterns and demographic 
      and clinical characteristics. The centrality of individual symptoms across the 
      subgroup networks differed which suggests that different symptoms need to be 
      prioritized for treatment within each subgroup. Age, treatment status, and 
      performance status were the strongest determinants of subgroup membership. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Computational approaches that combine unbiased stratification of 
      patients and in-depth modeling of symptom relationships can capture the 
      heterogeneity in patients' symptom experiences. When validated, the core symptoms 
      for each of the subgroups and the associated clinical determinants may inform 
      precision-based symptom management.

TI  - CADA-PRO: A Patient Questionnaire Measuring Key Cognitive, Motor, Emotional, and 
      Behavioral Outcomes in CADASIL.
PG  - 2439-2448
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.124.047692 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) of ischemic type, either 
      sporadic or genetic, as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical 
      infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), can impact the quality of daily life 
      on various cognitive, motor, emotional, or behavioral aspects. No instrument has 
      been developed to measure these outcomes from the patient's perspective. We thus 
      aimed to develop and validate a patient-reported questionnaire. METHODS: In a 
      development study, 79 items were generated by consensus between patients, family 
      representatives, and cSVD experts. A first sample of patients allowed assessing 
      the feasibility (missing data, floor and ceiling effect, and acceptability), 
      internal consistency, and dimensionality of a first set of items. Thereafter, in 
      a validation study, we tested a reduced version of the item set in a larger 
      sample to assess the feasibility, internal consistency, dimensionality, 
      test-retest reliability, concurrent validity, and sensitivity to change. RESULTS: 
      The scale was developed in 44 patients with cSVD and validated in a second sample 
      of 89 individuals (including 43 patients with CADASIL and 46 with another cSVD). 
      The final CADASIL Patient-Reported Outcome scale comprised 18 items covering 4 
      categories of consequences (depression/anxiety, attention/executive functions, 
      motor, and daily activities) of the disease. The proportion of missing data was 
      low, and no item displayed a major floor or ceiling effect. Both the internal 
      consistency and test-retest reliability were good (Cronbach alpha=0.95, 
      intraclass correlation coefficient=0.88). In patients with CADASIL, CADASIL 
      Patient-Reported Outcome scores correlated with the modified Rankin Scale, 
      Starkstein Apathy Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, Working Memory 
      Index, and trail making test times. In patients with other cSVDs, CADASIL 
      Patient-Reported Outcome correlated only with Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
      scale and Starkstein Apathy Scale. CONCLUSIONS: The CADASIL Patient-Reported 
      Outcome may be an innovative instrument for measuring patient-reported outcomes 
      in future cSVD trials. Full validation was obtained for its use in patients with 
      CADASIL, but further improvement is needed for its application in other cSVDs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the factorial structure, psychometric 
      properties, and diagnostic accuracy of the Persian version of the Lille Apathy 
      Rating Scale-Patient version (LARS-P) in stroke survivors. PARTICIPANTS: This 
      study comprised 105 stroke survivors and 41 healthy controls. METHODS AND 
      SETTING: Exploratory factor analysis was used to determine the factors of the 
      LARS-P. The acceptability, reliability, and validity of the LARS-P were also 
      assessed. Agreement between the LARS-P and the Lille Apathy Rating Scale-informed 
      version (LARS-I) was evaluated using the Bland-Altman plot. The diagnostic 
      accuracy of the LARS-P was determined by categorizing stroke survivors into 
      apathetic and nonapathetic groups based on the "diagnostic criteria of apathy." 
      RESULTS: The exploratory factor analysis showed 3 factors (action initiation and 
      social life; novelty and motivation; and emotional and self-awareness), 
      explaining 67.35% of the variance. Cronbach's alpha was 0.85 for between-items 
      and 0.74 for between-subscales. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC)(2,1) 
      was >0.88 for test-retest and inter-rater reliability. The LARS-P showed moderate 
      to strong correlations with the LARS-I and Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Apathy 
      subscale (r = 0.70-0.82). In addition, the LARS-P had significant moderate 
      correlations with 2 subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
      Scale, modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, and Lawton Instrumental Activities 
      of Daily Living (r or ƿ = 0.47-0.63). There was a 96.19% agreement between LARS-P 
      and LARS-I. The identified cutoff point (>17) for LARS-P exhibited 77.14% 
      sensitivity and 90% specificity in diagnosing apathetic and nonapathetic stroke 
      survivors. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The LARS-P exhibits acceptable 
      psychometric properties in stroke survivors, presenting a promising instrument 
      for assessing apathy through a multidimensional framework.

      diabetes incidence?
PG  - 757-767
LID - 10.1037/hea0001386 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Psychological factors, including psychological distress and 
      well-being, have been associated with cardiometabolic disease risk. Here, we 
      examined whether a psychological process, namely how individuals cope with 
      stressors, relates to such risk, which has been understudied. METHOD: During 
      2004-2006, 2,142 participants without heart disease and diabetes from the Midlife 
      in the U.S. study completed a validated coping inventory assessing six strategies 
      (positive reinterpretation and growth, active coping, planning, focus on and 
      venting of emotion, denial, and behavioral disengagement) and relevant 
      covariates. As a proxy for coping flexibility, participants were also classified 
      as having lower, moderate, or greater variability in their use of these 
      strategies. Heart disease and diabetes were documented in 2013-2015. Logistic 
      regressions modeled adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals 
      (CIs) of developing heart disease and diabetes, separately, with coping 
      exposures. RESULTS: In sociodemographic-adjusted models, greater use of adaptive 
      strategies predicted lower diabetes risk (e.g., positive reinterpretation and 
      growth: AOR = 0.83; 95% CI [0.72, 0.96]); estimates were weaker for maladaptive 
      strategies, and all strategies were unrelated to heart disease. All associations 
      for coping variability were null. In secondary analyses, greater use of adaptive 
      strategies predicted lower heart disease risk in more educated participants only 
      (e.g., active coping: AOR = 0.71; 95% CI [0.55, 0.92]) and lower diabetes risk in 
      females only (e.g., planning: AOR = 0.75; 95% CI [0.61, 0.91]). Results were 
      maintained additionally adjusting for health, behavioral, and social factors. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest sex and education differences in coping's 
      association with heart disease and diabetes. Future studies should recognize 
      adaptive strategies may be more potent for health among certain populations.

TI  - Acceptance of physical activity virtual reality games by residents of long-term 
      care facilities: a scoping review.
PG  - 2482-2490
LID - 10.1080/17483107.2023.2298839 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This scoping review aims to identify evidence on older adults' 
      acceptance of PA VR games in LTC facilities, describe research designs used, 
      define key acceptance concepts, and identify knowledge gaps for future research. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following Arksey and O'Malley's framework, data from 
      published and unpublished articles (Jan 2000-May 2023) were collected. Twelve 
      databases and additional sources were searched for studies on LTC residents 
      (≥65 years), PA video games (including VR and console games), acceptance, and 
      attitudes. Data extraction included article details, design, population, 
      intervention, outcomes, and limitations. RESULTS: Five studies met inclusion 
      criteria from 1628 initial titles. They assessed acceptance of PA VR games among 
      older adults in LTC facilities, showing varying levels of acceptance. Most 
      studies used analytical designs, including RCTs. Key concepts of VR acceptance 
      were poorly defined, with only one study using a validated TAM questionnaire. 
      Knowledge gaps highlight the need for further research to understand PA VR 
      acceptance among older adults in LTC facilities. CONCLUSION: Validated acceptance 
      questionnaires are needed in study of VR acceptance by older adults. Use of 
      qualitative and quantitative methods can enhance understanding of technology 
      acceptance, alongside exploration of individual, environmental, and age-related 
      factors. Detailed reporting of VR interventions is recommended to comprehend 
      acceptance factors.

OAB - Enhancing engagement: We suggest that physical activity (PA) virtual reality (VR) 
      games can improve engagement among long-term care (LTC) residents. By providing a 
      novel approach to rehabilitation, PA VR games have the potential to increase 
      motivation and participation, leading to improved outcomes.Promoting physical and 
      cognitive stimulation: VR games offer opportunities for both physical and 
      cognitive stimulation. By integrating these games into rehabilitation programs, 
      we can provide a more engaging and interactive experience for individuals 
      undergoing rehabilitation. This can contribute to motor skills development, 
      balance training, cognitive function, and overall well-being.Addressing barriers 
      to rehabilitation: Traditional rehabilitation approaches may face various 
      barriers, such as lack of interest, adherence issues, or limited resources. The 
      use of VR games can help overcome some of these barriers by offering a more 
      enjoyable and accessible rehabilitation experience. This is particularly 
      beneficial for individuals with mobility limitations or those residing in LTC 
      facilities.In summary, our study highlights the potential of incorporating VR 
      games into rehabilitation settings. By implementing these findings, we can 
      improve the acceptance and efficiency of rehabilitation practices, leading to 
      better rehabilitation outcomes for individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The apathy evaluation scale (AES) measures apathy, but its usefulness 
      as a screening tool in diverse populations is limited without translation into 
      more languages. To date, there is no reported translation of the AES into 
      Malayalam, a language spoken by over 32 million people in the southern Indian 
      state of Kerala. In the present study, we aimed to validate the Malayalam version 
      of the AES. METHODS: Six hundred sixty-one community-dwelling older adults 
      without dementia participating in the Kerala Einstein study completed the 
      Malayalam AES. We assessed the internal consistency and the validity of the 
      Malayalam AES, using another measure of apathy, as well as measures of depression 
      and anxiety. We also used principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the 
      dimensionality of the Malayalam AES. Finally, we assessed possible sex 
      differences in apathy. RESULTS: The Malayalam AES demonstrated high internal 
      consistency and good validity, and the results of our PCA indicate that it has a 
      three-component structure, as in the original English version and other 
      translated versions. We found that while overall apathy scores were similar, the 
      relationship with other neuropsychiatric symptoms differed by sex, with stronger 
      relationships found in male participants compared to female participants. 
      CONCLUSION: Our study provides another tool to screen for apathy in 
      non-English-speaking populations, an important early risk factor for cognitive 
      and functional decline, and enables future research across diverse cultures.

TI  - Level, Motivation and Barriers to Participate in Physical Activity among 
      Geriatric Population at Ahmedabad City, India: An Epidemiological Factsheet.
PG  - 299-306
LID - 10.5770/cgj.27.751 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the level of physical activity among geriatric 
      population, to determine the motivating factors for being active and identifying 
      barriers that prevent participants from engaging in physical activity. METHODS: A 
      community-based cross-sectional study was carried out at one of the wards within 
      Ahmedabad city following multi-stage random sampling. The calculated sample size 
      was 230. A pre-designed, validated, short version International Physical Activity 
      Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Behaviour Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-3) 
      were used for data collection by personal interview. From selected 
      sampling-frame, geriatric people residing in every 5th household were interviewed 
      after obtaining oral informed consent following simple-random sampling. RESULTS: 
      Of total 230 study participants, 67 (29.13%) were physically active (cumulative 
      for Category 2 and Category 3), while the remaining 163 (70.87%) were found 
      physically inactive (i.e., minimally active [Category 1]). Motivational scores, 
      particularly in identified regulation, showed higher median scores across 
      subdomains of the BREQ-3. Amotivation exhibited a strong negative correlation 
      with physical activity, while intrinsic regulation displayed a strong positive 
      correlation. CONCLUSION: More than two-third of study participants were 
      physically inactive. Level of educational status, type of previous occupation 
      involved, presence of addiction, BMI, electronic device usage duration per day 
      and presence of chronic illness were statistically significant determinants to 
      decide involvement of elderly people in category of physical activity. 
      Amotivation, external and introjected regulation had negative correlation with 
      physical activity, while intrinsic regulation and RAI (Relative Autonomy Index) 
      showed positive correlation with physical activity. None of the behavioural 
      regulators had statistically significant association with category of physical 
      activity.

LID - e080803
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship among patients' apathy, cognitive 
      impairment, depression, anxiety, and caregiver burden in amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS). DESIGN: A cross-sectional study design was used. SETTING: The 
      study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Wuhan, Hubei, China. PARTICIPANTS: 
      A total of 109 patients with ALS and their caregivers were included. OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Patients with ALS were screened using the Edinburgh Cognitive and 
      Behavioural Screen, Beck Depression Inventory-II, Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 
      and Apathy Scale to assess their cognition, depression, anxiety and apathy, 
      respectively. The primary caregivers completed the Zarit Burden Interview. The 
      association between apathy, cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety and 
      caregiver burden was analysed using logistic regression. Mediation models were 
      employed to investigate the mediating effect of patients' apathy on the 
      relationship between depression/anxiety and caregiver burden. RESULTS: Patients 
      in the high caregiver burden group exhibited significantly higher levels of 
      depression, anxiety and apathy compared with those in the low caregiver burden 
      group (p<0.05). There was a positive association observed between caregiver 
      burden and disease course (rs=0.198, p<0.05), depression (rs=0.189, p<0.05), 
      anxiety (rs=0.257, p<0.05) and apathy (rs=0.388, p<0.05). There was a negative 
      association between caregiver burden and the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale 
      (rs=-0.275, p<0.05). Apathy was an independent risk factor for higher caregiver 
      burden (OR 1.121, 95% CI 1.041 to 1.206, p<0.05). Apathy fully mediated the 
      relationship between depression and caregiver burden (β=0.35, 95% CI 0.16 to 
      0.54, p<0.05) while partially mediating the relationship between anxiety and 
      caregiver burden (β=0.34, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.52, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Apathy, 
      depression and anxiety exerted a detrimental impact on caregiver burden in 
      individuals with ALS. Apathy played a mediating role in the relationship between 
      depression and caregiver burden and between anxiety and caregiver burden. These 
      findings underscore the importance of identifying apathy and developing 
      interventions for its management within the context of ALS.

LID - 10.1177/08919887241227404 [doi]
AB  - Apathy can manifest in various neuropsychiatric conditions, as well as in 
      individuals who experience significant stressful life events or suffer from 
      underlying internal medical conditions. The Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS) is 
      recognized as a reliable screening tool, besides being endorsed by the 
      International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society to assess apathy in 
      patients with Parkinson's disease. Recently, the Italian version of this scale 
      (SAS-I) has been introduced. Furthermore, normative data have been provided on a 
      large sample of Italian healthy individuals. Here we present the official Italian 
      translation of the SAS, along with clarifications regarding its administration. 
      Also, we supply details concerning the scale's factorial structure, inter-item 
      conditional associations and item performance by using EFA, Network analysis, and 
      IRT modelling for polytomous items.

TI  - Development of a new patient-reported outcome measure for complex cryptoglandular 
      fistulas (20-Item complex cryptoglandular fistula questionnaire(™)): a 
      qualitative study.
PG  - 99
LID - 10.1186/s41687-024-00729-5 [doi]
LID - 99
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are limited tools to measure the burden of disease and 
      effectiveness of medical/surgical interventions in patients with cryptoglandular 
      fistulas. The aim of this study was to explore concepts that are relevant and 
      important to patients with complex cryptoglandular fistulas (CCF) and to develop 
      a patient-centred, disease-specific, patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) to 
      assess symptom burden and impacts of CCF. METHODS: A targeted literature review 
      was conducted, followed by one-to-one telephone interviews with five colorectal 
      surgeons (USA, n = 3; UK, n = 1; Spain, n = 1) and 20 US adult patients with CCF 
      to inform the development of a conceptual model and a CCF-specific PROM. The 
      targeted literature review informed the development of the preliminary conceptual 
      model and identified a PROM in the literature that was used as a reference to 
      generate the draft CCF-specific PROM. The colorectal surgeon interviews provided 
      insights on the experience of patients with CCF to refine the conceptual model, 
      formulate probing questions for use in patient interviews, and to develop the 
      draft CCF-specific PROM. Patients' descriptions of their experiences with 
      symptoms and the impacts on their lives and evaluation of the draft CCF-specific 
      PROM in concept elicitation and cognitive interviews were used to develop the 
      final conceptual model and final CCF-specific PROM. RESULTS: Ten symptoms (odour, 
      pain during bowel movement, abscess, post-operative pain, 
      discharge/drainage/leakage, anal/perianal pain, inflammation/swelling, skin 
      irritation, bleeding and itchiness) and 11 impacts (discomfort, inability to 
      exercise, embarrassment, difficulty sitting, worry about disease, adapted life to 
      maintain hygiene, negatively impacted social life/isolation, inability to perform 
      daily activities, reduced interest in sex, negatively impacted intimate 
      relationships and negatively impacted mood) were reported as most salient by 
      patients. The patient experience, clinician perspective, and literature review 
      provided input to item generation. Evaluation of relevance and patient 
      understanding through cognitive interviews with patients provided evidence for 
      the content validity of the new patient-reported outcome measure: the 20-item 
      Complex Cryptoglandular Fistula Questionnaire(™) (CCFQ-20(™)). CONCLUSION: The 
      CCFQ-20(™) is a new clinician-guided, patient-validated, disease-specific

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Depression and its components significantly impact dementia 
      prediction and severity, necessitating reliable objective measures for 
      quantification. METHODS: We investigated associations between emotion-based 
      speech measures (valence, arousal, and dominance) during picture descriptions and 
      depression dimensions derived from the geriatric depression scale (GDS, 
      dysphoria, withdrawal-apathy-vigor (WAV), anxiety, hopelessness, and subjective 
      memory complaint). RESULTS: Higher WAV was associated with more negative valence 
      (estimate = -0.133, p = 0.030). While interactions of apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 
      status with depression dimensions on emotional valence did not reach 
      significance, there was a trend for more negative valence with higher dysphoria 
      in those with at least one APOE4 allele (estimate = -0.404, p = 0.0846). 
      Associations were similar irrespective of dementia severity. DISCUSSION: Our 
      study underscores the potential utility of speech biomarkers in characterizing 
      depression dimensions. In future research, using emotionally charged stimuli may 
      enhance emotional measure elicitation. The role of APOE on the interaction of 
      speech markers and depression dimensions warrants further exploration with 
      greater sample sizes. HIGHLIGHTS: Participants reporting higher apathy used more 
      negative words to describe a neutral picture.Those with higher dysphoria and at 
      least one APOE4 allele also tended to use more negative words.Our results suggest 
      the potential use of speech biomarkers in characterizing depression dimensions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diabetes is increasing globally, highlighting the 
      importance of preventive healthcare. This study aimed to identify the diabetic 
      retinopathy (DR) screening rates and risk factors linked to DR screening 
      nonadherence in the Korean population through a nationally representative sample 
      survey. METHODS: Among the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
      database from 2016 to 2021, participants aged ≥ 40 years with diabetes were 
      included. The weighted estimate for nonadherence to DR screening within a year 
      was calculated. Risk factor analyses were conducted using univariate and 
      multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among the 3,717 participants, 1,109 
      (29.5%) underwent DR screening within the past year, and this national estimate 
      exhibited no statistically significant difference from 2016 to 2021 (P = 0.809). 
      Nonadherence to annual DR screening was associated with residing in rural areas, 
      age ≥ 80 years, low educational level, self-reported good health, absence of 
      ocular disease, current smoking, lack of exercise and dietary diabetes treatment, 
      and no activity limitation (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The recent DR screening 
      rate in Korea was relatively low. Factors associated with apathy and complacency 
      towards personal health were associated with the nonadherence to DR screening. 
      Educational interventions have the potential to enhance the annual screening rate 
      for diabetic patients.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Understanding the heterogeneity of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) 
      and associated brain abnormalities is essential for effective management and 
      treatment of dementia. OBJECTIVE: To identify dementia subtypes with distinct 
      functional connectivity associated with neuropsychiatric subsyndromes. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using data from the Open Access Series of Imaging 
      Studies-3 (OASIS-3; recruitment began in 2005) and Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging 
      Initiative (ADNI; recruitment began in 2004) databases, this cross-sectional 
      study analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, 
      clinical assessments, and neuropsychological measures of participants aged 42 to 
      95 years. The fMRI data were processed from July 2022 to February 2024, with 
      secondary analysis conducted from August 2022 to March 2024. Participants without 
      medical conditions or medical contraindications for MRI were recruited. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A multivariate sparse canonical correlation analysis was 
      conducted to identify functional connectivity-informed NPS subsyndromes, 
      including behavioral and anxiety subsyndromes. Subsequently, a clustering 
      analysis was performed on obtained latent connectivity profiles to reveal 
      neurophysiological subtypes, and differences in abnormal connectivity and 
      phenotypic profiles between subtypes were examined. RESULTS: Among 1098 
      participants in OASIS-3, 177 individuals who had fMRI and at least 1 NPS at 
      baseline were included (78 female [44.1%]; median [IQR] age, 72 [67-78] years) as 
      a discovery dataset. There were 2 neuropsychiatric subsyndromes identified: 
      behavioral (r = 0.22; P = .002; P for permutation = .007) and anxiety (r = 0.19; 
      P = .01; P for permutation = .006) subsyndromes from connectivity NPS-associated 
      latent features. The behavioral subsyndrome was characterized by connections 
      predominantly involving the default mode (within-network contribution by summed 
      correlation coefficients = 54) and somatomotor (within-network contribution = 58) 
      networks and NPSs involving nighttime behavior disturbance (R = -0.29; P < .001), 
      agitation (R = -0.28; P = .001), and apathy (R = -0.23; P = .007). The anxiety 
      subsyndrome mainly consisted of connections involving the visual network 
      (within-network contribution = 53) and anxiety-related NPSs (R = 0.36; P < .001). 
      By clustering individuals along these 2 subsyndrome-associated connectivity 
      latent features, 3 subtypes were found (subtype 1: 45 participants; subtype 2: 43 
      participants; subtype 3: 66 participants). Patients with dementia of subtype 3 
      exhibited similar brain connectivity and cognitive behavior patterns to those of 
      healthy individuals. However, patients with dementia of subtypes 1 and 2 had 
      different dysfunctional connectivity profiles involving the frontoparietal 
      control network (FPC) and somatomotor network (the difference by summed z values 
      was 230 within the SMN and 173 between the SMN and FPC for subtype 1 and 473 
      between the SMN and visual network for subtype 2) compared with those of healthy 
      individuals. These dysfunctional connectivity patterns were associated with 
      differences in baseline dementia severity (eg, the median [IQR] of the total 
      score of NPSs was 2 [2-7] for subtype 3 vs 6 [3-8] for subtype 1; P = .04 and 5.5 
      [3-11] for subtype 2; P = .03) and longitudinal progression of cognitive 
      impairment and behavioral dysfunction (eg, the overall interaction association 
      between time and subtypes to orientation was F = 4.88; P = .008; using the 
      time × subtype 3 interaction item as the reference level: β = 0.05; t = 2.6 for 
      time × subtype 2; P = .01). These findings were further validated using a 
      replication dataset of 193 participants (127 female [65.8%]; median [IQR] age, 74 
      [69-77] years) consisting of 154 newly released participants from OASIS-3 and 39 
      participants from ADNI. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings may provide a 
      novel framework to disentangle the neuropsychiatric and brain functional 
      heterogeneity of dementia, offering a promising avenue to improve clinical 
      management and facilitate the timely development of targeted interventions for 
      patients with dementia.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women worldwide. Breast 
      cancer patients experience significant distress relating to their diagnosis and 
      treatment. Managing this distress is critical for improving the lifespan and 
      quality of life of breast cancer survivors. This study aimed to assess the level 
      of distress in breast cancer survivors and analyze the variables that 
      significantly affect distress using machine learning techniques. A survey was 
      conducted with 641 adult breast cancer patients using the National Comprehensive 
      Cancer Network Distress Thermometer tool. Participants identified various factors 
      that caused distress. Five machine learning models were used to predict the 
      classification of patients into mild and severe distress groups. The survey 
      results indicated that 57.7% of the participants experienced severe distress. The 
      top-three best-performing models indicated that depression, dealing with a 
      partner, housing, work/school, and fatigue are the primary indicators. Among the 
      emotional problems, depression, fear, worry, loss of interest in regular 
      activities, and nervousness were determined as significant predictive factors. 
      Therefore, machine learning models can be effectively applied to determine 
      various factors influencing distress in breast cancer patients who have completed 
      primary treatment, thereby identifying breast cancer patients who are vulnerable 
      to distress in clinical settings.

TI  - Validation of the Italian version of the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive 
      Disorders in Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS) in an Italian Parkinson's 
      disease cohort.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Impulse control disorders (ICDs) frequently occur in Parkinson's 
      disease (PD), and an early identification is essential to prevent severe 
      psychosocial consequences. The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders 
      in Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS) has been developed to evaluate the 
      severity of ICDs along with a range of impulsive-compulsive behaviors (ICBs) in 
      PD; however, its Italian version has not yet been validated. METHODS: One hundred 
      consecutive outpatients with PD were administered an Italian version of the 
      QUIP-RS and a brief neuropsychological assessment to evaluate global cognitive 
      status and scales to measure depression, apathy and impulsive disorders. We 
      evaluated the internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity, and 
      factorial structure of QUIP-RS. We also explored the possible association between 
      QUIP-RS scores and clinical factors and dopaminergic medication. RESULTS: 
      Subsyndromal ICDs manifestations were observed in 54% of the patients, and one in 
      four (22%) reported two or more ICDs or related behaviors. The QUIP-RS 
      demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.806) and construct 
      validity, and its factorial structure reflected different ICDs and ICBs domains. 
      No association emerged between QUIP-RS scores and the clinical aspects of PD and 
      dopaminergic medication. CONCLUSION: We provided, for the first time, an Italian 
      translation of the QUIP-RS and demonstrated its feasibility in clinical and 
      research settings. Severity of ICDs was independent of clinical factors and 
      dopaminergic medication, underlining the need to adopt a broader perspective on 
      their etiopathology in PD.

TI  - A long and resilient life: the role of coping strategies and variability in their 
      use in lifespan among women.
PG  - 473-486
LID - 10.1080/10615806.2023.2288333 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Associations of stress-related coping strategies with lifespan among 
      the general population are understudied. Coping strategies are characterized as 
      being either adaptive or maladaptive, but it is unknown the degree to which 
      variability in tailoring their implementation to different contexts may influence 
      lifespan. METHOD: Women (N = 54,353; M(age )= 47) completed a validated coping 
      inventory and reported covariate information in 2001. Eight individual coping 
      strategies (e.g., Acceptance, Denial) were considered separately. Using a 
      standard deviation-based algorithm, participants were also classified as having 
      lower, moderate, or greater variability in their use of these strategies. Deaths 
      were ascertained until 2019. Accelerated failure time models estimated percent 
      changes and 95% confidence intervals (CI) in predicted lifespan associated with 
      coping predictors. RESULTS: In multivariable models, most adaptive and 
      maladaptive strategies were associated with longer and shorter lifespans, 
      respectively (e.g., per 1-SD increase: Active Coping = 4.09%, 95%CI = 1.83%, 
      6.41%; Behavioral Disengagement = -6.56%, 95%CI = -8.37%, -4.72%). Moderate and 
      greater (versus lower) variability levels were similarly and significantly 
      related to 8-10% longer lifespans. Associations were similar across age, 
      racial/ethnic, residential income, and marital status subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Findings confirm the adaptive and maladaptive nature of specific coping 
      strategies, and further suggest benefits from both moderate and greater 
      variability in their use for lifespan among women.

TI  - Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Association of Clinical and Neurocognitive 
      Factors With Apathy in Patients With Parkinson Disease.
PG  - e209301
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000209301 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A robust understanding of the natural history of 
      apathy in Parkinson disease (PD) is foundational for developing effective 
      clinical management tools. However, large longitudinal studies are lacking while 
      the literature is inconsistent about even cross-sectional associations. We aimed 
      to determine the longitudinal predictors of apathy development in a large cohort 
      of people with PD and its cross-sectional associations and trajectories over 
      time, using sophisticated Bayesian modeling techniques. METHODS: People with PD 
      followed up in the longitudinal New Zealand Parkinson's progression project were 
      included. Apathy was defined using the neuropsychiatric inventory subscale ≥4, 
      and analyses were also repeated using a less stringent cutoff of ≥1. Both MoCA 
      and comprehensive neuropsychological testing were used as appropriate to the 
      model. Depression was assessed using the hospital anxiety and depression scale. 
      Cross-sectional Bayesian regressions were conducted, and a multistate predictive 
      model was used to identify factors that predict the initial onset of apathy in 
      nonapathetic PD, while also accounting for the competing risk of death. The 
      relationship between apathy presence and mortality was also investigated. 
      RESULTS: Three hundred forty-six people with PD followed up for up to 14 years 
      across a total of 1,392 sessions were included. Apathy occurrence did not vary 
      significantly across the disease course (disease duration odds ratio [OR] = 0.55, 
      [95% CI 0.28-1.12], affecting approximately 11% or 22% of people at any time 
      depending on the NPI cutoff used. Its presence was associated with a 
      significantly higher risk of death after controlling for all other factors 
      (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.92 [1.50-5.66]). Lower cognition, higher depression 
      levels, and greater motor severity predicted apathy development in those without 
      motivational deficits (HR [cognition] = 0.66 [0.48-0.90], HR [depression] = 1.45 
      [1.04-2.02], HR [motor severity] = 1.37 [1.01-1.86]). Cognition and depression 
      were also associated with apathy cross-sectionally, along with male sex and 
      possibly lower dopaminergic therapy level, but apathy still occurred across the 
      full spectrum of each variable (OR [cognition] = 0.58 [0.44-0.76], OR 
      [depression] = 1.43 [1.04-1.97], OR [female sex] = 0.45 [0.22-0.92], and OR 
      [levodopa equivalent dose] = 0.78 [0.59-1.04]. DISCUSSION: Apathy occurs across 
      the PD time course and is associated with higher mortality. Depressive symptoms 
      and cognitive impairment in particular predict its future development in those 
      with normal motivation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The 25-item Hikikomori Questionnaire (HQ-25) is an instrument 
      developed to measure a condition characterized by extreme social withdrawal that 
      was first described in Japan. This study aimed to translate the HQ-25 into German 
      and validate the German version (HQ-25-G). METHODS: Translation was conducted 
      according to established guidelines. Validation was based on data from a quota 
      sample of individuals living in Germany, ranging from 18 to 74 years old 
      (representing the distribution of age, sex and federal state, n = 5000). Data 
      collection occurred during August and September 2023. We tested reliability, 
      construct validity and concurrent validity. Moreover, HQ-25 scores for key 
      sociodemographic group were reported. RESULTS: Internal reliability for the 
      HQ-25-G was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.93). We confirmed the original 
      three-factor model. Moreover, higher hikikomori levels were significantly 
      associated with more depressive symptoms (r = 0.50), more anxiety symptoms 
      (r = 0.45), higher loneliness levels (r = 0.56), higher levels of objective 
      social isolation (r = -0.47), higher levels of perceived social isolation 
      (r = 0.59) and a higher preference for solitude (r = 0.45). CONCLUSIONS: In a 
      large population-based sample (including younger adults, middle-aged adults and 
      older adults), the HQ-25-G version proves to be a psychometrically robust 
      instrument, which is useful for further exploring the phenomenon of hikikomori 
      within the German-speaking population.

TI  - Impaired facial emotion recognition in relation to social behaviours in de novo 
      Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 205-216
LID - 10.1111/jnp.12341 [doi]
AB  - Facial emotion recognition (FER) is a crucial component of social cognition and 
      is essential in social-interpersonal behaviour regulation. Although FER 
      impairment is well-established in advanced PD, data about FER at the time of 
      diagnosis and its relationship with social behavioural problems in daily life are 
      lacking. The aim was to examine FER at the time of PD diagnosis compared to a 
      matched healthy control (HC) group and to associate FER with indices of social 
      behavioural problems. In total, 142 de novo, treatment-naïve PD patients and 142 
      HC were included. FER was assessed by the Ekman 60 faces test (EFT). Behavioural 
      problems in PD patients were assessed using the Dysexecutive Questionnaire 
      (DEX-self and DEX-proxy) and the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-self). PD patients 
      had significantly lower EFT-total scores (p = .001) compared to HC, with worse 
      recognition of Disgust (p = .001) and Sadness (p = .016). Correlational analyses 
      yielded significant correlations between AES-self and both EFT-total (r(s) = .28) 
      and Fear (r(s) = .22). Significant negative correlations were found between 
      DEX-proxy and both EFT-total (r(s) = -.28) and Anger (r(s) = -.26). Analyses of 
      DEX-subscales showed that proxy ratings were significantly higher than 
      patient-ratings for the Social Conventions subscale (p = .047). This DEX-proxy 
      subscale had the strongest correlation with EFT-total (r(s) = -.29). Results show 
      that de novo PD patients already show impaired FER compared to HC. In addition, 
      lower FER is linked to self-reported apathy and proxy-reported social-behavioural 
      problems, especially concerning social conventions. These findings validate the 
      importance of the inclusion of social cognition measures in the 
      neuropsychological assessment even in early PD.

TI  - Prevalence and associated factors of depression among women with advanced pelvic 
      organ prolapse in Northwest Ethiopia: cross-sectional study.
PG  - 313
LID - 10.1186/s12905-024-03162-4 [doi]
LID - 313
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a symptom characterized by sadness, loss of interest or 
      pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, 
      feelings of tiredness and poor concentration. One of the most common mental 
      illnesses in the world and a major contributor to morbidity and mortality is 
      depression. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of 
      depression and the risk factors associated with it in women who had advanced 
      pelvic organ prolapse. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study was 
      conducted to determine depression among advanced pelvic organ prolapse women at 
      Gondar University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. All women who have advanced 
      pelvic organ prolapse were consecutively included till it reached a total of 367 
      participants over four months. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain the 
      sociodemographic characteristics, clinical characteristics and depression status 
      of the participants. Depression measures were obtained by using the Patient 
      Health Questionnaire tool, which is validated in the Ethiopian local language for 
      chronic illnesses including pelvic organ prolapse using a cut point of five and 
      above, which is considered to indicate depression. Women who screened positive 
      were linked to a psychiatric clinic for further evaluation and treatment. Data 
      was entered into a computer using Epi Info version 3.5.3 and then exported to 
      STATA version 14 for analysis. Multivariable logistic regressions were fitted and 
      odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals with a P value less than 0.05 were used 
      to identify statistically significant factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of 
      depression was found to be 47.1% (95% CI: 43-52%). Being rural (AOR = 4.8; CI: 
      1.11-16.32), having a history of divorce because of pelvic organ prolapse 
      (AOR = 5.5; CI: 1.85-16.32) and having a history of urinary symptoms (AOR = 3.1; 
      CI: 1.12-8.59) were found to be independently associated with depression. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depression among women with advanced pelvic organ 
      prolapse in this study is high as compared to other studies. Depression screening 
      strategies should be designed for the early identification and treatment of 
      depression among women with advanced pelvic organ prolapse.

TI  - Early Detection of Depression in Parkinson's Disease: Psychometrics and 
      Diagnostics of the Spanish Version of the Beck Depression Inventory.

LID - 10.1093/arclin/acad087 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Depression is one of the most disabling non-motor symptoms in 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) and requires proper diagnosis as it negatively impacts 
      patients' and their relatives quality of life. The present study aimed to examine 
      the psychometric and diagnostic properties of the Beck Depression Inventory-I 
      (BDI-I) in a Spanish PD cohort. METHOD: Consecutive PD outpatients completed the 
      Spanish version of the BDI-I and other questionnaires assessing anxiety and 
      apathy. Patients' caregivers completed the depression/dysphoria domain of the 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-D). The internal consistency, convergent and 
      divergent validity and the factorial structure of BDI-I were evaluated, and an 
      optimal cut-off was defined by means of the Youden index. RESULTS: The BDI-I 
      proved to have a good internal consistency and was underpinned by a 
      mono-component structure. Regarding construct validity, the BDI-I was 
      substantially related to anxiety and apathy measures in PD. Furthermore, the 
      BDI-I overall showed good accuracy with adequate sensitivity and specificity. The 
      optimal cut-off point was defined at 10. CONCLUSIONS: We provided evidence of the 
      psychometric and diagnostic properties of the Spanish version of the BDI-I as a 
      screening tool for depression in Spanish speaking PD patients, suggesting its 
      usefulness in clinical research and practice.

TI  - Prevalence of depression and associated symptoms among patients attending primary 
      healthcare facilities: a cross-sectional study in Nepal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a prevalent mental health condition worldwide but there 
      is limited data on its presentation and associated symptoms in primary care 
      settings in low- and middle-income countries like Nepal. This study aims to 
      assess the prevalence of depression, its hallmark and other associated symptoms 
      that meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) criteria in primary 
      healthcare facilities in Nepal. The collected information will be used to 
      determine the content of a mobile app-based clinical guidelines for better 
      detection and management of depression in primary care. METHODS: A total of 1,897 
      adult patients aged 18-91 (63.1% women) attending ten primary healthcare 
      facilities in Jhapa, a district in eastern Nepal, were recruited for the study 
      between August 2, 2021, and March 25, 2022. Trained research assistants conducted 
      face-to-face interviews in private spaces before the consultation with healthcare 
      providers. Depression symptoms, including hallmark symptoms, was assessed using 
      the validated Nepali version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). 
      RESULTS: One in seven (14.5%) individuals attending primary health care 
      facilities in Jhapa met the threshold for depression based on a validated cut-off 
      score ( > = 10) on the PHQ-9. The most commonly reported depressive symptoms were 
      loss of energy and sleep difficulties. Approximately 25.4% of women and 18.9% of 
      men endorsed at least one of the two hallmark symptoms on the PHQ-9. Using a 
      DSM-5 algorithm (at least one hallmark symptom and five or more total symptoms) 
      to score the PHQ-9, 6.3% of women and 4.3% of men met the criteria for 
      depression. The intra-class correlation coefficient for PHQ-9 total scores by 
      health facility as the unit of clustering was 0.01 (95% confidence interval, 
      0.00-0.04). CONCLUSION: Depression symptoms are common among people attending 
      primary healthcare facilities in Nepal. However, the most common symptoms are not 
      the two hallmark criteria. Use of total scores on a screening tool such as the 
      PHQ-9 risks overestimating the prevalence and generating false positive 
      diagnoses. Compared to using cut off scores on screening tools, training health 
      workers to first screen for hallmark criteria may increase the accuracy of 
      identification and lead to better allocation of treatment resources.

AB  - The Suicide Crisis Syndrome (SCS) describes a suicidal mental state marked by 
      entrapment, affective disturbance, loss of cognitive control, hyperarousal, and 
      social withdrawal that has predictive capacity for near-term suicidal behavior. 
      The Suicide Crisis Inventory-2 (SCI-2), a reliable clinical tool that assesses 
      SCS, lacks a short form for use in clinical settings which we sought to address 
      with statistical analysis. To address this need, a community sample of 10,357 
      participants responded to an anonymous survey after which predictive performance 
      for suicidal ideation (SI) and SI with preparatory behavior (SI-P) was measured 
      using logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting algorithms. 
      Four-fold cross-validation was used to split the dataset in 1,000 iterations. We 
      compared rankings to the SCI-Short Form to inform the short form of the SCI-2. 
      Logistic regression performed best in every analysis. The SI results were used to 
      build the SCI-2-Short Form (SCI-2-SF) utilizing the two top ranking items from 
      each SCS criterion. SHAP analysis of the SCI-2 resulted in meaningful rankings of 
      its items. The SCI-2-SF, derived from these rankings, will be tested for 
      predictive validity and utility in future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND:  The Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (ADLQ) focuses on 
      assessing the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) based on the 
      self-perception of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). A Brazilian 
      Portuguese version of the questionnaire is available (ADLQ-Brazil), and further 
      investigation is needed to fully assess its measurement properties. OBJECTIVE: 
       To investigate construct and concurrent validity of the telephone-based 
      administration of the ADLQ-Brazil with community individuals with PD. METHODS: 
       There were 50 adults with PD (mean age: 68 ± 9.5 years) invited to answer the 
      ADLQ-Brazil on two randomized occasions, face-to-face and by telephone, 7 to 10 
      days apart. Clinical-based measures including the Movement Disorder 
      Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, Timed 
      Up and Go Test, Nine Hole Peg Test, Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test, Apathy 
      Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, and Parkinson 
      Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire were applied during the first session, to 
      establish construct validity. RESULTS:  The total scores on the ADLQ-Brazil were 
      significantly associated with the clinical-based measures, thus providing 
      evidence of construct validity. No significant differences were observed between 
      the mean scores obtained with the face-to-face and telephone-based administration 
      of the questionnaire (95%CI = 0.997). A high level of agreement was found in the 
      total scores obtained between both applications of the ADLQ-Brazil 
      (95%CI = 0.994-0.998), and most of the individual items had, on average, moderate 
      agreement. CONCLUSION:  The findings provide psychometric support for the 
      ADLQ-Brazil as a telephone interview to assess the performance of ADLs in 
      individuals with PD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify whether pain and dementia-related behavior 
      are associated with different types of activities in nursing home residents, 
      controlled for dementia severity. DESIGN: Cross-sectional baseline data from the 
      multicomponent cluster randomized controlled COSMOS trial (acronym for 
      Communication, Systematic pain treatment, Medication review, Organization of 
      activities, and Safety). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 723 patients from 
      33 Norwegian nursing homes with 67 units (clusters). Participants aged ≥65 years, 
      with a life expectancy of >6 months, and with valid data on activity were 
      eligible for inclusion. METHODS: Activity was operationalized in time (hours per 
      week) and type (cognitive, social, physical, and no activity). Cognitive function 
      was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), pain with the 
      Mobilization-Observation-Behavior-Intensity-Dementia-2 Pain Scale (MOBID-2), and 
      behavior with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Nursing Home version (NPI-NH). 
      Analyses were performed using linear and logistic regression. Sensitivity 
      analyses for dementia severity were performed to account for effect modification. 
      RESULTS: A total of 289 participants were included (mean age 86.2 [SD 7.6]; 74% 
      female). A higher pain score was associated with less time spent on activity in 
      participants with severe dementia (estimate 0.897, P = .043). A higher score for 
      the NPI-NH mood cluster (depression and anxiety) was associated with a higher 
      likelihood of participation in cognitive activities (odds ratio [OR], 1.073; P = 
      .039). Apathy (OR, 0.884; P = .041) and lack of inhibition (OR, 0.904; P = .042) 
      were associated with a lower likelihood of participation in social activities as 
      well as no engagement in activities (apathy OR, 0.880; P = .042; lack of 
      inhibition OR, 0.894; P = .034). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Pain and 
      dementia-related behavior may influence the participation in activities in the 
      nursing home. There is an urgent need to investigate what type of activity 
      stimulates people in different stages of dementia.

TI  - Measurement of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the older adults with mild cognitive 
      impairment based on speech and facial expressions: a cross-sectional 
      observational study.
PG  - 828-837
LID - 10.1080/13607863.2023.2280913 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between speech and facial features with 
      depression, anxiety, and apathy in older adults with mild cognitive impairment 
      (MCI). METHODS: Speech and facial expressions of 319 MCI patients were digitally 
      recorded via audio and video recording software. Three of the most common 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) were evaluated by the Public Health 
      Questionnaire, General Anxiety Disorder, and Apathy Evaluation Scale, 
      respectively. Speech and facial features were extracted using the open-source 
      data analysis toolkits. Machine learning techniques were used to validate the 
      diagnostic power of extracted features. RESULTS: Different speech and facial 
      features were associated with specific NPS. Depression was associated with 
      spectral and temporal features, anxiety and apathy with frequency, energy, 
      spectral, and temporal features. Additionally, depression was associated with 
      facial features (action unit, AU) 10, 12, 15, 17, 25, anxiety with AU 10, 15, 17, 
      25, 26, 45, and apathy with AU 5, 26, 45. Significant differences in speech and 
      facial features were observed between males and females. Based on machine 
      learning models, the highest accuracy for detecting depression, anxiety, and 
      apathy reached 95.8%, 96.1%, and 83.3% for males, and 87.8%, 88.2%, and 88.6% for 
      females, respectively. CONCLUSION: Depression, anxiety, and apathy were 
      characterized by distinct speech and facial features. The machine learning model 
      developed in this study demonstrated good classification in detecting depression, 
      anxiety, and apathy. A combination of audio and video may provide objective 
      methods for the precise classification of these symptoms.

PG  - 243-262
LID - 10.1188/24.ONF.243-262 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate for differences in global, cancer-specific, and 
      cumulative life stress, as well as resilience and use of various coping 
      strategies among five groups (no depression or sleep disturbance, no depression 
      and moderate sleep disturbance, subsyndromal depression and very high sleep 
      disturbance, moderate depression and moderate sleep disturbance [Both Moderate]; 
      and high depression and very high sleep disturbance [Both High]). SAMPLE &AMP; 
      SETTING: Patients (N = 1,331) receiving chemotherapy were recruited from 
      outpatient oncology clinics. METHODS &AMP; VARIABLES: Measures of global, 
      cancer-specific, and cumulative life stress, resilience, and coping were 
      obtained. Differences were evaluated using parametric and nonparametric tests. 
      RESULTS: Global and cancer-specific stress scores increased as joint profiles 
      worsened. Both Moderate and Both High classes had cancer-specific stress scores 
      suggestive of post-traumatic stress. Both Moderate and Both High classes reported 
      higher occurrence rates for several stressful life events and higher use of 
      disengagement coping. Both Moderate and Both High classes had resilience scores 
      below the normative score for the United States. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: 
      Clinicians need to screen vulnerable patients for post-traumatic stress disorder 
      and implement interventions to reduce stress.

TI  - Patient-Reported Outcomes of Accelerated Aging: A Novel Approach to Investigate 
      Second Cancer Risk in Adolescent and Young Adult (18-39 Years) Cancer Survivors.
PG  - e526-e534
LID - 10.1093/oncolo/oyad307 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adolescent and young adult cancer survivors (AYAs, aged 18-39 years 
      at first diagnosis) have a higher second cancer risk. Accelerated aging is 
      hypothesized as underlying mechanism and has been described clinically by 6 
      indicators; fatigue, low quality of sleep, low mood, lack of motivation, 
      subjective memory complaints, and poor exercise tolerance. Using patient-reported 
      outcomes, we aimed to identify clusters of accelerated aging among AYA cancer 
      survivors and to investigate their association with second cancer development. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient, tumor, and treatment data were obtained from the 
      Netherlands Cancer Registry. Patient-reported clinical indicators and second 
      cancer data were obtained from the SURVivors (5-20 years) of cancer in AYAs 
      (SURVAYA) questionnaire study between 1999 and 2015. Latent class and 
      multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: In total, 
      n = 3734 AYA survivors with known second cancer status (n = 278 [7.4%] second 
      cancers) were included. Four latent clusters were identified and named based on 
      their clinical indicator features; (1) high accelerated aging (31.3%), (2) 
      intermediate accelerated aging without poor exercise tolerance (15.1%), (3) 
      intermediate accelerated aging without lack of motivation (27.4%), and (4) low 
      accelerated aging (26.2%). AYAs in the high accelerated aging cluster were more 
      likely to have second cancer (odds ratio: 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3) compared to the 
      low accelerated aging cluster. CONCLUSION: AYAs with a higher burden of 
      accelerated aging were more likely to develop a second cancer. Validation of the 
      clinical indicators and how to best capture them is needed to improve (early) 
      detection of AYAs at high risk of developing second cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Supervised exercise therapy (SET) for patients with intermittent 
      claudication (IC) can lower the risk of progression to chronic limb-threatening 
      ischemia and amputation, while preserving and restoring functional status. 
      Despite supporting evidence, it remains underutilized, and among those who 
      initiate programs, attrition rates are extremely high. We hypothesize that 
      socioeconomic factors may represent significant barriers to SET completion. 
      METHODS: Patients with IC referred to SET at a multi-hospital, single-institution 
      health care system (2018-2022) from a prospectively maintained database were 
      retrospectively analyzed. Our primary endpoint was SET program completion and 
      graduation, defined as completion of 36 sessions. Our secondary endpoints were 
      vascular intervention within 1 year of referral and change in ankle-brachial 
      index (ABI). Baseline demographics were assessed using standard statistical 
      methods. Predictors of SET graduation were analyzed using multivariable logistic 
      regression generating adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals 
      (CIs). Change in ABI was analyzed using t-test between subgroups. Reasons for 
      attrition were tabulated. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), metabolic 
      equivalent level, Vascular QOL, Duke Activity Status, and ABI were analyzed using 
      paired t-tests across the entire cohort. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients met 
      inclusion criteria: mean age 67.85 ± 10.69 years, 19 females (36.54%), mean 
      baseline ABI of 0.77 ± 0.16. The co-pays for 100% of patients were fully covered 
      by primary and secondary insurance plans. Twenty-one patients (40.38%) completed 
      SET. On multivariable analysis, residence in a ZIP code with median household 
      income <$47,000 (aOR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-0.76; P = .03) and higher body mass 
      index (aOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67-0.99; P = .04) were significant barriers to SET 
      graduation. There were no differences in ABI change or vascular intervention 
      within 1 year between graduates and non-graduates. Non-graduates reported 
      transportation challenges (25.00%), lack of motivation (20.83%), and 
      illness/functional limitation (20.83%) as primary reasons for SET attrition. 
      Metabolic Equivalent Level (P ≤ .01) and Duke Activity Status scores (P = .04) 
      were significantly greater after participating in a SET program. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Although SET participation improves lower extremity and functionality outcomes, 
      only 40% of referred patients completed therapy in our cohort. Our findings 
      suggest that both socioeconomic and functional factors influence the odds of 
      completing SET programs, indicating a need for holistic pre-referral assessment 
      to facilitate enhanced program accessibility for these populations.

AB  - The present study aimed to develop a precise and reliable measure of unsuccessful 
      disengagement among older adults, defined as involuntary withdrawal from societal 
      roles and norms due to familial or societal pressure, resulting in the transfer 
      of responsibilities to the younger generation. High scores on the Unsuccessful 
      Disengagement Aging Scale (UDAS) were indicative of a greater degree of 
      unsuccessful disengagement. The study was conducted in two parts: Study I 
      involved a purposive sample of 200 participants, whereas Study II involved a 
      purposive sample of 500 occupationally retired older adults aged between 65 and 
      85 years. The constructs of the study were measured using the UDAS, Depression 
      Anxiety and Stress Scale, and Identity and Experiences Scale. In Study I, the 
      UDAS was subjected to an Exploratory Factor Analysis, which revealed a clear 
      four-factor solution with high factor loadings and internally consistent factors. 
      This factor structure was confirmed through Confirmatory Factor Analysis in Study 
      II. Construct validity was established through the UDAS's significant positive 
      correlation with depression and non-significant correlation with assimilation 
      identity style. Furthermore, the mean UDAS score of older adults suffering from 
      chronic physical ailments such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiac problems, 
      hepatitis, ulcers, liver problems, arthritis, and joint pain was significantly 
      higher than that of healthy older adults, indicating the concurrent validity of 
      the UDAS in distinguishing between ill and healthy older adults. Overall, the 
      results indicated that the UDAS was a reliable and valid instrument for measuring 
      unsuccessful disengagement in older adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a common motivational deficit in neurodegenerative 
      diseases, but lacks a culturally sensitive tool accounting for ethnic Chinese 
      culture's impact on motivation initiation. This study developed and validated the 
      Geriatric Apathy Scale (GAS), comprehensively incorporating cultural nuances, 
      setting diagnostic cutoffs, and examining apathy's multi-dimensional aspects in a 
      neurodegenerative cohort. METHODS: The 16-item GAS was developed by considering 
      ethnic Chinese cultural characteristics and conducting a literature review. The 
      study involved 296 participants, comprising 113 with Parkinson's disease (PD), 66 
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 117 healthy controls (HC). All participants 
      completed the GAS, Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), Geriatric Depression Scale 
      (GDS-15), Mini-Mental State Examination, and Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). 
      RESULTS: The GAS showed good internal consistency (r = 0.862) and test-retest 
      reliability (r = 0.767). It correlated moderately with the AES (r = 0.639, 
      p < .001), weakly with GDS-15 (r = 0.166, p < .01), and negatively with ADLs 
      (r = -1.19, p < .05). Clinical diagnosis cutoff scores were identified at 15.5 
      for PD (sensitivity: 0.789; specificity: 0.693) and 12.5 for AD (sensitivity: 
      0.821; specificity: 0.632). Noteworthy disparities were observed in the Cognition 
      and Social Motivation dimension, with elevated severity in both PD and AD 
      compared to HC (p < .01). Interestingly, within-group comparisons revealed 
      greater apathy severity in the Cognition and Social Motivation dimension for PD 
      (p < .001) and AD (p = .001) versus Emotional Response and Expression and 
      Spontaneous Behavioral Activation. CONCLUSIONS: The GAS, a psychometrically 
      validated scale, assesses apathy in neurodegenerative populations, accounting for 
      ethnic Chinese culture's influence. It establishes clinical cutoff points and 
      explores the multi-dimensional nature of apathy.

TI  - Cultural adaptation and validation of the Sinhala version of the Frail 
      Non-disabled tool (FiND).

LID - 154
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty, a common geriatric syndrome of vulnerability, is associated 
      with a decline in health and function. The most problematic expression of 
      population ageing is associated with weakness, slowing, decreased energy, lower 
      activity and when severe, unintended weight loss. Frailty is not consciously 
      identified in clinical practice and is not widely studied in Sri Lanka. A 
      validated tool for screening frailty in a busy clinical setting is therefore much 
      needed. This study was done as a part of validating the Sinhala version of the 
      Frail Non-Disabled (S-FiND) tool. METHODS: The FiND tool was translated from 
      English to Sinhala by two translators, blinded to each other. They were combined 
      and translated back to the original language by two separate translators. After 
      verifying the content validity, unambiguity and clarity of items in a focused 
      group discussion, the pre-final version was piloted among 30 volunteers. After 
      assessing the psychometric properties of the pre-final version, the final version 
      was tested among 100 adults older than 65 years from the Colombo South Teaching 
      Hospital. The tool was compared with Fried's frailty phenotype taken as the gold 
      standard. RESULTS: Data were analysed for the agreement with the reference 
      standard, the Fried Phenotype. The mean (SD) age of subjects was 73.9 (7.8) 
      years. The overall time taken to fill out the questionnaire was 2 min. The 
      agreement (Kappa) between the S-FiND questionnaire and the Fried phenotype was 
      0.7 (P < 001). The sensitivity and specificity of FiND in detecting frailty were 
      92% and 74%, respectively. The agreements (Kappa) between the individual items of 
      S-Find: involuntary loss of weight/ more than 4.5 kg over one year, the feeling 
      of effort/ not getting going and level of physical activity, with the Fried 
      phenotype, were 0.28 (p = 0.001), 0.06 (p = 0.045) and 0.339 (p < 0.001). 
      respectively. When subjects were categorized frail and robust based on FiND, 
      frail subjects reported a higher incidence of falls (50%) during the previous 12 
      months, compared to those robust (13%) (p < 0.001 for Chi stat). CONCLUSION: The 
      S-FiND is a reliable, valid and well-received tool that can be used in detecting 
      the frailty of non-disabled Sinhala-speaking older adults.

TI  - Longitudinal associations of apathy and regional tau in mild cognitive impairment 
      and dementia: Findings from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
PG  - e12442

AB  - INTRODUCTION: It is important to study apathy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) to 
      better understand its underlying neurobiology and develop effective 
      interventions. In the current study, we sought to examine the relationships 
      between longitudinal apathy and regional tau burden in cognitively impaired older 
      adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. 
      METHODS: Three hundred and nineteen ADNI participants with mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) or AD dementia underwent flortaucipir (FTP) tau positron 
      emission tomography (PET) imaging and clinical assessment with the 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) annually. Longitudinal NPI Apathy (NPI-A) scores 
      were examined in relation to baseline tau PET signal in three a priori selected 
      regions implicated in AD and AD-related apathy (supramarginal gyrus, entorhinal 
      cortex [EC] and rostral anterior cingulate cortex [rACC]). Secondary models were 
      adjusted for global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination score) and cortical 
      amyloid (florbetapir PET). RESULTS: Higher baseline supramarginal gyrus and EC 
      tau burden were each significantly associated with greater NPI-A over time, while 
      rACC tau was associated with higher NPI-A but did not predict its trajectory over 
      time. These results were retained for supramarginal and EC tau after adjusting 
      models for global cognition and cortical amyloid. DISCUSSION: Our findings 
      suggest that baseline in vivo tau burden in parietal and temporal brain regions 
      affected in AD, and less so in a medial frontal region involved in motivational 
      control, is associated with increasing apathy over time in older adults with MCI 
      and AD dementia. Future work studying emergent apathy in relation to not only 
      core AD pathology but also circuit level dysfunction may provide additional 
      insight into the neurobiology of apathy in AD and opportunities for intervention. 
      HIGHLIGHTS: Tau (Flortaucipir PET) in regions implicated in AD was associated 
      with increasing apathy over timeCortical amyloid was also found to be a robust 
      predictor of the trajectory of apathyEvidence of synergy between regional tau and 
      amyloid in overall higher levels of apathy.

TI  - Stratifying Risk for Cognitive Decline in Older Adult Populations using the 
      Geriatric Depression Scale.
LID - 172 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Late-life psychological symptoms in older adults such as depression 
      and apathy have been increasingly associated with increased risk of cognitive and 
      functional decline. The goal of this study was to conduct a confirmatory factor 
      analysis of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), pooling 3 unique cohorts of 
      older adults to 1) develop a novel measurement model that distinguishes apathy 
      from other domains of depression including dysphoria and cognitive concern and 2) 
      evaluate if the measurement model distinguishes older adult populations with 
      varied risk for cognitive decline. METHODS: We pooled the baseline waves of three 
      older adult cohorts (N=1421). With the aim of partitioning apathy from other 
      constructs that compose the GDS and with a PCA suggesting 3-component solution, 
      we then conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using lavaan and less R. 
      RESULTS: CFA yielded 3 factors: dysphoria, apathy, and cognitive concern. All the 
      dysphoria, apathy, and cognitive concern factors showed acceptable 
      unidimensionality with α=.76, .59, and .54, respectively. The Cognitive Risk 
      Primary Care cohort had significantly higher mean dysphoria, apathy and cognitive 
      concern scales. CONCLUSIONS: This culturally, linguistically, and educationally 
      diverse sample population yielded factors with acceptable reliability and good 
      face validity. This strategy has resulted in a generalizable measurement model to 
      identify people at risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. In 
      particular, the apathy scale score can be used to identify older adults at risk 
      for cognitive and functional decline across research and clinical settings.

      mild cognitive impairment].
PG  - 49-55

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of mild behavioral impairment (MBI ) in 
      elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI ), refine diagnostic 
      criteria, and characterize the identified neuropsychiatric symptoms. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: Sixty-three individuals over 50 years of age (median 72 [68; 77]) with 
      MCI underwent psychiatric and psychometric assessments using clinical and 
      psychopathological methods and scales. Statistical analysis was conducted to 
      evaluate intergroup differences, ROC-analysis with calculation of the area under 
      the curve (AUC) was performed, and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MBI 
      diagnosis were determined for MBI-C. RESULTS: The prevalence of MBI using only 
      ISTAART research criteria was 65%. An optimal diagnostic cut point for the MBI-C 
      scale with the highest AUC (0.793), at 10 points, was identified. Upon a 
      comprehensive assessment of MBI using criteria and optimal cut point values from 
      the MBI-C scale, the prevalence was 33% (median 16 [14; 20]). Patients with 
      MBI+MCI and MCI only did not significantly differ in MMSE and MoCA test results. 
      Significant intergroup differences were observed in the severity of symptoms such 
      as apathy (p<0.001), depression and anxiety (p<0.001), agitation and impulsivity 
      (p<0.001), social behavioral disturbances (p=0.009), and subsyndromal psychotic 
      symptoms (p<0.001). The most common symptoms were related to impulse control 
      deficits, irritability, agitation, depression, anxiety, and apathy, while less 
      common symptoms were associated with social behavioral disturbances and 
      subsyndromal psychotic symptoms. CONCLUSION: Novel data on the diagnostic 
      features of MBI in elderly patients with MCI in the Russian-speaking population 
      are presented. An optimal diagnostic cut point for the MBI-C scale in a sample of 
      patients from specialized clinics for comprehensive use with commonly accepted 
      criteria was determined. Further research is needed to adapt and validate the 
      MBI-C scale and provide prognostic evaluation of MBI in the context of MCI 
      progression to dementia.

TI  - Relationship between Loneliness and Mild Behavioral Impairment: Validation of the 
      Japanese Version of the MBI Checklist and a Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - 1951-1960
LID - 10.3233/JAD-230923 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) and loneliness are associated with 
      cognitive decline and an increased risk of dementia. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to 
      examine the validity of the Japanese version of the MBI checklist (MBI-C) and 
      investigate the relationship between loneliness and MBI. METHODS: The 
      participants in this cross-sectional study included 5 cognitively normal persons 
      and 75 persons with mild cognitive impairment. MBI-C and the revised University 
      of California at Los Angeles loneliness scale (LS) were used to assess MBI and 
      loneliness, respectively. Diagnostic performance of MBI-C was examined using 
      receiver operating characteristic analysis. The relationship between MBI-C and LS 
      was examined using multiple linear regression in 67 subjects who were assessed 
      with both scales, with MBI-C total or domain score as the dependent variable and 
      LS as the independent variable, adjusted for age, gender, living situation, 
      presence of visual and hearing impairment, and Mini-Mental State Examination 
      score. RESULTS: Per the Youden index, in this mostly MCI sample, the optimal 
      MBI-C cut-off score was 5.5 with sensitivity 0.917 and specificity 0.949. In 
      multiple linear regression analysis, LS score was detected as a significant 
      predictor of MBI-C total scores, and MBI-C decreased motivation, affective 
      dysregulation, and abnormal thought and perception scores. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      caregiver-rated Japanese MBI-C has excellent diagnostic performance. Loneliness 
      is associated with a greater MBI burden, especially in the decreased motivation, 
      affective dysregulation, and abnormal thought and perception domains. 
      Interventions for loneliness in older people may have the potential to improve 
      MBI.

TI  - Validation of the Portuguese version of the supportive care needs survey 
      short-form questionnaire (SCNS-SF34-Pt) and the breast cancer supplementary 
      module (SCNS-BR8-Pt).
PG  - 486-505
LID - 10.1080/07347332.2023.2282015 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test the psychometric properties of the Portuguese 
      Supportive Care Needs Survey-Short Form-34 (SCNS-SF34-Pt) and its breast 
      cancer-specific complementary module (SCNS-BR8-Pt). A further aim was to 
      characterize Portuguese Breast Cancer Survivors' (BCS) unmet supportive care 
      needs, using these measures. METHODS: A convenient sample of BCS was recruited 
      from five hospitals in Portugal and invited to complete SCNS-SF34-Pt and 
      SCNS-BR8-Pt, EORTCQLQC30 and QLQBR23, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and the 
      Patient Health-Questionnaire. The validity (i.e. convergent, discriminant and 
      convergent validity) and reliability of SCNS-SF34-Pt and SCNS-BR8-Pt were 
      statistically evaluated. BCS' unmet supportive care needs were descriptively 
      assessed. FINDINGS: 336 BCS participated in the study. A four-factor solution was 
      produced for SCNS-SF34-Pt. This solution included the Physical and daily living 
      needs, Psychological needs, Sexuality needs, and Health system, information, and 
      patient support needs dimensions (73% of the total variance; Cronbach's alpha=.82 
      to .97). SCNS-SF34-Pt demonstrated good convergent validity. It could also 
      discriminate between known-groups regarding age, disease staging, treatment 
      performed, and ECOG performance status. SCNS-BR8-Pt revealed a single-factor 
      structure (62% of the total variance; Cronbach's alpha=.91).Portuguese BCS' most 
      prevalent unmet supportive care needs were associated with the Psychological, and 
      Physical and daily living domains. Fear of cancer spreading, the inability to do 
      things as usual, and lack of energy/tiredness were perceived as issues requiring 
      further supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: SCNS-SF34-Pt and the SCNS-BR8-Pt are valid 
      and reliable tools to assess Portuguese BCS' unmet supportive care needs. Fear of 
      cancer spreading and lack of energy/tiredness concerns should be a target of 
      supportive care services.

TI  - Symptom Burden of Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Attending 
      the Westmead Breathlessness Service: Prevalence, Associations, and Sex-Related 
      Differences.
PG  - 2825-2837
LID - 10.2147/COPD.S433541 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disease 
      resulting in a range of symptoms including breathlessness. "Symptom burden" 
      describes the severity and impact of multiple symptoms in an individual and is 
      best quantified using validated symptom instruments but is not routinely measured 
      in clinical practice. Therefore, we wanted to assess overall symptom burden in 
      patients with moderate-to-severe COPD and find associated independent predictors. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single-centre cross-sectional study of patients with COPD 
      who attended the Westmead Breathlessness Service between March 2017 and May 2022 
      was conducted. We obtained baseline demographic data, lung function, assessed 
      quality of life (CAT), anxiety/depression (HADS), and measured symptom burden 
      (CMSAS). We compared variables between men and women using unpaired t tests or 
      Mann-Whitney tests for continuous variables, and Fisher's exact tests for 
      categorical variables. We used multiple regression to look for independent 
      predictors of overall symptom burden. Data were analysed using Stata/IC 15.1. 
      RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients with COPD, mean age 72.6 years, 55% male, mean 
      FEV(1) 32% predicted, reported an average of 8.9 symptoms including 6.9 physical 
      and 1.6 psychological symptoms. The most common physical symptoms were shortness 
      of breath (100%) and lack of energy (80%), and the most common psychological 
      symptoms were worrying (65%) and feeling anxious (61%). Median CMSAS total score 
      was higher in women than men (1.34 versus 1.04, respectively; p=0.03) with more 
      women experiencing nervousness (p=0.011) and anxiety (p=0.005). Female sex 
      (p=0.003), HADS-Anxiety (p=0.0001), and HADS-Depression (p=0.0001) were 
      independently associated with total CMSAS score in a multiple linear regression 
      model and explained 63% of total CMSAS variability. CONCLUSION: Very high 
      physical and psychological symptom burden exists among patients with severe COPD. 
      Anxiety, depression, and female sex were independently associated with increasing 
      symptom burden. Identifying and understanding sex differences for COPD symptoms, 
      and interventions targeting anxiety and depression may help to reduce overall 
      symptom burden within this population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke survivors rate longer-term (> 2 years) psychological recovery 
      as their top priority, but data on how frequently psychological consequences 
      occur is lacking. Prevalence of cognitive impairment, depression/anxiety, 
      fatigue, apathy and related psychological outcomes, and whether rates are stable 
      in long-term stroke, is unknown. METHODS: N = 105 long-term stroke survivors (M 
      [SD] age = 72.92 [13.01]; M [SD] acute NIH Stroke Severity Score = 7.39 [6.25]; 
      59.0% Male; M [SD] years post-stroke = 4.57 [2.12]) were recruited (potential 
      N = 208). Participants completed 3 remote assessments, including a comprehensive 
      set of standardized cognitive neuropsychological tests comprising domains of 
      memory, attention, language, and executive function, and questionnaires on 
      emotional distress, fatigue, apathy and other psychological outcomes. Ninety 
      participants were re-assessed one year later. Stability of outcomes was assessed 
      by Cohen's d effect size estimates and percent Minimal Clinically Important 
      Difference changes between time points. RESULTS: On the Montreal Cognitive 
      Assessment 65.3% scored < 26. On the Oxford Cognitive Screen 45.9% had at least 
      one cognitive impairment. Attention (27.1%) and executive function (40%) were 
      most frequently impaired. 23.5% and 22.5% had elevated depression/anxiety 
      respectively. Fatigue (51.4%) and apathy (40.5%) rates remained high, comparable 
      to estimates in the first-year post-stroke. Attention (d = -0.12; 85.8% stable) 
      and depression (d = 0.09, 77.1% stable) were the most stable outcomes. Following 
      alpha-adjustments, only perceptuomotor abilities (d = 0.69; 40.4% decline) and 
      fatigue (d = -0.33; 45.3% decline) worsened over one year. Cognitive impairment, 
      depression/anxiety, fatigue and apathy all correlated with worse quality of life. 
      CONCLUSION: Nearly half of participants > 2 years post-event exhibited 
      psychological difficulties including domains of cognition, mood, and fatigue, 
      which impact long-term quality of life. Stroke is a chronic condition with highly 
      prevalent psychological needs, which require monitoring and intervention 
      development.

TI  - Is the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire a Valid Measure in Older 
      People?
LID - 10.3390/healthcare11202707 [doi]
LID - 2707
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the widely recognized benefits of physical activity for 
      preventing physical and cognitive decline during aging, global estimates indicate 
      that most older adults do not achieve the recommended amount of physical activity 
      due to a lack of motivation. The current research examined the validity and 
      psychometric properties of the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire 
      (BREQ-3) among older adults. Based on Self-Determination Theory (SDT), the BREQ-3 
      stands out as one of the most extensively utilized tools among exercise 
      motivation studies. METHODS: A sample of older adults (N = 383; M age = 73.2 
      years, SD age = 7.2) completed the BREQ-3 and the Godin-Shepard Leisure-Time 
      Physical Activity Questionnaire (GSLTPAQ). RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses 
      confirmed the six-factor structure postulated by SDT, showing good fit indices 
      (CFI= 0.95; RMSEA = 0.05; SRMR = 0.04) and supporting the full measurement 
      invariance of the scale across sex and age groups (65 to 74 years; over 75 
      years). The construct and criterion validity of the BREQ-3 was upheld through the 
      latent correlations between its subscales and their correlations with the 
      GSLTPAQ. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated for the first time the effectiveness of the 
      BREQ-3 in assessing all forms of behavioral regulation proposed by SDT in older 
      adults, suggesting that older adults similarly interpreted the items across sex 
      and age groups.

PG  - 1527-1533
LID - 10.25122/jml-2023-0244 [doi]
AB  - Environmental hazards and/or pandemics may push humans to use different 
      protective methods to maintain their well-being. This study aimed to identify 
      populations vulnerable to psychometric challenges and fatigue during the 
      Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Kazakhstan. A total of 1,592 
      participants were recruited and asked to complete the Multidimensional Fatigue 
      Inventory-20 (MFI-20). Participants were classified according to gender and age. 
      Data were analyzed using the Chi-square test (x2) and MedCalc to detect the odds 
      of MFI-scales with a score ≥12 in women compared to men. Young women had 
      significantly higher odds (OR) of reduced activity (OR 2.4, p<0.0001), physical 
      (OR 2.5, p<0.0001), and mental fatigue (OR 3.4, p<0.0001) than young men. 
      Middle-aged women had significantly higher odds of general fatigue (OR 2.1; 
      p<0.0001), reduced motivation (OR 2.1, p<0.0001), physical (OR 2.1, p<0.0001), 
      and mental fatigue (OR 1.9, p<0.0001) than did middle-aged men. Elderly women had 
      significantly higher odds of general fatigue (OR 3.6, p<0.0001), reduced 
      motivation (OR 3.5, p<0.0001), and physical fatigue (OR 3.5, p<0.0001) than men 
      in the same age category. The study highlights that women were more susceptible, 
      with significantly increased odds of experiencing various aspects of fatigue 
      syndrome compared to men during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kazakhstan. Therefore, 
      it is necessary to investigate individual behavioral changes to help identify 
      vulnerable populations and provide relevant evidence for developing protocols and 
      guidelines during pandemics and/or outbreaks.

TI  - Developing a machine learning model for detecting depression, anxiety, and apathy 
      in older adults with mild cognitive impairment using speech and facial 
      expressions: A cross-sectional observational study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression, anxiety, and apathy are highly prevalent in older people 
      with preclinical dementia and mild cognitive impairment. These symptoms have also 
      proven valuable in predicting the progression from mild cognitive impairment to 
      dementia, enabling a timely diagnosis and treatment. However, objective and 
      reliable indicators to detect and distinguish depression, anxiety, and apathy are 
      relatively scarce. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a machine learning 
      model to detect and distinguish depression, anxiety, and apathy based on speech 
      and facial expressions. DESIGN: An observational, cross-sectional study design. 
      SETTING(S): The memory outpatient department of a tertiary hospital. 
      PARTICIPANTS: 319 older adults diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. METHODS: 
      Depression, anxiety, and apathy were evaluated by the Public Health 
      Questionnaire, General Anxiety Disorder, and Apathy Evaluation Scale, 
      respectively. Speech and facial expressions of older adults with mild cognitive 
      impairment were digitally captured using audio and video recording software. 
      Open-source data analysis toolkits were utilized to extract speech, facial, and 
      text features. The multiclass classification was used to develop classification 
      models, and shapely additive explanations were used to explain the contribution 
      of each feature within the model. RESULTS: The random forest method was used to 
      develop a multiclass emotion classification model, which performed well in 
      classifying emotions with a weighted-average F1 score of 96.6 %. The model also 
      demonstrated high accuracy, precision, and recall, with 87.4 %, 86.6 %, and 
      87.6 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning model developed in this 
      study demonstrated strong classification performance in detecting and 
      differentiating depression, anxiety, and apathy. This innovative approach 
      combines text, audio, and video to provide objective methods for precise 
      classification and remote monitoring of these symptoms in nursing practice. 
      REGISTRATION: This study was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry 
      (registration number: ChiCTR1900023892; registration date: June 19th, 2019).

TI  - Potential impacts of Russo-Ukraine conflict and its psychological consequences 
      among Ukrainian adults: the post-COVID-19 era.
PG  - 1280423

LID - 1280423
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since February 2022, the nation of Ukraine has become entangled in an 
      escalating conflict that erupted after coronavirus outbreak fostering a situation 
      of indeterminacy and precariousness, which adversely affected several facets, 
      especially psychological well-being. However, there is a lack of empirical 
      evidence on the psychological well-being of Ukrainians during the Russo-Ukraine 
      war, as well as their coping strategies in response to the war's repercussions. 
      Consequently, this investigation endeavors to explore the prevalence of symptoms 
      associated with depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia and to correlate these 
      symptoms with Ukrainians' effective coping mechanisms during the ongoing war. 
      METHODS: An online survey was administered in Ukraine from June to August 2022 
      due to the ongoing Russo-Ukraine conflict. The survey employed a quota sampling 
      technique, targeting 2,664 individuals (≥18 years). Out of the total sample, 
      1,833 valid responses were obtained, yielding a response rate of 68. 81%. 
      Depression, anxiety, and stress were measured using the depression, anxiety, and 
      stress scale-21 (DASS-21), while the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) was 
      utilized to evaluate insomnia symptoms. In addition, Brief-COPE was adopted to 
      evaluate the coping mechanisms of the selected study participants. RESULTS: Of 
      1,833 Ukrainian adults, 60.5% had symptoms of stress; 62.4% of them reported 
      symptoms of anxiety; and 58.2% reported symptoms of depression. Symptom criteria 
      for insomnia were found in about 21.8% of the study sample. The factors of sex, 
      living area, area occupied by Russian forces, and having older adults and 
      children in the house were statistically significant with symptoms of depression, 
      anxiety, stress, and insomnia. The productive coping strategies of 
      self-distraction, using instrumental support, planning, and behavioral 
      disengagement, were observed as statistically significant with four psychological 
      constructs. CONCLUSION: The study outcomes highlight a substantial prevalence of 
      symptoms related to depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia attributed to the 
      accumulated consequences of ongoing conflict and the COVID-19 outbreak. The 
      aforementioned findings emphasize the imperative of providing healthcare services 
      and facilitating effective coping strategies among Ukrainians amid the ongoing 
      war.

TI  - Empathic Accuracy Task: Indian Adaptation and Validation.
PG  - 486-495
LID - 10.1177/02537176221141583 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Empathic Accuracy Task (EAT) is an objective measure to assess 
      empathic accuracy. Due to the variability in the number and linked emotions of 
      the narrated events, we adapted EAT for the Indian sociocultural setting as 
      Indian EAT (I-EAT). METHODS: Eight videos were adapted in three languages 
      (English, Hindi, and Kannada), narrating emotional events with a uniform 
      representation of age groups, different emotions, and sex. The adapted I-EAT was 
      then validated by cross-sectional comparison with different tests similar to EAT 
      and those that assessed concepts different from or similar to empathy, in 29 
      healthy young adults, 23 healthy older adults (aged ≥60 years) along with 
      clinical groups of 15 young people with depression, 15 older people with 
      depression, and 15 young people with schizophrenia. RESULTS: We selected eight 
      videos with good content validity and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 
      0.73. We obtained satisfactory concurrent validity of the EAT scores with the 
      self-reported empathic assessments using the Questionnaire of Cognitive and 
      Affective Empathy (Cognitive empathy score = 0.29, p = .034; Total score = 0.29, 
      p = .035) and Interpersonal Reactivity Index (Empathic concern score = 0.45, p = 
      .001). Good divergent validity was revealed in the high inverse correlation 
      recorded with the Apathy Evaluation Scale ( = -0.67, p < .001). I-EAT did not 
      correlate significantly with measures of social cognition. Known-groups validity 
      was adequate in young adults with the significantly lower EAT scores (Cohen's d: 
      0.77 to 1.15) in the Schizophrenia group and higher EAT-N scores (Cohen's d: 
      0.51) in the Depression group, compared to the Healthy group. The Healthy group 
      of the geriatric population also achieved significantly higher EAT scores 
      (Cohen's d: 0.71 to 0.85) than the Depression group. CONCLUSION: With a good 
      validity and internal consistency, I-EAT can be used in the Indian population to 
      assess empathic accuracy without compromising performance of the original EAT.

      without dementia.
PG  - e6003
LID - 10.1002/gps.6003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C) was developed to 
      assess neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and to identify mild behavioral impairment 
      (MBI). This study validated the Taiwanese version of the MBI-C and examined its 
      association of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). METHODS: We recruited 242 
      older individuals without dementia (129 amnestic mild cognitive impairment, 113 
      cognitively normal). Their family completed the MBI-C, the Neuropsychiatric 
      Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), and instrumental activities of daily living 
      scale. Participants completed the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), the 
      Mini-Mental State Examination, the 12-item word recall test, the category verbal 
      fluency test and the EuroQol 5 dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D). Cronbach's α was 
      used to evaluate the internal consistency of the MBI-C. Linear regression models 
      were used to examined the association between MBI-C score and HR-QoL assessed 
      using ED-5D. RESULTS: The prevalence of MBI was 12% of all participants. 
      Cronbach's α of the MBI-C was 0.893. The optimal cut-off point of MBI-C was 7.5 
      for identifying MBI, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 85%. The MBI-C 
      total score (β = -0.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.02 to -0.01, 
      p < 0.001), MBI-C subdomain of decreased motivation (β = -0.04, 95% CI = -0.05 to 
      -0.02, p < 0.001) and emotional dysregulation (β = -0.02, 95% CI = -0.04 to 
      -0.004, p = 0.01) were factors related to EQ-5D index scores. CONCLUSION: Among 
      older adults without dementia, the Taiwanese version of the MBI-C has good 
      reliability and validity for detecting MBI. The total and subdomains of MBI-C 
      were associated with decreased HR-QoL among individuals without dementia.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to (1) validate the Thai version of 
      the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) as a screening tool for 
      behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and (2) examine the 
      relationship between cognitive performance and BPSD in an elderly population with 
      amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT). 
      METHODS: One hundred and twenty participants, comprising 80 aMCI and 40 DAT 
      patients, and their respective caregivers were included in the study. 
      Participants completed the NPI-Q and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) within 
      2 weeks of each other and cognitive performance was primarily assessed using the 
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). RESULTS: The Thai NPI-Q had good validity 
      and reliability. Pure exploratory bifactor analysis revealed that a general 
      factor and a single-group factor (with high loadings on delusions, 
      hallucinations, apathy, and appetite) underpinned the NPI-Q domains. Significant 
      negative correlations between the MoCA total score and the general and 
      single-group NPI-Q scores were found in all subjects (aMCI + DAT combined) and 
      DAT alone, but not in aMCI. Cluster analysis allocated subjects with BPSD (10% of 
      aMCI and 50% of DAT participants) into a distinct "DAT + BPSD" class. CONCLUSION: 
      The NPI-Q is an appropriate instrument for assessing BPSD and the total score is 
      largely predicted by cognitive deficits. It is plausible that aMCI subjects with 
      severe NPI-Q symptoms (10% of our sample) may have a poorer prognosis and 
      constitute a subgroup of aMCI patients who will likely convert into probable 
      dementia.

TI  - Dissociable effects of dopaminergic medications on depression symptom dimensions 
      in Parkinson's disease.
LID - 2023.06.30.23292073 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2023.06.30.23292073 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression in Parkinson's disease (PD) is common, disabling and 
      responds poorly to standard antidepressant medication. Motivational symptoms of 
      depression, such as apathy and anhedonia, are particularly prevalent in 
      depression in PD and predict poor response to antidepressant treatment. Loss of 
      dopaminergic innervation of the striatum is associated with emergence of 
      motivational symptoms in PD, and mood fluctuations correlate with dopamine 
      availability. Accordingly, optimising dopaminergic treatment for PD can improve 
      depressive symptoms, and dopamine agonists have shown promising effects in 
      improving apathy. However, the differential effect of antiparkinsonian medication 
      on symptom dimensions of depression is not known. AIMS: We hypothesised that 
      there would be dissociable effects of dopaminergic medications on different 
      depression symptom dimensions. We predicted that dopaminergic medication would 
      specifically improve motivational symptoms, but not other symptoms, of 
      depression. We also hypothesised that antidepressant effects of dopaminergic 
      medications with mechanisms of action reliant on pre-synaptic dopamine neuron 
      integrity would attenuate as pre-synaptic dopaminergic neurodegeneration 
      progresses. METHODS: We analysed data from a longitudinal study of 412 newly 
      diagnosed PD patients followed over five years in the Parkinson's Progression 
      Markers Initiative cohort. Medication state for individual classes of Parkinson's 
      medications was recorded annually. Previously validated "motivation" and 
      "depression" dimensions were derived from the 15-item geriatric depression scale. 
      Dopaminergic neurodegeneration was measured using repeated striatal dopamine 
      transporter (DAT) imaging. RESULTS: Linear mixed-effects modelling was performed 
      across all simultaneously acquired data points. Dopamine agonist use was 
      associated with relatively fewer motivation symptoms as time progressed 
      (interaction: β=-0.07, 95%CI [-0.13,-0.01], p=0.015) but had no effect on the 
      depression symptom dimension (p=0.6). In contrast, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) 
      inhibitor use was associated with relatively fewer depression symptoms across all 
      years (β=-0.41, 95%CI [-0.81,-0.01], p=0.047). No associations were observed 
      between either depression or motivation symptoms and levodopa or amantadine use. 
      There was a significant interaction between striatal DAT binding and MAO-B 
      inhibitor use on motivation symptoms: MAO-B inhibitor use was associated with 
      lower motivation symptoms in patients with higher striatal DAT binding 
      (interaction: β=-0.24, 95%CI [-0.43, -0.05], p=0.012). No other medication 
      effects were moderated by striatal DAT binding measures. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      identified dissociable associations between dopaminergic medications and 
      different dimensions of depression in PD. Dopamine agonists may be effective for 
      treatment of motivational symptoms of depression. In contrast, MAO-B inhibitors 
      may improve both depressive and motivation symptoms, albeit the latter effect 
      appears to be attenuated in patients with more severe striatal dopaminergic 
      neurodegeneration, which may be a consequence of dependence on pre-synaptic 
      dopaminergic neuron integrity.

TI  - Mental health symptoms and coping strategies among Ukrainians during the 
      Russia-Ukraine war in March 2022.
PG  - 957-966

AB  - CONTEXT: The Russian attack on Ukraine has been ongoing since February 24, 2022. 
      Nevertheless, no research has documented the mental health of Ukrainians during 
      the biggest land war in Europe after the Second World War, or how Ukrainians cope 
      with the impact of the war. OBJECTIVES: To provide the prevalence rates of 
      symptoms of psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia; and to 
      link them with Ukrainians' productive coping strategies during the war. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Online survey conducted in Ukraine during the initial 
      period of the Russian invasion (March 19-31, 2022), using a quota sampling 
      method, of 1,400 Ukrainians aged 18 years or older, with a total of 801 valid 
      responses for a response rate of 57.2%. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Psychological 
      distress assessed by the Kessler Psychological Distress scale (K6); anxiety 
      assessed by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2) scale; depression assessed by 
      Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2); insomnia assessed by Insomnia Severity 
      Index-4 (ISI-4); modes of coping assessed by Brief COPE. RESULTS: Of 801 
      Ukrainian adults, 52.7% had symptoms of psychological distress (mean = 13.3 
      [SD = 4.9]); 54.1% of them reported symptoms of anxiety (mean = 2.9 [SD = 1.7]); 
      46.8% reported symptoms of depression (mean = 2.6 [SD = 1.6]). Symptom criteria 
      for insomnia were met by 97 respondents (12.1%) (mean = 10.4 [SD = 4.2]). 
      Demographic variables (including gender, living in an urban area, having children 
      or elderly persons in the household, living in an area occupied by Russian 
      forces) were associated with symptoms of distress, anxiety, depression, and 
      insomnia. The productive coping strategies of using instrumental support, 
      behavioral disengagement, self-distraction, and planning were significantly 
      associated with mental health symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence rates of symptoms 
      of psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia were high. These 
      findings underscore the need for healthcare and productive coping strategies for 
      Ukrainians during the war.

TI  - Mid- and Late-Life Physical Activity and Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in 
      Dementia-Free Older Adults: Mayo Clinic Study of Aging.
PG  - 133-140
LID - 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.20220068 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined associations between physical activity (PA) and 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in older adults free of dementia. METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional study included 3,222 individuals ≥70 years of age (1,655 men; 
      mean±SD age=79.2±5.6; cognitively unimpaired, N=2,723; mild cognitive impairment, 
      N=499) from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. PA (taken as a 
      presumed predictor) in midlife (i.e., when participants were 50-65 years of age) 
      and late life (i.e., the year prior to assessment) was assessed with a 
      self-reported, validated questionnaire; PA intensity and frequency were used to 
      calculate composite scores. NPS (taken as presumed outcomes) were assessed with 
      the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), 
      and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Regression analyses included midlife and 
      late-life PA in each model, which were adjusted for age, sex, education, 
      apolipoprotein E ɛ4 status, and medical comorbidity. RESULTS: Higher late-life PA 
      was associated with lower odds of having apathy (OR=0.89, 95% CI=0.84-0.93), 
      appetite changes (OR=0.92, 95% CI=0.87-0.98), nighttime disturbances (OR=0.95, 
      95% CI=0.91-0.99), depression (OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.90-0.97), irritability (OR=0.93, 
      95% CI=0.89-0.97), clinical depression (OR=0.92, 95% CI=0.88-0.97), and clinical 
      anxiety (OR=0.90, 95% CI=0.86-0.94), as well as lower BDI-II (β estimate=-0.042, 
      95% CI=-0.051 to -0.033) and BAI (β estimate=-0.030, 95% CI=-0.040 to -0.021) 
      scores. Higher midlife PA was associated only with higher BDI-II scores (β 
      estimate=0.011, 95% CI=0.004 to 0.019). Sex modified the associations between PA 
      and NPS. CONCLUSIONS: Late-life PA was associated with a lower likelihood of 
      clinical depression or anxiety and subclinical NPS. These findings need to be 
      confirmed in a cohort study.

AB  - Aging is a complex process associated with an impairment in functional capacity 
      and low health-related quality of life (HRQoL) due to a high frequency of chronic 
      diseases in the elderly population. Regular physical activity (PA) may limit some 
      physiological effects of sedentary lifestyle and increase life expectancy. An 
      observational was conducted to measure the HRQoL among older adults living in the 
      community, by comparing a convenience sample of elderly females practicing a 
      structured program of PA from 2 to 3 times per week in 60-min sessions (i.e., 
      active females, AFs) to a sample of participants adopting lifestyle behaviors 
      expending little energy (i.e., sedentary females, SFs). A validated questionnaire 
      (the RAND 36-item) was used as outcome measure. All participants were assessed in 
      terms of cognitive status (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA) to exclude mild 
      cognitive impairment, divided attention/executive functioning (Trail Making Test, 
      Stroop Test) and psychopathological dimensions of anxiety (Geriatric Anxiety 
      Inventory, GAI), and depression (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS). Non-parametric 
      analysis revealed that AFs and SFs differed significantly in the RAND 
      Energy/Fatigue (E/F), Emotional Wellbeing (EW), and Social Functioning (SoF), 
      that was however influenced by education level. Moreover, E/F and EW were 
      negatively associated to anxiety and depression, while SoF was influenced by 
      divided attention. PA results in a healthful behavior for combating feelings of 
      fatigue and low energy as well as emotional distress that can affect health 
      status perception in older women.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Assessment of depressive symptoms in older adults is challenging 
      especially in the presence of risks in cognitive impairment. We aimed to examine 
      whether the convergence between two measures of depressive symptoms (self-report 
      and observer ratings) is affected by varying levels of cognitive function in 
      older adults. METHODS: Self-reported scale of depression, informant-based rating 
      of affective symptoms, and global cognitive function were assessed in 2533 older 
      adults with no impairment, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. 
      The strength of rank-order correlation between the Geriatric Depression Scale 
      (GDS) and behavioral ratings of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was examined 
      as the metric of convergent validity. RESULTS: The results showed that the 
      strength of convergence between the two measurements gradually decreased as a 
      function of lowered cognitive function. Overall tendency showed that diagnoses of 
      cognitive impairment and lower levels of cognitive function were associated with 
      lower correspondence between the two depression measurements. The loss of 
      convergent validity is especially evident in the behavioral symptom of apathy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing self-report scales of depression in older adults requires 
      a cautious approach even with minimal or mild levels of cognitive impairment.

AB  - Apathy occurs in approximately one third of people after stroke. Despite its 
      frequency and functional consequences, the determinants of apathy have only been 
      partially defined. The major difficulty lies in disentangling the reduction in 
      activity due to apathy itself from those secondary to comorbidities, such as 
      depression, sensorimotor deficits, and cognitive impairment. Here, we aimed to 
      examine the prevalence of apathy, identify confounding sources of hypoactivity, 
      and define its neuroimaging determinants using multivariate voxel lesion 
      symptom-mapping (mVLSM) analyses. We assessed apathy in a subgroup (n = 325, mean 
      age: 63.8 ± 10.5 years, 91.1% ischemic stroke) of the GRECogVASC cohort using the 
      validated Behavioral Dysexecutive Syndrome Inventory, interpreted using GREFEX 
      criteria, as well as confounding factors (depression, anxiety, severity of the 
      neurological deficit, and gait disorders). mVLSM analysis was used to define 
      neuroimaging determinants and was repeated after controlling for confounding 
      factors. Apathy was present for 120 patients (36.9%, 95% CI: 31.7-42.2). Stepwise 
      linear regression identified three factors associated with apathy: depressive 
      symptoms (R(2) = .3, p = .0001), cognitive impairment (R(2) = .015, p = .02), and 
      neurological deficit (R(2) = .110, p = .0001). Accordingly, only 9 (7.5%) 
      patients had apathy without a confounding factor, i.e., isolated apathy. In 
      conventional VLSM analysis, apathy was associated with a large number of 
      subcortical lesions that were no longer considered after controlling for 
      confounding factors. Strategic site analysis identified five regions associated 
      with isolated apathy: the F3 orbitalis pars, left amygdala, left thalamus, left 
      pallidum, and mesencephalon. mVLSM analysis identified four strategic sites 
      associated with apathy: the right corticospinal tract (R(2) = .11; p = .0001), 
      left frontostriatal tract (R(2) = .11; p = .0001), left thalamus (R(2) = .04; 
      p = .0001), and left amygdala (R(2) = .01; p = .013). These regions remained 
      significant after controlling for confounding factors but explained a lower 
      amount of variance. These findings indicate that poststroke apathy is more 
      strongly associated with depression, neurological deficit, and cognitive 
      impairment than with stroke lesions locations, at least using VLSM analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Examine the relationship between the National Institutes of Health 
      Toolbox Emotion Battery (Emotion Toolbox) and traditional measures in Parkinson's 
      disease (PD). METHOD: Persons with PD (n = 30) and cognitively healthy older 
      adults (OA; n = 40) completed the Emotion Toolbox consisting of Well-Being, 
      Negative Affect, and Social Satisfaction scores along with traditional measures 
      of depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II]), anxiety (State-Trait 
      Anxiety Inventory [STAI]), and apathy (Apathy Scale [AS]); total raw scores). 
      RESULTS: Separate bootstrapped analyses of covariance indicated that the PD group 
      scored higher on BDI-II and STAI-State compared to OA (ps < .01); groups did not 
      differ on Emotion Toolbox. In the PD group, bootstrapped partial correlations 
      indicated that Negative Affect was positively related to BDI-II and STAI 
      (ps ≤ .001). Social Satisfaction was negatively related to BDI-II and STAI-Trait 
      (.05 < ps < .004). Psychological Well-Being was negatively related to BDI-II, AS, 
      and STAI (p < .004). No relationships emerged in OA. In the PD group, separate 
      binary logistic regressions showed that traditional measures (BDI-II, AS, and 
      STAI-Trait) correctly classified 79.6% those with formal psychiatric diagnoses 
      (presence vs. absence; p < .011), whereas Emotion Toolbox measures correctly 
      classified 73.3% (p < .019). CONCLUSIONS: The Emotion Toolbox showed 
      moderate-strong correlations with traditional measures in persons with PD. Even 
      so, it did not capture the group differences between PD and OA and had a somewhat 
      lower classification accuracy rate for persons with PD who had a formal 
      psychiatric diagnosis than traditional measures. Together, findings question the 
      utility of the Emotion Toolbox as a stand-alone emotion screener in PD.

TI  - Fatigue-related symptom clusters and functional status of older adults in 
      hospice.
PG  - 57-64
LID - 10.1017/S1478951522000207 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is frequently co-existing with other symptoms and is highly 
      prevalent among patients with cancer and geriatric population. There was a lack 
      of knowledge that focus on fatigue clusters in older adults with cancer in 
      hospice care. OBJECTIVES: To identify fatigue-related symptom clusters in older 
      adult hospice patients and discover to what extent fatigue-related symptom 
      clusters predict functional status while controlling for depression. METHOD: This 
      was a cross-sectional study in a sample of 519 older adult hospice patients with 
      cancer, who completed the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, the Center for 
      Epidemiological Studies Depression, Boston Short Form Scale, and the Palliative 
      Performance Scale. Data from a multi-center symptom trial were extracted for this 
      secondary analysis using exploratory factor analysis and hierarchical multiple 
      regression analysis. RESULTS: Data from 519 patients (78 ± 7 years) with terminal 
      cancer who received hospice care under home healthcare services revealed that 39% 
      of the participants experienced fatigue-related symptom clusters (lack of energy, 
      feeling drowsy, and lack of appetite). The fatigue cluster was significantly 
      associated positively with depression (r = 0.253, p < 0.01), and negatively with 
      functional status (r = -0.117, p < 0.01) and was a strong predictor of 
      participants' low functional status. Furthermore, depression made a significant 
      contribution to this predictive relationship. CONCLUSION: Older adult hospice 
      patients with cancer experienced various concurrent symptoms. The 
      fatigue-specific symptom cluster was identified significantly associated with 
      depression and predicted functional status. Fatigue should be routinely monitored 
      in older adults, especially among hospice cancer patients, to help reduce 
      psychological distress and prevent functional decline.

TI  - Measuring and Understanding the Health Impact of Greater Fatigability in Older 
      Adults: A Call to Action and Opportunities.
PG  - 188-201
LID - 10.1080/21641846.2023.2252612 [doi]
AB  - Different from fatigue, an instantaneous state of tiredness, weakness and lack of 
      energy, fatigability is a trait that contextualizes whole-body fatigue to the 
      level of activity (i.e., intensity and duration) with which the fatigue is 
      associated. Fatigability can be perceived or performance-related. Measuring 
      fatigability improves upon traditional fatigue measures by accounting for 
      self-pacing as older adults likely slow down or limit their daily activity to 
      maintain fatigue in a tolerable range. Anchoring fatigue to activities/tasks 
      improves sensitivity and allows for meaningful comparisons across 
      individuals/between studies, as well as evaluating change over time and treatment 
      effects. Two well-validated approaches are utilized to measure perceived 
      fatigability: 1) a 5-minute slow-paced (1.5 mph/0.67 m/s, 0% grade) treadmill 
      walk immediately followed by Borg rating of perceived exertion; and 2) a 
      self-administered 10-item questionnaire, Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale, with both 
      physical and mental subscales. Many walking-based performance fatigability 
      measures are based on certain lap time or distance, while the Pittsburgh 
      Performance Fatigability Index uses raw accelerometry data to quantify percent of 
      cadence decline over the entire long distance walking tasks. Perceived 
      fatigability prevalence ranges from 20-90% in older adults varying by assessment 
      tool, and is higher with advancing age and in women compared to men. Fatigability 
      is associated with physical and cognitive function, fall risk, mobility decline, 
      and mortality. Unfortunately, the available research lacks representativeness in 
      terms of racial and ethnic diversity. The time is now to incorporate our 
      established sensitive and validated fatigability measures into global research 
      and clinical practice to better understand mechanistic underpinnings and reveal 
      intervention effects to reduce the burden and lessen the consequences of greater 
      fatigability worldwide.

TI  - Distinguishing apathy and depression in older adults with mild cognitive 
      impairment using text, audio, and video based on multiclass classification and 
      shapely additive explanations.
LID - 10.1002/gps.5827 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a classification model to detect and 
      distinguish apathy and depression based on text, audio, and video features and to 
      make use of the shapely additive explanations (SHAP) toolkit to increase the 
      model interpretability. METHODS: Subjective scales and objective experiments were 
      conducted on 319 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients to measure apathy and 
      depression. The MCI patients were classified into four groups, depression only, 
      apathy only, depressed-apathetic, and the normal group. Speech, facial and text 
      features were extracted using the open-source data analysis toolkits. Multiclass 
      classification and SHAP toolkits were used to develop a classification model and 
      explain the contribution of specific features. RESULTS: The macro-averaged f1 
      score and accuracy for overall model were 0.91 and 0.90, respectively. The 
      accuracy for the apathetic, depressed, depressed-apathetic, and normal groups 
      were 0.98, 0.88, 0.93, and 0.82, respectively. The SHAP toolkit identified speech 
      features (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) 4, spectral slopes, F0, F1), 
      facial features (action unit (AU) 14, 26, 28, 45), and text feature (text 6 
      semantic) associated with apathy. Meanwhile, speech features (spectral slopes, 
      shimmer, F0) and facial expression (AU 2, 6, 7, 10, 14, 26, 45) were associated 
      with depression. Apart from the shared features mentioned above, new speech (MFCC 
      2, loudness) and facial (AU 9) features were observed in the depressive-apathetic 
      group. CONCLUSIONS: Apathy and depression shared some verbal and facial features 
      while also exhibited distinct features. A combination of text, audio, and video 
      could be used to improve the early detection and differential diagnosis of apathy 
      and depression in MCI patients.

TI  - Psychometric properties of the EURO-D scale of depressive symptomatology: 
      Evidence from SHARE wave 8.

LID - S0165-0327(22)00739-X [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: The EURO-D is a short scale to measure symptoms of depression, very 
      used in large population surveys. Although there are numerous validation studies, 
      its psychometric properties remain unclear. The two-factor structure (Affective 
      Suffering and Lack of Motivation) is replicated in several studies but with 
      different item compositions, and none reported reliability indices for both 
      factors. For that reason, the aim of this study is to examine the factorial 
      validity of the scale, the reliability of the dimensions, the gender differential 
      item functioning (DIF), and the nomological validity. METHODS: 46,317 
      participants aged 50 and over (M = 71.33), from which 57.4 % were females, in 
      Wave 8 of the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) were 
      included. INSTRUMENTS: EURO-D, R-UCLA, Self-perceived health index, and indicator 
      of taking drugs for anxiety or depression. Factor Analyses, DIF, Reliability 
      Index and Spearman correlations were estimated. RESULTS: Factor analysis 
      identified a bifactor structure: a general factor of Depression and two specific 
      factors of Affective Suffering and Lack of Motivation, which reliabilities were 
      0.83, 0.83 and 0.79 respectively. No relevant DIF item by gender was found, but 
      higher scores were found in women in all factors. Both factors had positive 
      relations with loneliness, taking drugs and self-perceived health. LIMITATIONS: 
      this study has a cross-sectional design; future research may consider the 
      longitudinal stability of the scale. CONCLUSIONS: EURO-D shows adequate 
      psychometric properties when a general factor of depression and two specific 
      factors are considered. Women have higher scores on all dimensions.

TI  - Implementing Affordable Socially Assistive Pet Robots in Care Homes Before and 
      During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Stratified Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial and 
      Mixed Methods Study.
PG  - e38864
LID - 10.2196/38864 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Robot pets may assist in the challenges of supporting an aging 
      population with growing dementia prevalence. Prior work has focused on the 
      impacts of the robot seal Paro on older adult well-being, but recent studies have 
      suggested the good acceptability and implementation feasibility of more 
      affordable devices (Joy for All [JfA] cats and dogs). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to 
      address the limited effectiveness research on JfA devices. METHODS: We conducted 
      an 8-month, stratified, cluster randomized controlled trial in 8 care homes in 
      Cornwall, United Kingdom. Over 4 months, 4 care homes each received 2 JfA devices 
      (1 cat and 1 dog; intervention group), and 4 homes received care as usual 
      (control group). Psychometrics were collected before and after the intervention 
      to compare the change from baseline to follow-up between the groups. In the final 
      4 months, all 8 care homes received devices, but only qualitative data were 
      collected owing to COVID-19 and reduced capacity. The primary outcome was 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory [NPI] Nursing Home 
      version). Care provider burden was a secondary outcome (occupational 
      disruptiveness NPI subscale), alongside the Challenging Behavior scale, the 
      Holden communication scale, the Campaign to End Loneliness questionnaire, and 
      medication use. Qualitative data were collected through care staff observation 
      calendars and end-of-study interviews to understand use, experience, and impact. 
      We also collected demographic data and assessed dementia severity. In total, 253 
      residents had robot interaction opportunities, and 83 were consented for direct 
      data collection. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the total change 
      from baseline to follow-up between the intervention and control groups for NPI 
      (P<.001) and occupational disruptiveness (P=.03). Neuropsychiatric symptoms 
      increased in the control group and decreased in the intervention group. No 
      significant difference was seen for communication issues or challenging behavior. 
      For NPI subdomains, there were significant differences from baseline to follow-up 
      in delusions (P=.03), depression (P=.01), anxiety (P=.001), elation (P=.02), and 
      apathy (P=.009), all of which decreased in the intervention group and increased 
      slightly in the control group. The summative impact results suggested that most 
      residents (46/54, 85%) who interacted with robots experienced a positive impact. 
      Those who interacted had significantly higher dementia severity scores (P=.001). 
      The qualitative results suggested good adoption, acceptability, and suitability 
      for subjectively lonely individuals and lack of a novelty effect through 
      sustained use, and demonstrated that the reasons for use were entertainment, 
      anxiety, and agitation. CONCLUSIONS: Affordable robot pets hold potential for 
      improving the well-being of care home residents and people with dementia, 
      including reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms and occupational disruptiveness. 
      This work suggests no novelty effect and contributes toward understanding robot 
      pet suitability. Moreover, interactions were more common among residents with 
      more moderate/severe dementia and those subjectively lonely. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

LID - 10.1177/08982643211055032 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Examine the association between personality measures and perceived 
      mental fatigability. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis in N=1670 
      men, age 84.3±4.1 years. Multivariable linear regression models were used to 
      examine the covariate adjusted association between personality measures 
      (conscientiousness, optimism, goal reengagement, and goal disengagement) and 
      perceived mental fatigability (measured with the validated 10-item Pittsburgh 
      Fatigability Scale, PFS). RESULTS: One standard deviation lower conscientiousness 
      (β=-0.91, p<.0001) and optimism (β=-0.63, p<.0001), and higher goal reengagement 
      (β=0.51, p=.01) scores were independently associated with higher PFS Mental 
      scores adjusted for age, cognitive function, self-reported health status, 
      depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance, physical activity, and goal 
      disengagement. DISCUSSION: Lower conscientiousness, optimism, and higher goal 
      reengagement were linked with more severe perceived mental fatigability in older 
      men. Personality traits may potentially contribute to early risk assessment for 
      fatigability in later life. Future work should be longitudinal in nature and 
      include personality assessments to confirm the temporality of the relationships 
      observed.

AB  - Depression is a common mental health illness worldwide that affects our quality 
      of life and ability to work. Although prior research has used EEG signals to 
      increase the accuracy to identify depression, the rates of underdiagnosis remain 
      high, and novel methods are required to identify depression. In this study, we 
      built a model based on single-channel, dry-electrode EEG sensor technology to 
      detect state depression, which measures the intensity of depressive feelings and 
      cognitions at a particular time. To test the accuracy of our model, we compared 
      the results of our model with other commonly used methods for depression 
      diagnosis, including the PHQ-9, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and 
      House-Tree-Person (HTP) drawing test, in three different studies. In study 1, we 
      compared the results of our model with PHQ-9 in a sample of 158 senior high 
      students. The results showed that the consistency rate of the two methods was 
      61.4%. In study 2, the results of our model were compared with HAM-D among 71 
      adults. We found that the consistency rate of state-depression identification by 
      the two methods was 63.38% when a HAM-D score above 7 was considered depression, 
      while the consistency rate increased to 83.10% when subjects showed at least one 
      depressive symptom (including depressed mood, guilt, suicide, lack of interest, 
      retardation). In study 3, 68 adults participated in the study, and the results 
      revealed that the consistency rate of our model and HTP drawing test was 91.2%. 
      The results showed that our model is an effective means to identify state 
      depression. Our study demonstrates that using our model, people with state 
      depression could be identified in a timely manner and receive interventions or 
      treatments, which may be helpful for the early detection of depression.

TI  - Assessment of Anxiety and Depression among Adult Population of Kashmir, India: A 
      Cross-sectional Study.
PG  - 25-29
LID - 10.7860/jcdr/2022/53746.16649 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mental health in Kashmir remains a concern and is threatening to 
      become an ever-increasing epidemic. The changing social structure and the 
      low-intensity armed conflict have become the basis of a deteriorating state of 
      mental health among Kashmiris. In addition to this, the other factors are 
      widespread poverty, uncertainty, grief, oppression, fear and high unemployment 
      with limited employment generating sectors. AIM: To assess the depression, 
      anxiety and mental distress among the adult population of Budgam district, 
      Kashmir, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at 
      the community level in District Budgam, Jammu and Kashmir, India, from December 
      2019 to March 2020. Total three Investigators, one Senior Research Fellow (SRF) 
      and two Junior Research Fellow (JRF) collected the data. The SRF was a Clinical 
      Psychologist while the JRF were trained social workers. A door to door survey was 
      conducted in the villages which were selected randomly from the list of the 
      villages. The probability random sampling technique was used for the research 
      purpose. Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) was used in the study and 
      whereby after analysing the scores of the scale, results were derived. Chi-square 
      and t-test were applied for statistical comparison. RESULTS: Out of 133 
      individuals, 55 were males and 78 were females.The age of the sample ranged from 
      18 to 45 years, with a mean age of 37 years. Total 29.32% of the adults scored 
      above the cut-off for anxiety symptoms and 34.58% scored above the cut-off for 
      depressive symptoms, while 39% of these adults fall above the cut-off for mental 
      distress scores.The validated cut-off score for the anxiety was 1.75 and for the 
      depression was 1.57. Feeling tense, being worried, nervousness and low energy 
      were reported as the symptoms of the mental distress among the people. Females, 
      unemployed and individuals from lower socio-economic status reported higher 
      degree of mental distress than others. CONCLUSION: Mental health issues in terms 
      of anxiety, depression, and mental distress are found among the adult population 
      in district Budgam. There was a significant mean difference in the mental 
      distress levels concerning various socio-demographic variables. The study 
      concluded that being female, having some medical condition, being unemployed, 
      belonging to lower socio-economic status, belonging to nuclear family predict 
      mental health distress.

TI  - A novel approach to investigate depression symptoms in the aging population using 
      generalizability theory.
PG  - 684-696
LID - 10.1037/pas0001129 [doi]
AB  - As depression is common in older people and confers significant risk for 
      dementia, its accurate assessment is essential. The 15-item Geriatric Depression 
      Scale (GDS-15) is a widely used assessment tool for measuring depression in aged 
      populations, and its psychometric properties have been recently improved using 
      Rasch analysis. However, its temporal reliability and ability to distinguish 
      between dynamic and enduring symptoms of depression have not been examined using 
      the appropriate methodology. Generalizability theory (G theory) is a suitable 
      method to distinguish between enduring and dynamic symptoms of depression and to 
      evaluate the reliability of the GDS-15 scores and sources of measurement error. 
      We applied G theory to the longitudinal GDS-15 data of 354 participants from the 
      Sydney Memory and Ageing Study, collected biennially over 10 years, from 
      individuals aged 70 years and older. The GDS-15 demonstrated strong reliability 
      and generalizability of its test scores in measuring enduring symptoms of 
      depression (G(a) = 0.82, G(r) = 0.90) across the sample population and occasions, 
      and indicated that depression scores significantly increased over time. In 
      addition, three identified dynamic symptoms of depression, namely helplessness, 
      hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities, did not affect the overall 
      reliability of the GDS-15. Thus, the GDS-15 is a reliable measure for assessing 
      enduring symptoms of depression and can be used to evaluate the efficacy of 
      depression treatments and monitor depression levels over time in older adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coping strategies play a vital role in cancer management and has been 
      an integral part in the recovery process of cancer patients worldwide. Coping 
      refers to specific efforts; both behavioral and psychological, that diminishes 
      stresses emerged in cancer patients. This study evaluated the psychometric 
      properties of the Sinhalese version of the Coping Orientation to Problems 
      Experienced Inventory (S-BC) which was developed based on the Brief COPE scale  
      for cancer patients in Sri Lanka. METHODS: The original Brief COPE is a 
      self-administered tool with 28 items designed to measure coping methods used by 
      people in stressful life events. It consisted of statements related to adaptive 
      and maladaptive coping strategies. Forty patients with cancer who were registered 
      at the Oncology ward, Teaching Hospital, Galle, Sri Lanka were included in the 
      study. A cross-cultural adaptation of the Brief COPE was done using WHO 
      guidelines. Reliability of the S-BC was assessed using test-retest and internal 
      consistency procedures. The construct validity of the tool was assessed by 
      performing exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis 
      (CFA). Convergent and discriminant validity of the S-BC was tested using World 
      Health Organization-Quality of Life-Brief scale (WHOQOL-BREF) and Centre for 
      Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D). RESULTS: The mean (± SD) age of 
      the sample was 61(± 12) years, and 52.5% (n = 21) of the participants were men. 
      Eighty percent (n = 32) of the participants were more than one year of treatment 
      from diagnosing as a cancer patient. The test-retest reliability of the S-BC was 
      0.66, and the internal consistency of the S-BC was good (Cronbach's alpha - 
      0.819). Both EFA and CFA revealed a structure comprised of seven factors. Such 
      factors were Avoidance/Behavioral disengagement, Religious faith/Acceptance, 
      Seeking support, Planning, Substance use/Venting, Self-blame and Active/positive 
      coping. The scores of the adaptive coping of the S-BC was negatively and 
      the scores of the maladaptive coping of the S-BC was positively correlated with 
      the CES-D score.   The scores of the adaptive coping of the S-BC was  positively 
      correlated with the total score of the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire indicating 
      the S-BC's convergent and discriminant validity properties. CONCLUSION: The 
      Sinhalese version of the Brief COPE is found to be a valid and a reliable measure 
      to assess coping strategies used by  patients with cancer in Sri Lanka.

TI  - Awareness of age-related change, future time perspective, and implications for 
      goal adjustment in older adulthood.
PG  - 1189-1197
LID - 10.1080/13607863.2021.1893269 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: How people adjust their goals is central to adaptation across the 
      lifespan. However, little is known about individual difference characteristics 
      that predict how and why people use different self-regulatory strategies. The 
      present study investigated associations of perceived age-related gains and 
      losses, and their interaction, as predictors of goal adjustment in older 
      adulthood. Furthermore, we examined whether future time perspective (FTP) 
      mediated relationships between awareness of age-related change (AARC) and goal 
      adjustment. METHOD: A community-based sample of 408 adults (aged 60-88 years) was 
      recruited via an internet-based research platform. Participants completed 
      questionnaire measures of AARC, FTP, goal disengagement, and goal re-engagement. 
      A flexibility index reflecting tendencies toward use of both goal disengagement 
      and goal re-engagement strategies was also analyzed. RESULTS: Although 
      AARC-losses was associated with lower goal re-engagement and goal flexibility, 
      this association was weaker among those with higher AARC-gains, indicating 
      AARC-gains may be protective in the relationship between AARC-losses and goal 
      adjustment. The association between AARC and goal adjustment was also shown to be 
      mediated by FTP. Higher AARC-gains was associated with more expansive FTP, which 
      was associated with lower goal disengagement and higher goal re-engagement. On 
      the other hand, higher AARC-losses was associated with more restricted FTP, which 
      was associated with higher goal disengagement and lower goal re-engagement. 
      DISCUSSION: Results have implications for how we conceptualize the combined 
      effects of age-related gains and losses on developmental outcomes relevant to 
      adaptive aging. Furthermore, perceptions of future time with advancing age may be 
      implicated in processes linking AARC with goal adjustment.

TI  - The 3-Item "Apathy" Subscale Within the GDS-15 Is Not Supported in De Novo 
      Parkinson's Disease Patients: Analysis of the PPMI Cohort.
PG  - 309-316
LID - 10.1177/0891988720988908 [doi]
AB  - This study examined individual components of the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 
      (GDS-15) to determine whether the 3-item Withdrawal-Apathy-Lack of Vigor (WAV) 
      subscale, which has been validated in older adults and advanced Parkinson's 
      disease (PD), was applicable to newly diagnosed patients with PD. Baseline 
      Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) data (n = 345), including 
      GDS-15 and Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale 
      (MDS-UPDRS) depression, apathy, and anxiety scores, were examined. Data reduction 
      techniques (i.e., principal components, confirmatory factor analyses) were used. 
      Model fit was poor for the previously identified GDS-15 factor structures. Via 
      principal components analysis, 5 components were identified, none of which 
      reflected the 3-item WAV subscale previously reported in the literature. Internal 
      consistency of the GDS-15 was acceptable, as was the internal consistency for the 
      largest component (labeled "Dysphoria"). All 5 components significantly 
      correlated with the MDS-UPDRS depression, apathy, and anxiety items. Model fit 
      was fair for the "Dysphoria" factor only. Overall, the 3-item WAV factor reported 
      in previous literature was not supported in this sample of de novo PD patients.

LID - 10.1016/j.regg.2022.01.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hopelessness is characterized by a set of negative 
      cognitive schemas about the future, conceptualized on the basis of three 
      dimensions: affective, motivational and cognitive. This construct is linked to 
      loneliness, the incidence of which in older adults is increasingly high. The aim 
      of this research is to test whether hopelessness factors predict levels of 
      loneliness in older adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 138 non-institutionalized 
      persons from Valencia city between 65-90 years old participated, with a mean age 
      of 73.67 (SD=4.8), and 59.4% were women. The Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and 
      University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale (UCLA) were administered to 
      assess participants. RESULTS: The motivational and cognitive factors acted as 
      statistically significant predictors of loneliness, while the affective factor 
      was not presented as a significant factor. The final model obtained an 
      R(2)adj=.442, F(3, 87)=23.97, p<.001. CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness is a phenomenon of 
      great concern in the field of gerontology due to its high incidence and impact. 
      The results indicate that hopelessness, specifically loss of motivation and 
      negative expectations about the future, are critical issues for the development 
      of feelings of loneliness in older adults. Thus, it is relevant to pay attention 
      to these variables in order to apply loneliness prevention programs.

AB  - Late-life depression (LLD) increases risk for dementia and brain pathology, but 
      possibly this is only true for one or more symptom profiles of LLD. In 4354 
      participants (76 ± 5 years; 58% female) from the Age, Gene/Environment 
      Susceptibility (AGES)-Reykjavik Study, we identified five LLD symptom profiles, 
      based on the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (no LLD (57%); apathy (31%); apathy 
      with emptiness (2%), mild LLD (8%) and severe LLD (2%)). Cox regression analyses 
      showed that severe LLD, mild LLD and apathy increased risk of dementia up to 12 
      years, compared to no LLD. Additionally, hippocampal volume loss and white matter 
      lesion increase, were assessed on 1.5 T MR images, at baseline and after 5 years 
      follow-up. Only severe LLD showed increased WML volume over time, but not on 
      hippocampal volume loss. WML increase over time mediated partially the relation 
      between mild LLD and dementia but not for the other symptom profiles. It appears 
      that hippocampal atrophy and LLD are independent predictors for dementia 
      incidence, whereas for mild LLD the risk for dementia is partially mediated by 
      WML changes.

TI  - Self-reported lack of energy or feeling depressed 12 months after treatment in 
      men diagnosed with prostate cancer within a population-based registry.
PG  - 496-503

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Feeling depressed and lethargic are common side effects of prostate 
      cancer (PCa) and its treatments. We examined the incidence and severity of 
      feeling depressed and lack of energy in patients in a population based PCa 
      registry. METHODS: We included men diagnosed with PCa between 2015 and 2019 in 
      Victoria, Australia, and enrolled in the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry. The 
      primary outcome measures were responses to two questions on the Expanded Prostate 
      Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) patient reported instrument: problems with 
      feeling depressed and problems with lack of energy 12 months following treatment. 
      We evaluated associations between these and age, cancer risk category, treatment 
      type, and urinary, bowel, and sexual function. RESULTS: Both outcome questions 
      were answered by 9712 out of 12,628 (77%) men. 981 patients (10%) reported at 
      least moderate problems with feeling depressed; 1563 (16%) had at least moderate 
      problems with lack of energy and 586 (6.0%) with both. Younger men reported 
      feeling depressed more frequently than older men. Lack of energy was more common 
      for treatments that included androgen deprivation therapy than not (moderate/big 
      problems: 31% vs. 13%), irrespective of disease risk category. Both outcomes were 
      associated with poorer urinary, bowel, and sexual functional domain scores. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported depressive feelings and lack of energy were frequent 
      in this population-based registry. Problems with feeling depressed were more 
      common in younger men and lack of energy more common in men having hormonal 
      treatment. Clinicians should be aware of the incidence of these symptoms in these 
      at-risk groups and be able to screen for them.

TI  - Sarcopenia and motoric cognitive risk syndrome: a moderated mediation model.
PG  - 141
LID - 10.1186/s12877-022-02802-4 [doi]
LID - 141
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia has been identified as a risk factor for cognitive 
      impairment, and motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a recently defined 
      pre-dementia syndrome. It is not known whether they are related. We aimed to 
      investigate the association and potential pathways between sarcopenia and MCR in 
      the community elderly by establishing a moderated mediation model. METHODS: 846 
      community residents aged ≥ 60 years were recruited from May 2021 to September 
      2021 and had a comprehensive geriatric evaluation. The diagnosis of sarcopenia 
      followed the criteria issued by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia in 2019. 
      MCR was defined as subjective cognitive decline and slow gait. Apathy symptoms 
      and physical activity were assessed by the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) and the 
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Logistic regression and 
      moderated mediation analyses were conducted to explore the association between 
      the four. RESULTS: 60 (7.1%) had MCR among 846 participants. After full 
      adjustment, sarcopenia (odds ratio [OR] = 3.81, 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] = 1.69-8.60, P = 0.001), AES score (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.04-1.14, 
      P < 0.001), and IPAQ level (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.28-0.66, P < 0.001) were 
      associated with MCR. Apathy partially mediated the relationship between 
      sarcopenia and MCR. Physical activity played a moderation role in the indirect 
      pathway of the mediation model. The increase in physical activity can alleviate 
      the indirect effect of sarcopenia on MCR. CONCLUSION: We established a moderated 
      mediation model to uncover the underlying association mechanism of sarcopenia and 
      MCR preliminarily. These findings suggest that attention should be paid to the 
      management of apathy and physical activity in the context of sarcopenia to 
      prevent early dementia actively. Further validation is needed in future 
      longitudinal studies.

AB  - The prevalence of late-life depression (LLD) depends on the study sample, 
      measurements, and diagnostic approaches. We estimated the 30 item-Geriatric 
      Depression Scale (GDS-30) accuracy against the gold standard LLD diagnosis made 
      with the Semi-structured Clinical Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I 
      Disorders, focusing on the prevalence of a late-life major depressive disorder 
      (MDD), in a population-based sample of 843 subjects aged>65 years, subdivided 
      into three groups: normal cognition, subjective memory complaints, and mild 
      cognitive impairment. At the optimal cut-off score (≥4), the GDS-30 showed 65.1% 
      sensitivity and 68.4% specificity for LLD (63% and 66% for late-life MDD, 
      respectively). Using the standard cut-off score (≥10), the GDS-30 specificity 
      reached 91.2%, while sensitivity dropped to 37.7%, indicating a lower screening 
      accuracy [area under the curve(AUC):0.728, 95% confidence 
      interval(CI):0.67-0-78]. The GDS-30 performance was associated with educational 
      level, but not with age, gender, cognition, apathy, and somatic/psychiatric 
      multimorbidity. For subjective memory complaints subjects, at the optimal cut-off 
      score (≥7), the GDS-30 showed better discrimination performances 
      (AUC=0.792,95%CI:0.60-0.98), but again the educational level affected the 
      diagnostic performance. In subjective memory complaints subjects, symptom-based 
      scales like the GDS-30 may feature a better performance for diagnosing depression 
      in older age, but the GDS-30 seems to require adjustment to the patient's 
      educational level.

TI  - Lasting Symptoms After Esophageal Resection (LASER): European Multicenter 
      Cross-sectional Study.
PG  - e392-e400
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000003917 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the most prevalent symptoms and those with greatest impact 
      upon health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among esophageal cancer survivors. 
      BACKGROUND: Long-term symptom burden after esophagectomy, and associations with 
      HRQOL, are poorly understood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2010 and 2016, 
      patients from 20 European Centers who underwent esophageal cancer surgery, and 
      were disease-free at least 1 year postoperatively were asked to complete LASER, 
      EORTC-QLQ-C30, and QLQ-OG25 questionnaires. Specific symptom questionnaire items 
      that were associated with poor HRQOL as identified by EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OG25 
      were identified by multivariable regression analysis and combined to form a tool. 
      RESULTS: A total of 876 of 1081 invited patients responded to the questionnaire, 
      giving a response rate of 81%. Of these, 66.9% stated in the last 6 months they 
      had symptoms associated with their esophagectomy. Ongoing weight loss was 
      reported by 10.4% of patients, and only 13.8% returned to work with the same 
      activities.Three LASER symptoms were correlated with poor HRQOL on multivariable 
      analysis; pain on scars on chest (odds ratio (OR) 1.27; 95% CI 0.97-1.65), low 
      mood (OR 1.42; 95% CI 1.15-1.77) and reduced energy or activity tolerance (OR 
      1.37; 95% CI 1.18-1.59). The areas under the curves for the development and 
      validation datasets were 0.81 ± 0.02 and 0.82 ± 0.09 respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      Two-thirds of patients experience significant symptoms more than 1 year after 
      surgery. The 3 key symptoms associated with poor HRQOL identified in this study 
      should be further validated, and could be used in clinical practice to identify 
      patients who require increased support.

TI  - Measuring neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with early cognitive decline 
      using speech analysis.
PG  - e64
LID - 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.2236 [doi]
LID - e64
AB  - BACKGROUND: Certain neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), namely apathy, depression, 
      and anxiety demonstrated great value in predicting dementia progression, 
      representing eventually an opportunity window for timely diagnosis and treatment. 
      However, sensitive and objective markers of these symptoms are still missing. 
      Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the association between 
      automatically extracted speech features and NPS in patients with mild 
      neurocognitive disorders. METHODS: Speech of 141 patients aged 65 or older with 
      neurocognitive disorder was recorded while performing two short narrative speech 
      tasks. NPS were assessed by the neuropsychiatric inventory. Paralinguistic 
      markers relating to prosodic, formant, source, and temporal qualities of speech 
      were automatically extracted, correlated with NPS. Machine learning experiments 
      were carried out to validate the diagnostic power of extracted markers. RESULTS: 
      Different speech variables are associated with specific NPS; apathy correlates 
      with temporal aspects, and anxiety with voice quality-and this was mostly 
      consistent between male and female after correction for cognitive impairment. 
      Machine learning regressors are able to extract information from speech features 
      and perform above baseline in predicting anxiety, apathy, and depression scores. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Different NPS seem to be characterized by distinct speech features, 
      which are easily extractable automatically from short vocal tasks. These findings 
      support the use of speech analysis for detecting subtypes of NPS in patients with 
      cognitive impairment. This could have great implications for the design of future 
      clinical trials as this cost-effective method could allow more continuous and 
      even remote monitoring of symptoms.

TI  - Characterization of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and mild cognitive impairment 
      using the Lewy body dementia module (LBD-MOD).
PG  - 1675-1686
LID - 10.1002/alz.12334 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Research Center 
      program added the Lewy body dementia module (LBD-MOD) to the Uniform Data Set to 
      facilitate LBD characterization and distinguish dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) 
      from Alzheimer's disease (AD). We tested the performance of the LBD-MOD. METHODS: 
      The LBD-MOD was completed in a single-site study in 342 participants: 53 
      controls, 78 AD, and 110 DLB; 79 mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-AD); 
      and 22 MCI-DLB. RESULTS: DLB differed from AD in extrapyramidal symptoms, 
      hallucinations, apathy, autonomic features, REM sleep behaviors, daytime 
      sleepiness, cognitive fluctuations, timed attention tasks, and visual perception. 
      MCI-DLB differed from MCI-AD in extrapyramidal features, mood, autonomic 
      features, fluctuations, timed attention tasks, and visual perception. Descriptive 
      data on LBD-MOD measures are provided for reference. DISCUSSION: The LBD-MOD 
      provided excellent characterization of core and supportive features to 
      differentiate DLB from AD and healthy controls while also characterizing features 
      of MCI-DLB.

TI  - The Effect of Reminiscence Therapy Using Virtual Reality on Apathy in Residential 
      Aged Care: Multisite Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e29210
LID - 10.2196/29210 [doi]
LID - e29210
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a frequent and underrecognized neurological disorder 
      symptom. Reduced goal-directed behavior caused by apathy is associated with poor 
      outcomes for older adults in residential aged care. Recommended 
      nonpharmacological treatments include person-centered therapy using information 
      and communication technology. Virtual reality (VR) in the form of head-mounted 
      displays (HMDs) is a fully immersive technology that provides access to a wide 
      range of freely available content. The use of VR as a therapy tool has 
      demonstrated promise in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder and 
      anxiety. In addition, VR has been used to improve conditions including 
      depression, anxiety, cognitive function, and balance in older adults with memory 
      deficits, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease. Research using VR for the 
      symptoms of apathy in older adults living in residential aged care facilities is 
      limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine whether using HMDs as a tool for 
      reminiscence therapy improves the symptoms of apathy compared with using a laptop 
      computer and physical items with older adults living in residential aged care. 
      METHODS: In this multisite trial, 43 participants were allocated to one of three 
      groups: reminiscence therapy intervention using VR in the form of HMDs, 
      reminiscence therapy using a laptop computer supplemented by physical items if 
      required (active control), and a usual care (passive control) group. The primary 
      outcome was apathy, and the secondary outcomes included cognition and depression. 
      The side effects of using HMDs were also measured in the VR group. RESULTS: Mixed 
      model analyses revealed no significant group interaction over time in outcomes 
      between the VR and laptop groups (estimate=-2.24, SE 1.89; t(40)=-1.18; P=.24). 
      Pooled apathy scores in the two intervention groups compared with the passive 
      control group also revealed no significant group interaction over time 
      (estimate=-0.26, SE 1.66; t(40)=-0.16; P=.88). There were no significant 
      secondary outcomes. Most participants in the VR group stated that they would 
      prefer to watch content in VR than on a flat screen (Χ(2)(2)=11.2; P=.004), side 
      effects from HMD use were negligible to minimal according to the Simulator 
      Sickness Questionnaire cutoff scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although there were no 
      significant results in outcome measures, this study found that participants 
      engaged in the research and enjoyed the process of reminiscing using both forms 
      of technology. It was found that VR can be implemented in an aged care setting 
      with correct protocols in place. Providing residents in aged care with a choice 
      of technology may assist in increasing participation in activities. We cannot 
      dismiss the importance of immediate effects while the therapy was in progress, 
      and this is an avenue for future research. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the 
      Neurological Fatigue Index-Stroke (C-NFI-Stroke) in stroke survivors. DESIGN: 
      This was a validation study. Cross-cultural adaptation of the scale was conducted 
      according to standard guidelines. Reliability, validity, responsiveness, and 
      interpretability were measured. SETTING: Self-help groups and a community center. 
      SUBJECTS: One hundred and twelve Chinese stroke survivors and 65 healthy Chinese 
      older people living in the community. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN 
      MEASURES: The C-NFI-Stroke, Fatigue Severity Scale, Mental Fatigue Scale, General 
      Self-Efficacy Scale, and Geriatric Depression Scale were used. RESULTS: 
      Cronbach's α coefficients were 0.69-0.88; the item-level agreement was 
      70.4%-88.9%; the weighted Kappa value was 0.47-0.79; and the intra-class 
      correlation coefficients were 0.88-0.93. The C-NFI-Stroke had no ceiling and 
      floor effects. It had good content validity and had two factors, "lack of energy" 
      and "tiredness/weakness." The confirmatory factor analysis showed a good fit to 
      the model. The C-NFI-Stroke significantly correlated with existing fatigue scales 
      (r(s) = 0.55-0.63), self-efficacy (r(s) = -0.31 to -0.37), and depressive 
      symptoms (r(s) = 0.53-0.60). The C-NFI-Stroke could discern differences between 
      stroke survivors and healthy older people. CONCLUSIONS: The C-NFI-Stroke is a 
      reliable and valid tool for clinical and research use on people who have been 
      diagnosed with stroke for a year or more, although its factor structure differs 
      from that of the original English version.

TI  - Is Depression or Apathy Playing a Key Role in Predicting Financial Capacity in 
      Parkinson's Disease with Dementia and Frontotemporal Dementia?
LID - 10.3390/brainsci11060785 [doi]
LID - 785
AB  - (1) Background: Depression and apathy both affect cognitive abilities, such as 
      thinking, concentration and making decisions in young and old individuals. 
      Although apathy is claimed to be a "core" feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) and 
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD), it may occur in the absence of depression and vice 
      versa. Thus, the aim of this study is to explore whether depression or apathy 
      better predict financial capacity performance in PD and FTD as well as in 
      nondemented participants. (2) Methods: Eighty-eight participants divided into 
      three groups (PD, FTD and non-demented participants) were examined with the 
      Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Legal Capacity for Property Law 
      Transactions Assessment Scale (LCPLTAS)-Full and short form. The Geriatric 
      Depression Scale informant version (GDS-15) and the Irritability-Apathy Scale 
      (IAS) we completed by caregivers. (3) Results: The results indicated that both PD 
      and FTD patients' general cognitive functioning and financial capacity 
      performance is negatively influenced by apathy and not by depression. (4) 
      Conclusions: Differences in financial capacity performance indicate that apathy 
      should not be disregarded in clinical assessments. Further studies on larger PD 
      and FTD populations are necessary in order to investigate the decisive role of 
      mood factors on financial capacity impairment.

      neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life (QoL), and social withdrawal, within a 
      multicomponent, interdisciplinary antipsychotic and benzodiazepine dose reduction 
      program. DESIGN: Prospective, observational, longitudinal study. INTERVENTION: 
      The Reducing Use of Sedatives (RedUSe) project involved 150 Australian Long-Term 
      Care Facilities (LTCFs) incorporating auditing and benchmarking of prescribing, 
      education, and multidisciplinary sedative reviews. SETTING: A convenience sample 
      of LTCFs (n = 28) involved in RedUSe between January 2015 and March 2016. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Permanent residents (n = 206) of LTCFs involved in RedUSe taking an 
      antipsychotic and/or benzodiazepine daily. Residents were excluded if they had a 
      severe psychiatric condition where antipsychotic therapy should generally be 
      maintained long-term (e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia) or were considered 
      end-stage palliative. MEASUREMENTS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric 
      Inventory, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI)), QoL (Assessment of 
      Quality of Life-4D), and social withdrawal (Multidimensional Observation Scale 
      for Elderly Subjects-withdrawal subscale) were measured at baseline and 4 months 
      where nursing staff completed psychometric tests as proxy raters. RESULTS: There 
      was no evidence that psychometric measures were worsened following dose 
      reductions. In fact, dose reduction was associated with small, albeit 
      non-statistically significant, improvements in behavior, particularly less 
      physically non-aggressive behavior with both drug groups (-0.36 points per 10% 
      reduction in antipsychotic dose, -0.17 per 10% reduction in benzodiazepine dose) 
      and verbally agitated behavior with benzodiazepine reduction (-0.16 per 10% dose 
      reduction), as measured with the CMAI. Furthermore, antipsychotic reduction was 
      associated with non-statistically significant improvements in QoL and social 
      withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine dose reduction in LTCFs 
      was not associated with deterioration in neuropsychiatric symptoms, QoL, or 
      social withdrawal. Trends toward improved agitation with antipsychotic and 
      benzodiazepine dose reduction require further evaluation in larger, prospective, 
      controlled studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to understand the relationship between resource 
      gains and losses, coping, and the quality of life during the growth phase of the 
      COVID‑19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Internet-based survey covered 353 
      individuals who had participated in a psychological support project operated by 
      one of the non-governmental organizations in Lublin, Poland, in the 12 months 
      prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. The questionnaire used in the study 
      contained questions to collect sociodemographic data and psychometric scales to 
      measure resource gains and losses (the Conservation of Resources - Evaluation 
      questionnaire), the quality of life (the World Health Organization Quality of 
      Life-BREF), and strategies of coping with the pandemic situation (a modified 
      Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced questionnaire). RESULTS: A 
      higher global quality of life occurred with higher gains and minor losses, as 
      well as with coping through planning, positive reframing, emotional support 
      seeking, a reduced substance use tendency, low self-blame, avoidance, and 
      disengagement. Moreover, helplessness-based coping strategies were found to 
      mediate both the relationships between resource gains and the quality of life, 
      and between resource losses and the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Factors that 
      may reduce people's quality of life during the COVID‑19 pandemic are an increase 
      in losses and limited gains, experienced over the 6 months preceding the 
      pandemic, as well as not using active, meaning-oriented, and support-seeking 
      coping strategies, but using avoidance behaviors instead. Coping strategies 
      specific to people experiencing helplessness are a mediating mechanism between 
      losses and limited gains of resources, and the quality of life. Int J Occup Med 
      Environ Health. 2021;34(2):275-87.

TI  - Is geriatric depression scale a valid instrument to screen depression in Chinese 
      community-dwelling elderly?
PG  - 310

AB  - BACKGROUND: The geriatric depression scale (GDS) is used widely as a screening 
      instrument for depression worldwide. The present study aims to examine the 
      reliability and validity of the GDS with 30 items (GDS-30) in Chinese cognitively 
      normal elderly, and to preliminarily investigate the appropriateness of the 
      GDS-30 among screened mild cognitive impairment (MCI) elderly and among the 
      large-scale community-dwelling Chinese elderly. METHODS: A total of 12,610 
      Chinese elderly completed GDS-30 in the project of Community-based Cohort Study 
      on Nervous System Diseases. Of these, 5503 individuals with the ability to 
      perform basic daily living activities were randomly sampled to further complete 
      the Montreal Cognitive Assessment to screen for MCI. The cutoff value of screened 
      depression was 11, and the cutoff values of MCI were education-dependent. 
      Internal consistency was used to evaluate the reliability. Exploratory factor 
      analysis (EFA) was used to determine the factor structure. Confirmatory factor 
      analysis (CFA) was conducted to assess the construct validity in the elderly 
      screened normal cognition, screened MCI, and the whole population, respectively. 
      RESULTS: The Kuder-Richardson coefficient (KR20) was 0.834, 0.821 and 0.840 for 
      the cognitively normal elderly, screened MCI and the whole population, 
      respectively. EFA showed that GDS-30 can be either a four-factor model (named 
      positive mood, dysphoria, worry, and social withdrawal-cognitive impairment) or a 
      two-factor model (named depression and positive mood). The latter was easier to 
      interpret. CFA showed that the two-factor model fitted well in the elderly with 
      normal cognition, with screened MCI, and the whole sample. The factors loaded 
      from 0.900 to 0.588, 0.882 to 0.529, and 0.888 to 0.556 in these three 
      populations respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The GDS-30 has good reliability and 
      validity and can be appropriately applied to screen depression in the large-scale 
      community-dwelling Chinese elderly regardless of the presence of mild cognitive 
      impairment.

TI  - Timing and Impact of Psychiatric, Cognitive, and Motor Abnormalities in 
      Huntington Disease.
PG  - e2395-e2406
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000011893 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence, timing, and functional impact of 
      psychiatric, cognitive, and motor abnormalities in Huntington disease (HD) gene 
      carriers, we analyzed retrospective clinical data from individuals with manifest 
      HD. METHODS: Clinical features of patients with HD were analyzed for 6,316 
      individuals in an observational study of the European Huntington's Disease 
      Network (REGISTRY) from 161 sites across 17 countries. Data came from clinical 
      history and the patient-completed Clinical Characteristics Questionnaire that 
      assessed 8 symptoms: motor, cognitive, apathy, depression, 
      perseverative/obsessive behavior, irritability, violent/aggressive behavior, and 
      psychosis. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze relationships between 
      symptoms and functional outcomes. RESULTS: The initial manifestation of HD is 
      increasingly likely to be motor and less likely to be psychiatric as age at 
      presentation increases and is independent of pathogenic CAG repeat length. The 
      Clinical Characteristics Questionnaire captures data on nonmotor symptom 
      prevalence that correlate specifically with validated clinical measures. 
      Psychiatric and cognitive symptoms are common in HD gene carriers, with earlier 
      onsets associated with longer CAG repeats. Of patients with HD, 42.4% reported at 
      least 1 psychiatric or cognitive symptom before motor symptoms, with depression 
      most common. Each nonmotor symptom was associated with significantly reduced 
      total functional capacity scores. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric and cognitive symptoms 
      are common and functionally debilitating in HD gene carriers. They require 
      recognition and targeting with clinical outcome measures and treatments. However, 
      because it is impossible to distinguish confidently between nonmotor symptoms 
      arising from HD and primary psychiatric disorders, particularly in younger 
      premanifest patients, nonmotor symptoms should not be used to make a clinical 
      diagnosis of HD. TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the role of mobility 
      limitations and vitality, as well as additional factors such as comorbidities, to 
      predict post-stroke pain. MATERIALS & METHODS: This study included 
      cross-sectional data from 214 participants living in varied settings in different 
      parts of Sweden. Participants were asked to complete the Stroke Impact Scale, 
      Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36, and Self-administered Comorbidity 
      Questionnaire to evaluate mobility, vitality, comorbidities, and pain. 
      Descriptive statistics were used for demographic and clinical characteristics. 
      Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to predict the pain domain 
      score on Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36. RESULTS: The mean age of all 
      participants in the sample was 66 years (SD 14); 43.4% of the study population 
      were women. After analyses, "standing without losing balance and vitality'' were 
      found to be significant predictors in the model which explained the pain score on 
      Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the results 
      suggest that restrictions in mobility and low vitality have an important role on 
      the occurrence of post-stroke pain. Having post-stroke pain could be due to not 
      able to stand without losing balance and low vitality. Thus, rehabilitation 
      professionals may consider the importance of these factors, especially mobility 
      restrictions, in preventing post-stroke pain.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Little is known about long-term sequelae of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To 
      describe the consequences at 4 months in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a prospective uncontrolled cohort study, 
      survivors of COVID-19 who had been hospitalized in a university hospital in 
      France between March 1 and May 29, 2020, underwent a telephone assessment 4 
      months after discharge, between July 15 and September 18, 2020. Patients with 
      relevant symptoms and all patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) 
      were invited for further assessment at an ambulatory care visit. EXPOSURES: 
      Survival of hospitalization for COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Respiratory, cognitive, and functional symptoms were assessed by telephone with 
      the Q3PC cognitive screening questionnaire and a checklist of symptoms. At the 
      ambulatory care visit, patients underwent pulmonary function tests, lung computed 
      tomographic scan, psychometric and cognitive tests (including the 36-Item 
      Short-Form Health Survey and 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), and, 
      for patients who had been hospitalized in the ICU or reported ongoing symptoms, 
      echocardiography. RESULTS: Among 834 eligible patients, 478 were evaluated by 
      telephone (mean age, 61 years [SD, 16 years]; 201 men, 277 women). During the 
      telephone interview, 244 patients (51%) declared at least 1 symptom that did not 
      exist before COVID-19: fatigue in 31%, cognitive symptoms in 21%, and new-onset 
      dyspnea in 16%. There was further evaluation in 177 patients (37%), including 97 
      of 142 former ICU patients. The median 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory 
      score (n = 130) was 4.5 (interquartile range, 3.0-5.0) for reduced motivation and 
      3.7 (interquartile range, 3.0-4.5) for mental fatigue (possible range, 1 [best] 
      to 5 [worst]). The median 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey score (n = 145) was 25 
      (interquartile range, 25.0-75.0) for the subscale "role limited owing to physical 
      problems" (possible range, 0 [best] to 100 [worst]). Computed tomographic 
      lung-scan abnormalities were found in 108 of 171 patients (63%), mainly subtle 
      ground-glass opacities. Fibrotic lesions were observed in 33 of 171 patients 
      (19%), involving less than 25% of parenchyma in all but 1 patient. Fibrotic 
      lesions were observed in 19 of 49 survivors (39%) with acute respiratory distress 
      syndrome. Among 94 former ICU patients, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic 
      symptoms were observed in 23%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The left ventricular 
      ejection fraction was less than 50% in 8 of 83 ICU patients (10%). New-onset 
      chronic kidney disease was observed in 2 ICU patients. Serology was positive in 
      172 of 177 outpatients (97%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Four months after 
      hospitalization for COVID-19, a cohort of patients frequently reported symptoms 
      not previously present, and lung-scan abnormalities were common among those who 
      were tested. These findings are limited by the absence of a control group and of 
      pre-COVID assessments in this cohort. Further research is needed to understand 
      longer-term outcomes and whether these findings reflect associations with the 
      disease.

PG  - 162-168
LID - 10.1177/0891988720915515 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment is frequently comorbid with late-life depression 
      (LLD) and often persists despite remission of mood symptoms with antidepressant 
      treatment. Increasing understanding of factors that predict improvement of 
      cognitive symptoms in LLD is useful to inform treatment recommendations. METHODS: 
      We used data from 2 randomized clinical trials of geriatric depression to examine 
      the relationships between sociodemographic factors (resilience, quality of life) 
      and clinical factors (age of depression onset, severity of depression, apathy) 
      with subsequent cognitive outcomes. One hundred sixty-five older adults with 
      major depression who had completed one of 2 clinical trials were included: (1) 
      methylphenidate plus placebo, citalopram plus placebo, and citalopram plus 
      methylphenidate or (2) citalopram combined with Tai Chi or health education. A 
      comprehensive neuropsychiatric battery was administered; 2 measures of cognitive 
      improvement were examined, one defined as an increase in general cognitive 
      performance score of at least 1 standard deviation and the other 0.5 standard 
      deviation pre-post treatment. RESULTS: At posttreatment, 59% of participants had 
      remitted, but less than a third of those who remitted showed cognitive 
      improvement (29%). Cognitive improvement was observed in 18% of nonremitters. 
      Lower baseline depression severity, greater social functioning, and depression 
      onset prior to 60 years of age were significantly associated with cognitive 
      improvement. None of the other measures, including baseline apathy, resilience, 
      and depression remission status, were significantly associated with cognitive 
      improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Lower severity of depression, earlier onset, and 
      greater social functioning may predict improvement in cognitive functioning with 
      treatment for depression in LLD.

TI  - Comparability of social anhedonia across epidemiological dimensions: A 
      multinational study of measurement invariance of the Revised Social Anhedonia 
      Scale.
PG  - 171-179
LID - 10.1037/pas0000972 [doi]
AB  - Social anhedonia, or the loss of motivation in and pleasure from social 
      engagement, is an important feature in understanding the etiology and outcome of 
      various psychopathologies. While the Revised Social Anhedonia Scale (RSAS) 
      represents one of the most commonly used self-report measures of social 
      anhedonia, little is known regarding the construct comparability across 
      populations. We examined measurement invariance of the full and brief RSAS in a 
      diverse, international sample of 14,064 participants across nine epidemiological 
      dimensions, including gender, age, ethnicity, education, community income, 
      continent, migrant status, ethnic density, and urbanicity. Both the full and 
      brief RSAS, as represented by a three-factor structure, achieved metric 
      invariance for all dimensions. The full version showed considerable scalar 
      noninvariance for ethnicity and continent, which was significantly reduced in the 
      brief version. These findings suggest that while the scales measure the same 
      construct across diverse groups, mean comparisons are only appropriate for the 
      brief, and not the full, version. Future research may consider using the brief 
      RSAS to ensure cross-national comparability. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021

TI  - Clinical Phenotypes of Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia by Age at 
      Onset.
PG  - 381-390
LID - 10.3233/JAD-210179 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is generally 
      considered a young-onset dementia, although age at onset is highly variable. 
      While several studies indicate clinical differences regarding age at onset, no 
      biomarker validated cohort studies with updated clinical criteria have been 
      performed. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine behavior, cognition, and mortality over 
      the full age spectrum in a cohort of bvFTD patients with neuroimaging, genetic, 
      or histopathological confirmation and exclusion of positive Alzheimer's disease 
      biomarkers or severe cerebrovascular damage. METHODS: In total, 315 patients with 
      a clinical diagnosis of probable or definite bvFTD were included from the 
      Amsterdam Dementia Cohort and grouped into quartiles by age-at-diagnosis. 
      Neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive functioning were assessed with the 
      neuropsychiatric inventory, the geriatric depression scale and a 
      neuropsychological test battery. Data on mortality was obtained from the Dutch 
      municipal register. Associations between age-at-diagnosis and clinical features 
      and mortality risk were examined. RESULTS: Age-at-diagnosis ranged from 26 to 85 
      years and established quartiles with mean ages of 52±6, 61±2, 66±2, and 74±3 
      years. In the total sample, 44.4%exceeded an age of 65 years at time of 
      diagnosis. Earlier age-at-diagnosis was associated with more severe behavioral 
      symptoms, while later age-at-diagnosis was associated with more severe memory 
      impairment. Unexpectedly, mortality risk was not associated with 
      age-at-diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In bvFTD, symptom profile is associated with 
      age-at-diagnosis. This should be taken into account with regard to diagnostics, 
      patient management, and trial design. Additionally, based on our sample, the 
      prevalence of late-onset bvFTD is higher than generally thought.

TI  - Apathy Measures in Older Adults and People with Dementia: A Systematic Review of 
      Measurement Properties Using the COSMIN Methodology.
PG  - 111-123
LID - 10.1159/000515678 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is highly prevalent in dementia and is also seen in mild 
      cognitive impairment and the general population. Apathy contributes to failure to 
      undertake daily activities and can lead to health problems or crises. It is 
      therefore important to assess apathy. However, there is currently no gold 
      standard measure of apathy. A comprehensive systematic review of the measurement 
      properties of apathy scales is required. METHODS: A systematic review was 
      registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42018094390). MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and 
      CINAHL were searched for studies that aimed to develop or assess the validity or 
      reliability of an apathy scale in participants over 65 years, living in the 
      community. A systematic review was conducted in line with the COnsensus-based 
      Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments procedure for 
      reviewing patient-reported outcome measures. The studies' risk of bias was 
      assessed, and all relevant measurement properties were assessed for quality. 
      Results were pooled and rated using a modified Grading of Recommendations 
      Assessment, Development, and Evaluation procedure. RESULTS: Fifty-seven 
      publications regarding 18 measures and 39 variations met the eligibility 
      criteria. The methodological quality of individual studies ranged from inadequate 
      to very good and measurement properties ranged from insufficient to sufficient. 
      Similarly, the overall evidence for measurement properties ranged from very low 
      to high quality. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) and Lille Apathy Rating Scale 
      (LARS) had sufficient content validity, reliability, construct validity, and 
      where applicable, structural validity and internal consistency. CONCLUSION: 
      Numerous scales are available to assess apathy, with varying psychometric 
      properties. The AES and LARS are recommended for measuring apathy in older adults 
      and people living with dementia. The apathy dimension of the commonly used 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory should be limited to screening for apathy.

TI  - Improving the Diagnosis of the Frontal Variant of Alzheimer's Disease with the 
      DAPHNE Scale.
PG  - 1735-1745
LID - 10.3233/JAD-201088 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The frontal variant of Alzheimer's disease (fAD) is poorly understood 
      and poorly defined. The diagnosis remains challenging. The main differential 
      diagnosis is the behavioral variant of frontotemporal degeneration (bvFTD). For 
      fAD, there is some dissociation between the clinical frontal presentation and 
      imaging and neuropathological studies, which do not always find a specific 
      involvement of the frontal lobes. DAPHNE is a behavioral scale, which 
      demonstrated excellent performance to distinguish between bvFTD and AD. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the reliability of this new 
      tool to improve the clinical diagnosis of fAD. METHODS: Twenty fAD patients and 
      their caregivers were prospectively included and were compared with 36 bvFTD and 
      22 AD patients. RESULTS: The three main behavioral disorders in the fAD patients 
      were apathy, loss of empathy, and disinhibition. Three disorders were 
      discriminant because they were less frequent and less severe in the fAD patients 
      than in the bvFTD patients, namely hyperorality, neglect, and perseverations. 
      This specific pattern of behavioral disorders was corroborated by SPECT or 18FDG 
      PET-CT scan that showed that patients with fAD could have a medial frontal 
      hypoperfusion, whereas in bvFTD patients the orbitofrontal cortex was the main 
      involved region, with more diffuse hypoperfusion. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated 
      that DAPHNE had good sensitivity and good specificity to discriminate between the 
      three groups and in particular between fAD and bvFTD patients. DAPHNE is a quick 
      tool that could help clinicians in memory clinics not only to differentiate bvFTD 
      from typical AD but also from fAD.

TI  - Functional reserve: The residual variance in instrumental activities of daily 
      living not explained by brain structure, cognition, and demographics.
PG  - 19-32
LID - 10.1037/neu0000705 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cognitive reserve is a concept that explains individual differences in 
      resilience to brain pathology and susceptibility to poor late-life cognitive 
      outcomes. We evaluate the analogous concept of "Functional Reserve," defined as 
      the difference between observed functional abilities and those predicted by brain 
      structure, cognitive performance, and demographics. This study aims to validate 
      the construct of functional reserve by testing its utility in predicting clinical 
      outcomes and exploring its predictors. METHOD: Longitudinal data collected 
      annually for up to 7 years from 1,084 older adults (ndementia = 163; nMCI = 333; 
      nCN = 523) were analyzed. Functional reserve was operationalized as the residual 
      variance in the Lawton-Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale 
      after accounting for demographics (sex/gender, race, ethnicity, education), 
      neuropathology (gray matter, hippocampal, and white matter hyperintensity 
      volumes), and cognition (executive function, verbal episodic memory, semantic 
      memory, and spatial function). Structural equation models estimated (a) 
      functional reserve's associations with 7-year changes in clinical diagnosis and 
      disease severity and (b) predictors of functional reserve. RESULTS: Functional 
      reserve was lower in dementia versus cognitively normal individuals. Higher 
      baseline functional reserve was associated with lower concurrent dementia 
      severity and slower clinical progression and attenuated the association of 
      cognition with concurrent dementia severity. Physical function and apathy were 
      the strongest predictors of functional reserve. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide 
      preliminary validation of functional reserve for explaining individual 
      differences in susceptibility to IADL dysfunction independent of neuropathology, 
      cognition, and demographics. Physical functioning and apathy are promising 
      modifiable intervention targets to enhance functional reserve in the context of 
      brain atrophy and cognitive decline. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all

TI  - Cognitive and emotional symptoms in patients with first-ever mild stroke: The 
      syndrome of hidden impairments.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of cognitive and emotional impairments one 
      year after first-ever mild stroke in younger patients Design: Prospective, 
      observational, cohort study. SUBJECTS: A consecutive sample of 117 previously 
      cognitively healthy patients aged 18-70 years with mild stroke (National 
      Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≤ 3) were included in 2 hospitals in 
      Norway during a 2-year period. METHODS: At 12-month follow-up, patients were 
      assessed using validated instruments for essential cognitive domains, fatigue, 
      depression, anxiety, apathy and pathological laughter and crying. RESULTS: In 
      total, 78 patients (67%) had difficulty with one or a combination of the 
      cognitive domains psychomotor speed, attention, executive and visuospatial 
      function, and memory. Furthermore, 50 patients (43%) had impairment in either one 
      or a combination of the emotional measures for anxiety, depressive symptoms, 
      fatigue, apathy or emotional lability. A total of 32 patients (28%) had both 
      cognitive and emotional impairments. Only 21 patients (18%) scored within the 
      reference range in all the cognitive and emotional tools. CONCLUSION: Hidden 
      impairments are common after first-ever mild stroke in younger patients. Stroke 
      physicians should screen for hidden impairments using appropriate tools.

TI  - Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms that Predict Cognitive Decline or 
      Impairment in Cognitively Normal Middle-Aged or Older Adults: a Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 558-579
LID - 10.1007/s11065-020-09437-5 [doi]
AB  - Epidemiological studies have revealed that behavioral and psychological (or 
      non-cognitive) symptoms are risk factors for cognitive decline in older adults. 
      This study aimed to systematically review the literature and determine which 
      behavioral and psychological symptoms are most predictive of future cognitive 
      decline among individuals with no pre-existing cognitive impairments. The 
      selected studies included middle-aged or older adults without cognitive 
      impairments. The predictors were assessed using behavioral and psychological 
      questionnaires, or diagnostic interviews, to identify non-cognitive symptoms or 
      psychiatric clinical conditions. The follow-up period was at least one year, and 
      the design of the selected studies was either retrospective or prospective. This 
      study compared individuals with and without non-cognitive manifestations and 
      resulted in one of three outcomes: (a) a score change on a cognitive measure, (b) 
      a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, or (c) a diagnosis of Alzheimer's 
      disease or dementia. Four online databases were searched for eligible studies 
      from the database inception to January 17, 2017: MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (OVID), 
      PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Pooled effect sizes were estimated using a 
      random-effect model. Higgins I(2), the Q statistic, and tau-squared were used to 
      quantify the observed heterogeneity between the studies. Results indicate that 
      depression and sleep duration (long and short) were the most consistent 
      associations between behavioral or psychological symptoms and cognitive decline. 
      This meta-analysis supports the need to assess behavioral and psychological 
      symptoms in cognitively intact older adults to identify those who are at risk for 
      cognitive decline.

AB  - Stroke survivors majorly suffered from post-stroke depression (PSD). The PSD 
      diagnosis is commonly performed based on the clinical cut-off for psychometric 
      inventories. However, we hypothesized that PSD involves spectrum symptoms (e.g., 
      apathy, depression, anxiety, and stress domains) and severity levels. Therefore, 
      instead of using the clinical cut-off, we suggested a data-driven analysis to 
      interpret patient spectrum conditions. The patients' psychological conditions 
      were categorized in an unsupervised manner using the k-means clustering method, 
      and the relationships between psychological conditions and quantitative lesion 
      degrees were evaluated. This study involved one hundred sixty-five patient data; 
      all patients were able to understand and perform self-rating psychological 
      conditions (i.e., no aphasia). Four severity levels-low, low-to-moderate, 
      moderate-to-high, and high-were observed for each combination of two 
      psychological domains. Patients with worse conditions showed the significantly 
      greater lesion degree at the right Rolandic operculum (part of Brodmann area 43). 
      The dissimilarities between stress and other domains were also suggested. 
      Patients with high stress were specifically associated with lesions in the left 
      thalamus. Impaired emotion processing and stress-affected functions have been 
      frequently related to those lesion regions. Those lesions were also robust and 
      localized, suggesting the possibility of an objective for predicting 
      psychological conditions from brain lesions.

AB  - Background: Geriatric depression with subjective memory complaints increases the 
      risk for Alzheimer's Disease. Memantine, a neuroprotective drug, can improve 
      depression and help prevent cognitive decline. In our 6-months clinical trial, 
      escitalopram/memantine (ESC/MEM) improved mood and cognition compared to 
      escitalopram/placebo treatment (ESC/PBO; NCT01902004). In this report, we 
      investigated whether baseline brain white matter integrity in 
      fronto-limbic-striatal tracts can predict clinical outcomes using fractional 
      anisotropy (FA). Methods: Thirty-eight older depressed adults (mean age = 70.6, 
      SD = 7.2) were randomized to ESC/MEM or ESC/PBO and underwent diffusion-weighted 
      imaging (DWI) at 3 Tesla at baseline. Mood was assessed using the Hamilton 
      Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), apathy using the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) 
      and anxiety using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) at baseline and 6-months 
      follow-up. FA was extracted from seven tracts of interest (six in each hemisphere 
      and one commissural tract) associated with geriatric depression. Non-parametric 
      General Linear Models were used to examine group differences in the association 
      between FA and symptom improvement, controlling for age, sex, baseline symptom 
      scores and scanner model, correcting for false discovery rate (FDR). Post-hoc 
      tests further investigated group differences in axial, mean and radial 
      diffusivity (AD, MD, and RD, respectively). Lastly, we performed an exploratory 
      whole-brain model to test whether FA might be related to treatment response with 
      memantine. Results: There were no differences in remission rates or HAMD change 
      between groups. In bilateral anterior and posterior internal capsule tracts and 
      bilateral inferior and right superior fronto-occipital (IFO and SFO) fasciculus, 
      higher FA was associated with larger improvements in depressive symptoms for 
      ESC/MEM, but not ESC/PBO, correcting for FDR. Lower MD in the left IFO and RD in 
      the right anterior internal capsule were associated with improved treatment 
      responses. We found no significant associations in the whole-brain analysis. 
      Limitations: Included small sample size and high dropout. Conclusions: Higher 
      baseline FA and lower RD and MD in hypothesized fronto-limbic-striatal tracts 
      predicted greater improvement in mood and anxiety with ESC/MEM compared to 
      ESC/PBO in geriatric depression. FA as a biomarker for white matter integrity may 
      serve as a predictor of treatment response but requires confirmation in larger 
      future studies.

TI  - Mental Health Status of Psychogeriatric Patients During the 2019 New Coronavirus 
      Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic and Effects on Caregiver Burden.
PG  - 578672

AB  - Introduction: There is a growing awareness about the noxious effects of the 2019 
      Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental health of the elderly. 
      However, there is limited information from clinically driven research. The 
      objectives of the present study were to examine the magnitude of psychiatric 
      symptoms and to determine their association with caregiver distress, in a 
      cross-section of community-dwelling older adults and a subsample of aging adults 
      with Down syndrome (DS) attending a psychogeriatric service in São Paulo, Brazil. 
      Method: Telephone-based interviews and electronically filled self-assessment 
      questionnaires were used to collect information from patients and caregivers, 
      addressing their impressions and concerns about the pandemic and related effects 
      on the patient's emotional state and behavior. Clinical information was obtained 
      from hospital charts, medical records, and psychometric tests administered 
      through telephone interviews [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q)]. Results: We included 100 
      consecutive participants, comprising 71 older adults with 
      psychogeriatric/neurocognitive disorders and 29 aging adults with DS. Higher HADS 
      and NPI-Q scores were significantly associated with caregiver distress (p < 0.05) 
      in both groups. Correlation analyses indicated strong, positive associations 
      between caregiver burden and scores in HADS anxiety (HADS-A) and HADS depression 
      (HADS-D) scales in the subsamples of euploid and DS subjects. Higher NPI-Q scores 
      in the former group were also correlated with caregiver distress, with stronger 
      associations for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Similar findings were observed among 
      DS subjects. ANOVA tests indicated significant associations between NPI-Q scores 
      and caregiver distress among dementia patients, as well as with HADS scores. 
      Similar results were found after multiple linear regressions; as such, among the 
      elderly subsample, higher scores in HADS-A (p = 0.002) and HADS-D (p = 0.001) 
      predict a significant impact on caregiver burden (p < 0.00001, R (2) 0.46); 
      taking into consideration caregiver burden as a dependent variable and NPI-Q 
      total score as an independent variable, we obtained significant strong prediction 
      values for either DS (p < 0.00001, R (2) 0.95) or elderly adults (p < 0.00001, R 
      (2) 0.88). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with neurocognitive 
      disorders present with clinically relevant neuropsychiatric symptoms, with 
      significant impact on caregiver distress. Apathy, aberrant motor behavior, sleep 
      disorders, and psychoses were the main psychopathological domains, which had 
      determined caregiver burden worsening.

AB  - Apathy is a disease characterized by diminished motivation not attributable to a 
      diminished level of consciousness, cognitive impairment, or emotional distress. 
      It is a serious problem facing the elderly in today's society. The diagnosis of 
      apathy needs to be done at a clinic, which is particularly inconvenient and 
      difficult for elderly patients. In this work, we examine the possibility of using 
      doppler radar imaging for the classification of apathy in the elderly. We 
      recruited 178 elderly participants to help create a dataset by having them fill 
      out a questionnaire and submit to doppler radar imaging while performing a 
      walking action. We selected walking because it is one of the most common actions 
      in daily life and potentially contains a variety of useful health information. We 
      used radar imaging rather than an RGB camera due to the greater privacy 
      protection it affords. Seven machine learning models, including our proposed one, 
      which uses a neural network, were applied to apathy classification using the 
      walking doppler radar images of the elderly. Before classification, we perform a 
      simple image pre-processing for feature extraction. This pre-processing separates 
      every walking doppler radar image into four parts on the vertical and horizontal 
      axes and the number of feature points is then counted in every separated part 
      after binarization to create eight features. In this binarization, the optimized 
      threshold is obtained by experimentally sliding the threshold. We found that our 
      proposed neural network achieved an accuracy of more than 75% in apathy 
      classification. This accuracy is not as high as that of other object 
      classification methods in current use, but as an initial research in this area, 
      it demonstrates the potential of apathy classification using doppler radar images 
      for the elderly. We will examine ways of increasing the accuracy in future work.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Implantation of an inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) has high 
      success and satisfaction rates, but there remains a paucity of evidence examining 
      non-usage of IPP and reasons for discontinuation. AIM: To identify how frequent 
      patients use their prosthesis and their personal reasons for no longer using it. 
      METHODS: We conducted a survey of all patients who underwent an IPP implantation 
      by a single surgeon over a 6-year period, between 2012 and 2018. After 
      application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 114 patients formed 
      the final cohort. Patients were initially surveyed via mail with a questionnaire; 
      those who did not respond were surveyed via telephone. The factors determining 
      patient selection for IPP implantation included suitability for general 
      anesthesia, manual dexterity to use the device by the patient or their partner on 
      a demonstration device, and presence of refractory erectile dysfunction, HbA1C 
      lower than 8.5, or need for a revision of a previously placed IPP. Universally, a 
      3-piece AMS 700 Series implant was placed via the penoscrotal approach. Data were 
      analyzed with Pearson chi square test, and survivability of the device was 
      assessed with Kaplan-Meier survival curve. OUTCOMES: The main outcomes of this 
      study are the frequency of IPP usage and reasons for discontinuation. RESULTS: 
      The survey participation rate was 97%. The mean age of patient was 64 years 
      (range 34-83 years), and the mean time between surgery and completion of survey 
      was 2.98 years (range 0.25-7.4 years). Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrated that 68% 
      of the patients were using the IPP at 5 years after implantation. Using the age 
      70 years as a cutoff, 18 (22%) patients younger than 70 years and 14 (42%) 
      patients older than 70 years discontinued using the IPP (P = .029). The commonest 
      reasons for discontinuation were poor health to engage in sexual activity (2.6%), 
      loss of companion (19%), loss of interest in sex (2.6%), and device malfunction 
      with no further interest in revision of prosthesis (14%). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
      The clinical implication of this study was improved patient selection for device 
      implantation. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: To our knowledge, no other study has 
      investigated reasons for patients no longer using their prosthesis. Our study has 
      several limitations including that it is a cross-sectional analysis, our survey 
      is not validated, this is a single-surgeon experience, we have a small sample 
      size, and we did not differentiate between virgin implant and reimplantation. 
      CONCLUSION: Our study shows a high rate (28%) of non-usage of IPP, more so in men 
      older than the age of 70 years in the first 5 years of implantation. Knoll P, Rai

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The early recognition and management of the behavioral and 
      psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are important to inform treatment 
      decisions. Current BPSD screening tools are time-consuming and require advanced 
      skills, limiting their application in routine clinical practice. An easier and 
      quicker tool for use by nonphysician healthcare personnel is needed. METHODS: A 
      14-item, Thai-language, BPSD scoring system for dementia (BPSD-T) was developed, 
      based on clinical surveys and modifications after a pilot study. The 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), BPSD-T, Thai Mental State Examination (TMSE), 
      Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), and Barthel Index were performed. BPSD-T 
      and NPI scores were compared, and test validity and reliability were analyzed. 
      RESULTS: A total of 168 people with dementia (mean age, 80.7 ± 6.7 years) and 
      their primary caregivers were recruited. A total of 105 (62.5%) subjects were 
      diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 31 (18.5%) with AD with small-vessel 
      disease. The Global CDR was 0.5-1 for 73.8% of subjects, and 2-3 for 26.2%. The 
      BPSD-T content validity index was 0.80-0.98, with high inter-rater and 
      test-retest reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis showed the goodness of fit 
      of 5 clusters of BPSD-T included a psychomotor syndrome (aggression, 
      irritability, delusions, insomnia), an affective syndrome (apathy, repeating, 
      anxiety, depression), a psychosis syndrome (misidentification, hallucinations), a 
      behavior syndrome (hoarding, rummaging, wandering), and a euphoria syndrome 
      (euphoria). Convergent validity showed a high correlation of the frequency score 
      (r = 0.66) and caregiver distress score (r = 0.76) with the NPI. The BPSD-T score 
      was significantly higher with more severe dementia. The average completion time 
      for the BPSD-T (230.9 ± 65.5 s) was significantly less than that for NPI 
      (506 ± 196.9 s; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: BPSD-T is a quick, reliable, and valid 
      test to evaluate BPSD from the common dementia subtypes and severity, with a good 
      correlation with the NPI. Its application in routine clinical practice will 
      enable earlier recognition, targeted intervention, improved quality of care, and 
      reduced caregiver burden.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The distress thermometer (DT) is an effective tool for identifying 
      distress among cancer patients worldwide. However, DT has not been studied in 
      Egyptian patients. We aimed to study the prevalence of distress among Egyptian 
      patients with different types of cancers using DT. METHODS: A total of 550 
      patients with newly diagnosed hematological and solid cancers who were followed 
      up at 3 Oncology Centers in Egypt were enrolled. They completed a 
      sociodemographic and clinical status questionnaire, the DT and the Problem List 
      (PL) scale. RESULTS: At a DT cut-off score of ≥4, 46% of patients had significant 
      distress, which was related to the tumor site and stage. The most frequent 
      problems reported were treatment decision (64.4%), worry (47%), and fears 
      (44.5%). In univariate logistic regression analysis, participants who had 
      significant distress described 23 out of 36 problems in the practical, family, 
      emotional, and physical areas. After adjustment to sociodemographic and clinical 
      characteristics, multivariable analysis confirmed that insurance, depression, 
      fear, sadness, worry, loss of interest in usual activity, and sleep were 
      independent factors associated with significant distress in cancer patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of Egyptian patients newly diagnosed with cancer 
      reported significant distress. Those who had significant distress described extra 
      problems in the practical, family, emotional, and physical areas. We recommend 
      the routine use of DT for screening Egyptian patients with cancer, as well as the 
      involvement of the psycho-oncology and social services, at the time of their 
      initial diagnosis.

AB  - Aim: To adapt, translate, and utilize the Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) in 
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) to the Spanish population. Method: We 
      recruited 104 ALS patients (67 of their caregivers) and 49 controls. Participants 
      completed the Spanish-translated DAS, Geriatric Depression Scale- Short form. 
      Patients were also administered the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised 
      (ALSFRS-R). Caregivers additionally completed the informant/caregiver-rated 
      Spanish-translated DAS. The DAS was translated to Spanish using a 
      back-translation method. Test-retest and internal consistency reliability were 
      examined. Divergent validity was assessed by comparing the DAS with the 
      depression scale (GDS-15). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to 
      explore the substructure of the Spanish DAS. Results: The internal consistency 
      reliability of self-rated Spanish DAS was 0.72 and of the 
      informant/caregiver-rated Spanish DAS was 0.84. Correlations between self-rated 
      DAS subscales and GDS-15 were not statistically significant, with a good 
      test-retest reliability. PCA analysis showed a similar substructure to the 
      original DAS. ALS patients had significantly higher Initiation apathy than 
      controls. Additionally, ALS patient informant/caregiver-rated DAS Emotional 
      apathy was significantly higher than the self-rated, with no significant 
      differences observed in the Executive and Initiation subscales. No association 
      was found between DAS and functional impairment using the ALS Functional Rating 
      Scale (ALSFRS-R). Conclusion: The Spanish translation of the DAS is valid and 
      reliable for use in assessing multidimensional apathy in the Spanish population. 
      Availability of the Spanish DAS will allow for future research to explore 
      different apathy subtypes and their impact in ALS and other conditions.

TI  - The suicide crisis syndrome: A network analysis.
PG  - 595-607
LID - 10.1037/cou0000423 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies introduced the suicide crisis syndrome (SCS), a condition 
      associated with imminent suicidal behavior and characterized by (a) a pervasive 
      feeling of entrapment in which the escape from an unbearable life situation is 
      perceived as both urgent and impossible (Criterion A) and (b) affective 
      disturbance, loss of cognitive control, hyperarousal, and social withdrawal 
      (Criterion B). The goal of the present study was to use some of the analytic 
      tools provided by network analyses to further the understanding of the 
      psychological, emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and physiological processes 
      involved in the SCS by testing (a) whether the different symptoms of the proposed 
      syndrome are related to each other, (b) whether symptoms form meaningful 
      clusters, and (c) whether certain symptoms are more central than others. The 
      study included 500 outpatient and 223 inpatient participants. A network analysis 
      of the participants' scores on the various symptoms of the SCS was conducted. The 
      network analysis suggested that most SCS symptoms are linked by strong 
      connections and that entrapment and ruminative flooding are highly correlated 
      with the other SCS symptoms. Three clusters of symptoms were identified, 
      suggesting the existence of several interdependent psychological processes 
      potentially involved in SCS phenomenology. Our findings support both the 
      suggested symptoms of the SCS and the central role of entrapment in the proposed 
      criteria for the syndrome. Emotional pain appears to be closely linked to 
      entrapment and may belong in Criterion A. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA,

TI  - White matter hyperintensities: a marker for apathy in Parkinson's disease without 
      dementia?
PG  - 1692-1701
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51159 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between 
      white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and the occurrence and progression of apathy 
      in Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: We recruited patients with PD who underwent 
      baseline evaluation, which included apathy assessment and magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) head scans. After 2.5 years of follow-up, we re-evaluated patient 
      apathy symptoms. The severity and location of WMH were assessed with 
      fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences using the Fazekas visual 
      rating scale. Logistic regression and linear regression analyses of baseline WMH 
      characteristics were conducted to explore the potential association between 
      apathy and WMH. RESULTS: A total of 141 PD patients were recruited. The apathy 
      group had a higher proportion of male patients, advanced disease, and depression, 
      which was coupled with a lower quality of life. Morever, higher WMH severity was 
      significantly associated with apathy. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated 
      that WMH severity was a risk factor for apathy. In addition, linear regression 
      analysis also suggests that apathy severity is positively correlated with 
      baseline WMH Fazekas scales (ϐ = 0.959, P < 0.001). Baseline WMH severity was 
      also a risk factor for apathy progression. INTERPRETATION: WMH is associated with 
      apathy and could be a promising marker to predict apathy progression in PD.

TI  - Patient-reported outcomes in maintenance hemodialysis: a cross-sectional, 
      multicenter study.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to assess patient-reported outcome measures 
      (PROMs) related to symptoms among maintenance hemodialysis patients (MHDp). 
      METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between 2013 and 2015, with 336 
      MHDp from five hospital hemodialysis units. It included a comprehensive 
      assessment of the prevalence and intensity of 30 common dialysis-related symptoms 
      quality of life and daily function of MHDp, by using the Dialysis Symptom Index 
      (DSI), Quality of Life Short Form (KDQOL-SF), and demographic and clinical 
      characteristics. RESULTS: The five most commonly reported symptoms were 
      identified as tiredness (80%), difficulty becoming sexually aroused (72%), 
      decreased interest in sex (72%), worrying (67%), trouble staying asleep (65%), 
      and trouble falling asleep (64%). Based on the DSI, the mean Overall Burden of 
      Symptoms (OBS), on a scale of 0-30, was 15.4 ± 6.7, while the mean Overall 
      Symptom Severity Score (OSSS), on a scale of 0-150, was 54.8 ± 29.8. Multivariate 
      quantile regression models indicated that major depression is consistently 
      associated with both the OBS and OSSS across different quantiles, whereas time on 
      dialysis > 24 months was associated with the OBS only. Both the OBS and OSSS were 
      inversely associated with KDQOL-SF: the kidney-related (KDCS), physical (PCS) and 
      mental aspects (MCS), across multiple quantiles in multivariate quantile 
      regression models. CONCLUSIONS: MHDp bear a heavy burden of symptom which are 
      associated with time spent on dialysis as well as depression. Clinical and 
      research resources should be directed at controlling symptoms, improving daily 
      function, detecting depression, and bettering quality of life.

TI  - Parkinson disease clinical subtypes: key features & clinical milestones.
PG  - 1272-1283
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51102 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Based on multi-domain classification of Parkinson disease (PD) 
      subtypes, we sought to determine the key features that best differentiate 
      subtypes and the utility of PD subtypes to predict clinical milestones. METHODS: 
      Prospective cohort of 162 PD participants with ongoing, longitudinal follow-up. 
      Latent class analysis (LCA) delineated subtypes based on score patterns across 
      baseline motor, cognitive, and psychiatric measures. Discriminant analyses 
      identified key features that distinguish subtypes at baseline. Cox regression 
      models tested PD subtype differences in longitudinal conversion to clinical 
      milestones, including deep brain stimulation (DBS), dementia, and mortality. 
      RESULTS: LCA identified distinct subtypes: "motor only" (N = 63) characterized by 
      primary motor deficits; "psychiatric & motor" (N = 17) characterized by prominent 
      psychiatric symptoms and moderate motor deficits; "cognitive & motor" (N = 82) 
      characterized by impaired cognition and moderate motor deficits. Depression, 
      executive function, and apathy best discriminated subtypes. Since enrollment, 22 
      had DBS, 48 developed dementia, and 46 have died. Although there were no subtype 
      differences in rate of DBS, dementia occurred at a higher rate in the "cognitive 
      & motor" subtype. Surprisingly, mortality risk was similarly elevated for both 
      "cognitive & motor" and "psychiatric & motor" subtypes compared to the "motor 
      only" subtype (relative risk = 3.15, 2.60). INTERPRETATION: Psychiatric and 
      cognitive features, rather than motor deficits, distinguish clinical PD subtypes 
      and predict greater risk of subsequent dementia and mortality. These results 
      emphasize the value of multi-domain assessments to better characterize clinical 
      variability in PD. Further, differences in dementia and mortality rates 
      demonstrate the prognostic utility of PD subtypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, Mullen et al. (2011) presented an 8-item version of the 
      Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) that provides a valid instrument for 
      assessing enjoyment in physical activity. The present paper investigated the 
      psychometric properties of a Portuguese adaptation of PACES. METHODS: After a 
      process of back-to-back translation into Portuguese, 395 members of fitness 
      centers who ranged in age from 18 to 66 years (31.11 ± 8.90, mean ± SD) completed 
      the translated version of the PACES. On average, participants had 3.2 years of 
      experience in fitness group classes and practiced for approximately 3.3 times per 
      week. RESULTS: An initial exploratory factor analysis (n = 139) revealed a 
      unidimensional structure with factor loadings ranging from 0.79 to 0.89. Results 
      also showed acceptable internal consistency. A confirmatory factor analysis in an 
      independent sample (n = 256) provided additional support for the unidimensional 
      structure of the questionnaire. In addition, moderate positive correlations 
      between enjoyment and intrinsic and identified regulation, and moderate negative 
      correlations between enjoyment and external and amotivation, demonstrate the 
      convergent validity of the instrument. Finally, measurement invariance between 2 
      independent samples was also found. CONCLUSION: The 8-item Portuguese version of 
      PACES is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring enjoyment of physical 
      activity in Portuguese adult fitness exercisers, and it is therefore suitable to 
      use as a measure of affect in exercise adherence interventions studies.

TI  - The association of eating challenges with energy intake is moderated by the 
      mealtime environment in residential care homes.
PG  - 863-873
LID - 10.1017/S1041610219001959 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Given the increased risk of malnutrition in residential care homes, 
      we studied how specific aspects of the mealtime environment are associated with 
      residents' eating challenges and energy intake in general and dementia care units 
      of these homes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: 624 residents and 82 
      dining rooms. SETTING: 32 residential care homes across Canada. MEASUREMENTS: 
      Eating challenges were measured using the Edinburgh Feeding Evaluation in 
      Dementia Questionnaire (Ed-FED-q). Energy intake was estimated over nine meals. 
      Physical, social, person-centered, functional, and homelike aspects of the 
      mealtime environment were scored using standardized, valid measures. Effects of 
      interactions between dining environment scores and eating challenges on daily 
      energy intake were assessed using linear regression. RESULTS: More eating 
      challenges were associated with decreased energy intake on the general (β = 
      -36.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -47.8, -25.2) and dementia care units (β = 
      -19.9, 95% CI = -34.6, -5.2). Among residents living on general care units, the 
      functional (β = 48.5, 95% CI = 1.8, 95.2) and physical (β = 56.9, 95% CI = 7.2, 
      106.7) environment scores were positively and directly associated with energy 
      intake; the social and person-centered aspects of the mealtime environment 
      moderated the relationship between eating challenges and energy intake. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Resident eating challenges were significantly associated with energy 
      intake on both dementia care and general care units; however on general care 
      units, when adjusting for eating challenges, the functional and physical aspects 
      of the environment also had a direct effect on energy intake. Furthermore, the 
      social and person-centered aspects of the dining environment on general care 
      units moderated the relationship between eating challenges and energy intake. 
      Dementia care unit environments had no measurable effect on the association 
      between resident eating challenges and energy intake.

TI  - Health care use and treatment-seeking for depression symptoms in rural India: an

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a large "treatment gap" for depression worldwide. This study 
      aimed to better understand the treatment gap in rural India by describing health 
      care use and treatment-seeking for depression. METHODS: Data were analysed from a 
      two round cross-sectional community survey conducted in rural Madhya Pradesh 
      between May 2013 and December 2016. We examined the proportion of individuals who 
      screened positive for depression (≥10) on the Patient Health Questionnaire 
      (PHQ-9) who sought treatment in different sectors, for depression symptoms and 
      for any reason, and compared the latter with health service use by 
      screen-negative individuals. We analysed the frequency with which barriers to 
      healthcare utilisation were reported by screen-positive adults. We also analysed 
      the association between seeking treatment for depression and various 
      predisposing, enabling and need factors using univariable regression. RESULTS: 
      86% of screen-positive adults reported seeking no depression treatment. However, 
      66% had used health services for any reason in the past 3 months, compared to 46% 
      of screen-negative individuals (p < 0.0001). Private providers were most 
      frequently consulted by screen-positive adults (32%), while only 19% consulted 
      traditional providers. Structural barriers to healthcare use such as cost and 
      distance to services were frequently reported (54 and 52%, respectively) but were 
      not associated with treatment-seeking for depression. The following factors were 
      found to be positively associated with treatment-seeking for depression: higher 
      symptom severity; lack of energy, lack of interest/pleasure, low self-esteem, or 
      slow movements/restlessness on more than 7 days in the past 2 weeks; being 
      married; having discussed depression symptoms; and reporting problems with 
      medication availability and supply as a barrier to healthcare. No evidence was 
      found for an association between treatment-seeking for depression and most 
      socio-economic, demographic or attitudinal factors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      suggest that the majority of adults who screen positive for depression seek 
      healthcare, although not primarily for depression symptoms, indicating the need 
      to improve detection of depression during consultations about other complaints. 
      Private providers may need to be considered in programmes to improve depression 
      treatment in this setting. Further research should test the hypotheses generated 
      in this descriptive study, such as the potential role of marriage in facilitating 
      treatment-seeking.

TI  - The usefulness and prognostic value of Memorial Symptom Assessment-Short Form and 
      Condensed Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale in assessment of lung cancer 
      patients.
PG  - 2005-2014
LID - 10.1007/s00520-019-05003-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Lung cancer is associated with high level of symptoms and 
      patient-reported symptoms have been rarely used as a prognostic score to predict 
      patients survival. METHODS: Frequency and burden of symptoms in lung cancer 
      patients were evaluated before the diagnosis with the Memorial Symptom 
      Assessment-Short Form (MSAS-SF) and Condensed Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale 
      (CMSAS) questionnaires. Performance status, stage of disease, serum albumin, and 
      C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were recorded. Patients were staged according to 
      8th TNM classification. A survival analysis was applied. RESULTS: The mean age of 
      116 patients (adenocarcinoma 51, squamous cell 43, non-small cell 5, small cell 
      17) was 65.2 ± 10.1 (28-87) years. The most common seen physical and 
      psychological symptoms were cough (86.3%), lack of energy (74.3%), dyspnea 
      (70.1%), and feeling sad (61.5%), feeling nervous (61.5%), and worrying (53.8%). 
      Total and subscores of MSAS and CMSAS are significantly higher in M1 disease than 
      M0 disease. All MSAS-SF and CMSAS scores, but not MSAS-PSYCH and CMSAS-PSYCH, 
      positively correlated with age, high serum CRP, white blood cells/neutrophils 
      counts, and TNM stage, and negatively correlated with albumin levels, performance 
      status, and overall survival (OS). Median survival was 77, 195, 370, and 579 days 
      for the four prognostic interquartile groups according to CMSAS-SUM score 
      (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: MSAS-SF and CMSAS questionnaires can be useful tool for 
      discriminating metastatic from non-metastatic disease in treatment-naïve patients 
      with lung cancer. Since both questionnaires well correlated with OS and important 
      prognostic factors, they can use to plan palliative care and to help for 
      predicting survival of lung cancer patients.

TI  - Feasibility of the Audio Recorded Cognitive Screen in the Assessment of 
      Individuals Undergoing Electroconvulsive Therapy.
PG  - 4-9
LID - 10.1097/YCT.0000000000000637 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monitoring for cognitive deficits during a course of 
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is recommended, but cognitive assessment can be 
      time consuming. The Audio Recorded Cognitive Screen (ARCS) is a cognitive test 
      instrument with good psychometric properties that places minimal demands on 
      clinicians' time, but until now, it has not been formally evaluated for 
      monitoring cognition in the context of ECT treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study 
      aimed to assess the feasibility/utility of using the ARCS in the assessment of 
      depressed patients undergoing ECT. METHODS: Depressed patients undergoing ECT 
      were tested with the ARCS and a comparison instrument, the Repeatable Battery for 
      the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), in counterbalance order 
      immediately before any ECT and after the sixth ECT treatment episode. Apathy 
      (Apathy Scale) and depression (Profile of Mood states Short Form) were measured 
      on both occasions. Analyses compared performances on the 2 cognitive instruments 
      and examined for associations with the measures of apathy or depression. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-eight individuals (9 male, 19 female) aged 19 to 84 years underwent 
      testing. Performances on the total ARCS were similar to those on the total RBANS, 
      and both showed decline from baseline to follow-up. The total ARCS and RBANS 
      measures correlated well (r = 0.75, P < 0.001). Neither apathy nor depression 
      scores were significantly associated with scores on either the RBANS or ARCS. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The ARCS was acceptable and convenient in the assessment of 
      cognition in patients undergoing treatment with ECT. In light of its practical 
      advantages, further evaluation of the ARCS for detecting cognitive impairment and 
      tracking cognitive changes during ECT seems warranted.

TI  - Assessment of behavioral determinants influencing success of supervised exercise 
      therapy in patients with intermittent claudication: A cross sectional survey.
PG  - 112732
LID - S0031-9384(19)30163-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.112732 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Supervised exercise therapy is the first step in treatment of 
      intermittent claudication. However, adherence to supervised exercise therapy is 
      low. Limited access and reimbursement issues are known reasons, though lack of 
      motivation is often leading. Behavioral determinants influencing motivation and 
      thus adherence to supervised exercise therapy remain to be investigated. In this 
      study we sought to determine which behavioral determinants would be of influence 
      on the long-term adherence of supervised exercise therapy. METHODS: 200 patients, 
      newly diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease Rutherford classification 
      II-III, were sent a questionnaire to assess motivation and behavior with regard 
      to supervised exercise therapy. The questionnaire was constructed using the 
      I-CHANGE model for explaining motivational and behavioral change. Baseline 
      characteristics were acquired from medical records. Alpha Cronbach's was 
      calculated to test reliability of the questionnaire. RESULTS: 108 (54%) patients 
      returned their questionnaire. A total of 79% patients followed supervised 
      exercise therapy. Patients who increased their walking distance after supervised 
      exercise therapy have significantly greater knowledge (p = 0.05), positive 
      attitude (p = 0.03) and lower negative attitude (p = 0.01). Patients with a 
      higher self-efficacy remained significantly more active after participating in 
      supervised exercise therapy (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Increasing the determinants 
      knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy will improve adherence to supervised 
      exercise therapy and result in delayed claudication onset time.

TI  - Performance and Symptom Validity Assessment in Patients with Apathy and Cognitive 
      Impairment.
PG  - 314-321
LID - 10.1017/S1355617719001139 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Performance and symptom validity tests (PVTs and SVTs) measure the 
      credibility of the assessment results. Cognitive impairment and apathy 
      potentially interfere with validity test performance and may thus lead to an 
      incorrect (i.e., false-positive) classification of the patient's scores as 
      non-credible. The study aimed at examining the false-positive rate of three 
      validity tests in patients with cognitive impairment and apathy. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional, comparative study was performed in 56 patients with dementia, 41 
      patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 41 patients with Parkinson's 
      disease. Two PVTs - the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) and the Dot Counting 
      Test (DCT) - and one SVT - the Structured Inventory of Malingered Symptomatology 
      (SIMS) - were administered. Apathy was measured with the Apathy Evaluation Scale, 
      and severity of cognitive impairment with the Mini Mental State Examination. 
      RESULTS: The failure rate was 13.7% for the TOMM, 23.8% for the DCT, and 12.5% 
      for the SIMS. Of the patients with data on all three tests (n = 105), 13.5% 
      failed one test, 2.9% failed two tests, and none failed all three. Failing the 
      PVTs was associated with cognitive impairment, but not with apathy. Failing the 
      SVT was related to apathy, but not to cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      patients with cognitive impairment or apathy, failing one validity test is not 
      uncommon. Validity tests are differentially sensitive to cognitive impairment and 
      apathy. However, the rule that at least two validity tests should be failed to 
      identify non-credibility seemed to ensure a high percentage of correct 
      classification of credibility.

AB  - Purpose/Objectives: To describe advanced cancer patient-spouse caregiver couples' 
      cancer-related concerns, determine dyadic concordance of concerns, and predict 
      concordance based on demographic characteristics.Design/Research Approach: 
      Secondary analysis of cross-sectional self-report data.Sample/Participants: 88 
      advanced cancer patients and spouse self-identified 
      caregivers.Methods/Methodological Approach: Participants individually completed 
      questionnaires, including demographics and the Cancer Inventory of Problem 
      Situations. Data are described and concordances were calculated using Kappa 
      scores. Generalized Linear Modeling was used to predict concordances using 
      demographic characteristics.Findings: The top patient concern was lack of energy, 
      while the top spouse caregiver concern was worry about cancer. Couples generally 
      had low concordance about concerns. Demographic characteristics did not 
      significantly predict concordance.Conclusions/Interpretation: Low inter- and 
      intra-dyadic congruence may suggest little communication within couples regarding 
      cancer-related concerns.Implications for Psychosocial Providers or Policy: 
      Healthcare providers should reinforce the importance of communication among 
      patients and spouse caregivers to improve concordance and potentially reduce 
      conflict.

TI  - Early Improvements of Individual Symptoms With Antipsychotics Predict Subsequent 
      Treatment Response of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease: A 
      Re-Analysis of the CATIE-AD Study.
LID - 19m12961 [pii]
LID - 10.4088/JCP.19m12961 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to identify individual symptoms whose 
      early improvements contributed to subsequent treatment response to antipsychotics 
      for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      using the dataset of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention 
      Effectiveness-Alzheimer's Disease (CATIE-AD). METHODS: The CATIE-AD study was 
      conducted between April 2001 and November 2004 at 45 sites in the United States. 
      Data for 421 patients with DSM-IV AD with NPSs treated with antipsychotics were 
      analyzed in the present study. Treatment response was defined as a reduction of ≥ 
      9 points in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score or a reduction of ≥ 25% 
      from baseline in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total score at week 8. 
      Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine associations between 
      response and clinical and demographic characteristics, including each total or 
      individual symptom score reduction at week 2. RESULTS: Reduction in NPI or BPRS 
      total score at week 2 and several individual symptom score reductions 
      (euphoria/elation, irritability, hallucinations, anxiety, agitation, apathy, 
      disinhibition, and depression among NPI subitems; excitement, suspiciousness, 
      disorientation, hostility, depressive mood, and emotional withdrawal among BPRS 
      subitems) at week 2 were significantly associated with subsequent treatment 
      response at week 8 (all P values < .05); Early non-improvements of irritability 
      and suspiciousness were shown to be especially influential clinical markers in 
      predicting subsequent treatment nonresponse. Furthermore, healthier condition at 
      baseline was significantly associated with treatment response at week 8 (P < 
      .05). CONCLUSIONS: Although further research to validate these preliminary 
      findings is needed, focusing on early improvements of individual symptoms could 
      help identify subsequent treatment responders to antipsychotics in AD patients 
      with NPSs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00015548.

TI  - The Value of Neuropsychological Assessment in the Differentiation Between 
      Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia and Late-Onset Psychiatric Disorders.
LID - 19m12811 [pii]
LID - 10.4088/JCP.19m12811 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate which neuropsychological tests can discriminate between 
      behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and psychiatric disorders 
      presenting with similar late-onset frontal behavioral changes, such as apathy, 
      disinhibition, reduced empathy, or compulsive behavior. METHODS: Patients 
      presenting with frontal behavioral changes in middle or late adulthood received 
      extensive baseline examinations, including neuropsychological assessment and 
      brain imaging. After 2 years, examinations were repeated and patients were 
      diagnosed according to DSM-IV or international bvFTD consensus criteria. The 
      study period was April 2011-June 2015. Two groups were selected: 32 patients with 
      bvFTD and 53 patients with a psychiatric or psychological diagnosis. Associations 
      between neuropsychological test scores and diagnostic group were investigated 
      with logistic regression analyses, and diagnostic accuracy was investigated with 
      a receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: BvFTD patients scored lower 
      on tests for confrontational naming, gestalt completion, and verbal abstraction 
      compared to psychiatric patients (P < .01). The confrontational naming test 
      (Boston Naming Test) showed the strongest association with diagnostic group: a 
      lower score indicated a higher probability for a bvFTD diagnosis (P < .001). This 
      test could discriminate between the groups with good diagnostic accuracy (area 
      under the curve = 0.81). Tests for attention, memory, and executive functions 
      showed no discriminative ability between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although one of 
      the criteria of bvFTD is low performance on executive tests, these tests are not 
      useful in differentiating bvFTD from psychiatric disorders. We recommend 
      administering language tests, especially an extensive confrontational naming 
      test, to aid differentiation between bvFTD and a psychiatric disorder in patients 
      presenting with late-onset frontal behavioral changes.

      Greek population.
PG  - 78-85
LID - 10.1080/21678421.2019.1655059 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: (1) Adapt the ECAS into Greek, validate it in ALS patients and 
      compare with the ALS-CBS. (2) Determine the sensitivity and specificity of ECAS 
      in the differentiation between AD and non-demented ALS patients as compared with 
      the ACE-III and mini-ACE. Methods: ALS patients (n = 28) were recruited and AD 
      patients (n = 26) were matched in age, sex, and education with ALS patients 
      (n = 24). The normative data were derived from a random sample of controls 
      (n = 52). Bayes correlation analysis was conducted to examine convergent 
      validity. Bayes t-test was performed to assess between groups' differences. 
      Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses and area under the curve 
      (AUC) were implemented to appraise the sensitivity and specificity in the 
      differentiation between the AD and non-demented ALS patients. Results: The ECAS 
      and its sub-scores in addition to the behavior interview demonstrated robust 
      correlations with the ALS-CBS. Impairment in language and verbal fluency were the 
      most prominent deficits in the ALS patients. The most frequently reported change 
      was apathy. The ROC analysis demonstrated that the ECAS-ALS nonspecific score 
      (comprising memory and visuospatial domains) is the most sensitive and specific 
      in differentiating the AD from ALS patients. The other measures expressed high 
      sensitivity, yet a poor specificity. Conclusions: The ECAS is a multi-purpose 
      screening tool. The ECAS-ALS specific appraises the whole spectrum of the highly 
      prevalent cognitive impairments in ALS. The ECAS-ALS nonspecific (memory and 
      visuospatial) is a sensitive score to detect AD related deficits and is able to 
      differentiate the AD from the non-demented ALS patients better than the ACE-III 
      and mini-ACE.

AB  - Objective: Apathy is a prominent syndrome across neurodegenerative diseases. The 
      Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) assesses three apathy subtypes-executive, 
      emotional, and initiation-and is sensitive and valid in amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease. This study 
      describes the development of the brief DAS (b-DAS), which will enable apathy to 
      be swiftly detected in the clinic.Method: 102 ALS and 102 AD patients' previously 
      collected data were used. Mokken analyses were performed on item-level data of 
      each informant/carer-rated DAS subscale (executive, emotional, and initiation) 
      for the initial scale reduction. Item-total correlational analyses against 
      standard apathy (convergent validity criteria) and depression (divergent validity 
      criteria) measures and qualitative examination of items aided final item 
      selection. Receiver operating curve analysis determined optimal cutoffs for the 
      reduced subscales.Results: Mokken analyses suggested unidimensionality of each 
      DAS subscale. Three items were removed that failed to satisfy monotone 
      homogeneity model requirements, three items were removed due to validity criteria 
      not being met, and six items were removed due to a combination of lower item 
      scalability and item-total correlations. Item-theme examination further reduced 
      the b-DAS to nine items, three per subscale, with a supplemental awareness 
      deficit assessment being added. Sensitivity- and specificity-based optimal 
      cutoffs were calculated for each b-DAS subscale.Conclusions: This study presents 
      the b-DAS, an informant/carer-based robust yet short multidimensional apathy 
      instrument with good convergent and divergent validity, with recommended clinical 
      cutoffs. The b-DAS is appropriate for use in the clinic and for research to 
      quickly and comprehensively screen for apathy subtype impairments.

TI  - Can Social Cognition Measurements Differentiate Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal 
      Dementia from Alzheimer's Disease Regardless of Apathy?
PG  - 817-827
LID - 10.3233/JAD-190861 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioral variant frontotemporal 
      dementia (bvFTD) share cognitive and behavioral symptoms, such as apathy. Social 
      cognition measurements are useful in distinguishing bvFTD from AD, but their 
      accuracies may be affected by apathy. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether social 
      cognition measurements can distinguish bvFTD from either apathetic or 
      non-apathetic AD patients. METHODS: Three groups of participants were enrolled in 
      the present study: bvFTD (n = 22), AD (n = 20), and healthy controls (HC, 
      n = 23). The AD group was divided into apathetic (n = 10) and non-apathetic 
      (n = 10). All subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychological examination, 
      including the short version of the Social and Emotional Assessment (Mini-SEA), 
      which comprises the facial emotion recognition test and the faux-pas recognition 
      test (Faux-Pas Test). Apathy was assessed according to the Starkstein's Apathy 
      (SA) Scale. RESULTS: The bvFTD and AD groups did not differ on global cognitive 
      efficiency and on executive functions. In comparison to the whole AD group, bvFTD 
      displayed lower Faux-Pas Test and Mini-SEA scores. Both AD subgroups, apathetic 
      or non-apathetic, exhibited similar performance on all social cognition 
      measurements. In comparison to either apathetic AD or non-apathetic AD, bvFTD 
      patients underperformed on the Faux-Pas Test and on the Mini-SEA. The area under 
      the curve values for the Mini-SEA total score were 0.87 (bvFTD versus AD), 0.90 
      (bvFTD versus apathetic AD), and 0.83 (bvFTD versus non-apathetic AD). 
      CONCLUSION: Social cognition tests provide accurate distinction between bvFTD 
      against either apathetic AD or non-apathetic AD. Social cognition measurements 
      did not correlate with apathy severity.

TI  - The "Interest Game": A Ludic Application to Improve Apathy Assessment in Patients 
      with Neurocognitive Disorders.
PG  - 669-677
LID - 10.3233/JAD-191282 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy, a highly prevalent behavioral disorder in Alzheimer's disease 
      and other related disorders, is currently assessed using clinical scales as it is 
      for all neuropsychiatric disorders. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to 
      propose a new type of assessment using new technologies designed to assess loss 
      of interest by a more implicit and indirect method. METHODS: The Interest Game is 
      a form of interactive self-report, where categories of interests are presented in 
      order to quantify them and identify the activities that constitute them. Two 
      indices can be extracted, the number of categories and the number of activities 
      selected. We compared the scores between three groups: Apathetic (A) and 
      Non-Apathetic (NA) subjects (according to the Apathy Diagnostic Criteria) and 
      controls with no objective cognitive impairment. RESULTS: 95 subjects were 
      included. Results showed that subjects from the A group had significantly less 
      interests (both categories and images selected) than the NA group. As expected, 
      the control group selected a higher number of categories than the other groups. 
      The diagnosis (minor or major neurocognitive disorder) and level of education had 
      also a significant effect on the number of categories selected. Furthermore, 
      subjects with major neurocognitive disorder (NCD) had significantly less 
      interests than minor NCD group. The number of categories measure was more 
      sensitive than the number of images selected. CONCLUSION: The Interest Game is a 
      promising tool to quantify and identify subject interests and differentiate 
      between apathetic and non-apathetic subjects. Future studies should focus on 
      including more apathetic subjects in the minor NCD group and validating this tool 
      with the general population.

AB  - In this study, we investigated associations between neuropsychiatric symptoms 
      (i.e., apathy, anxiety, and depression) and cerebral atrophy, white matter 
      lesions (WML), beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, and cognitive decline in a 
      nondemented sample. 104 cognitively unimpaired and 53 subjects with mild 
      cognitive impairment were followed for up to 4 years within the Swedish BioFINDER 
      study. Neuropsychiatric assessments included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
      Scale and the Apathy Evaluation Scale. Magnetic resonance imaging and 
      (18)F-flutemetamol-positron emission tomography quantified brain atrophy, WML, 
      and Aβ deposition. Mini-Mental State Examination assessed longitudinal global 
      cognition. Regression analyses were used to test for associations. Apathy and 
      anxiety were shown related to Aβ deposition and predicted cognitive decline. 
      Anxiety also interacted with amyloid status to predict faster cognitive 
      deterioration. Apathy was further related to frontotemporal and subcortical 
      atrophy, as well as WML. To conclude, the associations between apathy and anxiety 
      with Aβ deposition and cognitive decline point to these symptoms as early 
      clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Apathy as a behavioural marker of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease: a 
      longitudinal analysis.
PG  - 214-227
LID - 10.1007/s00415-019-09538-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the longitudinal course of non-motor symptoms, and 
      finding markers to predict cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD), are 
      priorities. Previous work has demonstrated that apathy is one of the only 
      behavioural symptoms that differentiates people with PD and intact cognition from 
      those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI-PD). Other psychiatric symptoms emerge 
      as dementia in PD develops. OBJECTIVE: We explored statistical models of 
      longitudinal change to detect apathy as a behavioural predictor of cognitive 
      decline in PD. METHODS: We followed 104 people with PD intermittently over 2 
      years, undertaking a variety of motor, behavioural and cognitive measures. We 
      applied a linear mixed effects model to explore behavioural factors associated 
      with cognitive change over time. Our approach goes beyond conventional modelling 
      based on a random-intercept and slope approach, and can be used to examine the 
      variability in measures within individuals over time. RESULTS: Global cognitive 
      scores worsened during the two-year follow-up, whereas the longitudinal evolution 
      of self-rated apathy scores and other behavioural measures was negligible. Level 
      of apathy was negatively (- 0.598) correlated with level of cognitive impairment 
      and participants with higher than average apathy scores at baseline also had 
      poorer cognition. The model indicated that departure from the mean apathy score 
      at any point in time was mirrored by a corresponding departure from average 
      global cognitive score. CONCLUSION: High levels of apathy are predictive of 
      negative cognitive and behavioural outcomes over time, suggesting that apathy may 
      be a behavioural indicator of early cognitive decline. This has clinical and 
      prognostic implications.

TI  - Are we accurately evaluating depression in patients with cancer?
PG  - 98-107
LID - 10.1037/pas0000765 [doi]
AB  - Depression remains poorly managed in oncology, in part because of the difficulty 
      of reliably screening and assessing for depression in the context of medical 
      illness. Whether somatic items really skew the ability to identify "true" 
      depression, or represent meaningful indicators of depression, remains to be 
      determined. This study utilized item response theory (IRT) to compare the 
      performance of traditional depression criteria with Endicott's substitutive 
      criteria (ESC; tearfulness or depressed appearance; social withdrawal; brooding; 
      cannot be cheered up). The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), ESC, and Center 
      for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) were administered to 558 
      outpatients with cancer. IRT models were utilized to evaluate global and item fit 
      for traditional PHQ-9 items compared with a modified version replacing the 4 
      somatic items with ESC. The modified PHQ-9 ESC scale was the best fit using a 
      partial credit model; model fit was improved after collapsing the middle 2 
      response categories and removing psychomotor agitation/retardation. This improved 
      model showed satisfactory scale precision and internal consistency, and was free 
      from differential item functioning for gender, age, and race. Concurrent and 
      criterion validity were supported. Thus, as many have speculated, utilizing the 
      ESC may result in more accurate identification of depressive symptoms in 
      oncology. Depressed mood, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation retained their 
      expected properties in the modified scale, indicating that the traditional 
      underlying syndrome of depression likely remains the same, but the ESC may 
      provide more specificity when assessing patients with cancer. (PsycINFO Database

TI  - Validation of the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory Observational (CMAI-O) 
      tool.
PG  - 75-85
LID - 10.1017/S1041610219000279 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Behaviours associated with agitation are common in people living with 
      dementia. The Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) is a 29-item scale 
      widely used to assess agitation completed by a proxy (family carer or staff 
      member). However, proxy informants introduce possible reporting bias when 
      blinding to the treatment arm is not possible, and potential accuracy issues due 
      to irregular contact between the proxy and the person with dementia over the 
      reporting period. An observational measure completed by a blinded researcher may 
      address these issues, but no agitation measures with comparable items exist. 
      DESIGN: Development and validation of an observational version of the CMAI 
      (CMAI-O), to assess its validity as an alternative or complementary measure of 
      agitation. SETTING: Fifty care homes in England. PARTICIPANTS: Residents (N = 
      726) with dementia. MEASUREMENTS: Two observational measures (CMAI-O and PAS) 
      were completed by an independent researcher. Measures of agitation, functional 
      status, and neuropsychiatric symptoms were completed with staff proxies. RESULTS: 
      The CMAI-O showed adequate internal consistency (α = .61), criterion validity 
      with the PAS (r = .79, p = < .001), incremental validity in predicting quality of 
      life beyond the Functional Assessment Staging of Alzheimer's disease (β = 1.83, p 
      < .001 at baseline) and discriminant validity from the Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
      Apathy subscale (r = .004, p = .902). CONCLUSIONS: The CMAI-O is a promising 
      research tool for independently measuring agitation in people with dementia in 
      care homes. Its use alongside the CMAI could provide a more robust understanding 
      of agitation amongst residents with dementia.

TI  - A network approach on the relation between apathy and depression symptoms with 
      dementia and functional disability.
PG  - 1655-1663
LID - 10.1017/S1041610218002387 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on the association between depression and dementia risk 
      mostly use sum scores on depression questionnaires to model symptomatology 
      severity. Since individual items may contribute differently to this association, 
      this approach has limited validity. METHODS: We used network analysis to 
      investigate the functioning of individual Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) 
      items, of which, based on studies that used factor analysis, 3 are generally 
      considered to measure apathy (GDS-3A) and 12 depression (GDS-12D). Functional 
      disability and future dementia were also included in our analysis. Data were 
      extracted from 3229 participants of the Prevention of Dementia by Intensive 
      Vascular care trial (preDIVA), analyzed as a single cohort, yielding 20,542 
      person-years of observation. We estimated a sparse network by only including 
      connections between variables that could not be accounted for by variance in 
      other variables. For this, we used a repeated L1 regularized regression 
      procedure. RESULTS: This procedure resulted in a selection of 59/136 possible 
      connections. GDS-3A items were strongly connected to each other and with varying 
      strength to several GDS-12D items. Functional disability was connected to all 
      three GDS-3A items and the GDS-12D items "helplessness" and "worthlessness". 
      Future dementia was only connected to the GDS-12D item "memory problems", which 
      was in turn connected to the GDS-12D items "unhappiness" and "helplessness" and 
      all three GDS-3A items. CONCLUSION: Network analysis reveals interesting 
      relationships between GDS items, functional disability and dementia risk. We 
      discuss what implications our results may have for (future) research on the 
      associations between depression and/or apathy with dementia.

      Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 1496-1504
LID - 10.1002/mds.27820 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fear of falling may be significantly associated with falls in 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) and may have a negative impact on quality of life. 
      Nevertheless, there are no valid and reliable tools to examine this condition in 
      PD. The objective of this study was to design and determine the psychometric 
      attributes of an instrument to assess fear of falling in PD. METHODS: A 
      prospective 1-year, 2-phase study was conducted to validate the Fear of Falling 
      Scale, a self-assessed instrument for assessing fear of falling in PD. During 
      phase 1, we designed a scale to measure the severity of fear of falling and 
      determine its baseline psychometric characteristics, whereas phase 2 was a 1-year 
      follow-up study to assess the frequency of falls and other clinical factors 
      linked to fear of falling. Convergent and discriminant validity were assessed 
      against the Fear of Falling Measure and the Starkstein Apathy Scale, 
      respectively. RESULTS: The Fear of Falling Scale showed high internal 
      consistency, test-retest reliability, and strong convergent and discriminant 
      validity. There was a significant association between fear of falling score and 
      the presence of both generalized anxiety disorder and major depression, poor 
      balance-related motor ability, increased nonmotor symptoms of PD, more severe 
      impairments in activities of daily living, and increased motor fluctuations. 
      Finally, generalized anxiety disorder was a significant predictor of number of 
      falls during a 12-month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: The Fear of Falling Scale 
      is a valid and reliable instrument to assess fear of falling in PD. Fear of 
      falling in PD is associated with specific psychiatric and motor disorders and is 
      significantly related to the performance of balance-related motor functions. ©

TI  - Fatigue in patients with vestibular schwannoma.
PG  - 1809-1816
LID - 10.1007/s00701-019-04003-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS) often complain about 
      tiredness, exhaustion, lack of energy, and strength, but such symptoms of fatigue 
      have scarcely been objectified and analyzed in a VS population. We aimed to 
      characterize fatigue in a cohort of patients with VS and compare such symptoms 
      with a control group. METHODS: All patients who attended an educational course 
      for patients with VS were surveyed with validated tools for assessment of fatigue 
      (fatigue severity scale), anxiety and depression (hospital anxiety and depression 
      scale), sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness scale), and apathy (Starkstein apathy 
      scale). Quality of Life was assessed with the disease-specific Penn Acoustic 
      Neuroma Quality of Life (PANQOL). Symptom severity was estimated with a visual 
      analog scale (VAS). The results have been compared to a control group consisting 
      of patient companions. RESULTS: Data from 88 VS patients and 49 controls were 
      analyzed. The controls had similar age and sex distribution as patients. 
      Fifty-seven percent of VS patients had significant fatigue, compared to 25% in 
      the control group. The mean fatigue score was 4.1 for the patients, and 2.8 for 
      controls. Patients with fatigue were more likely to have depression, anxiety, 
      sleepiness, and apathy. No correlation of fatigue was found with age, gender, or 
      treatment modality. Regression analyses revealed depression, apathy, and vertigo 
      to be predictors of fatigue. Fatigue was strongly correlated to QoL. CONCLUSION: 
      Almost six out of ten VS patients had fatigue, significantly higher than the

TI  - Impulse control disorders in Parkinson disease and RBD: A longitudinal study of 
      severity.
PG  - e675-e687
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000007942 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence, natural history, and risk factors for 
      impulse control behaviors (ICBs) among people with Parkinson disease (PD), those 
      with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and controls. METHODS: Participants with 
      early PD (within 3.5 years of diagnosis), those with RBD, and controls were 
      clinically phenotyped and screened for ICBs longitudinally (with the 
      Questionnaire for Impulsivity in Parkinson's Disease). ICB-positive individuals 
      were invited for a semistructured interview, repeated 1 year later. The severity 
      of the ICB was assessed with the Parkinson's Impulse Control Scale. Multiple 
      imputation and regression models were used to estimate ICB prevalence and 
      associations. RESULTS: Data from 921 cases of PD at baseline, 768 cases at 18 
      months, and 531 cases at 36 months were included, with 21% to 25% screening 
      positive for ICBs at each visit. Interviews of ICB screen-positive individuals 
      revealed that 10% met formal criteria for impulse control disorders (ICD), while 
      33% had subsyndromal ICD (ICB symptoms without reaching the formal diagnostic 
      criteria for ICD). When these data were combined through the use of multiple 
      imputation, the prevalence of PD-ICB was estimated at 19.1% (95% confidence 
      interval 10.1-28.2). On follow-up, 24% of cases of subsyndromal ICD had developed 
      full symptoms of an ICD. PD-ICD was associated with dopamine agonist use, motor 
      complications, and apathy but not PD-RBD. ICD prevalence in the RBD group (1%) 
      was similar to that in controls (0.7%). CONCLUSIONS: ICBs occur in 19.1% of 
      patients with early PD, many persisting or worsening over time. RBD is not 
      associated with increased ICD risk. Psychosocial drivers, including mood and 
      support networks, affect severity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life in Parkinson's disease may be affected 
      by a wide range of motor and non-motor symptoms. Identifying which symptoms are 
      significant predictors of health-related quality of life in Parkinson's disease 
      prioritizes symptoms for treatment, therapeutic development, and clinical 
      outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To determine predictors of health-related quality of life 
      in patients with Parkinson's disease. METHODS: We recruited 102 subjects into a 
      prospective study to investigate neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's 
      disease. Health-related quality of life was measured with the 39-item Parkinson's 
      Disease Questionnaire. Subjects completed the Movement Disorder Society Unified 
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Parts I-IV as well as validated scales to assess 
      anxiety, depression, apathy, cognition, psychosis, impulsive-compulsive disorder, 
      autonomic dysfunction, sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, and rapid eye 
      movement sleep behavior disorder. We used univariate analyses to select clinical 
      predictors to construct a multivariate regression model to determine which 
      predictors were independently associated with worse health-related quality of 
      life. RESULTS: In a multivariate linear regression model adjusted for age and 
      gender, higher scores for the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder 
      Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part II as well more severe 
      symptoms of depression, anxiety, apathy, and excessive daytime sleepiness were 
      associated with worse health-related quality of life. The model explained 78% of 
      the variance of health-related quality of life, and the non-motor symptoms 
      explained 49% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety, depression, excessive 
      daytime sleepiness, apathy, and impairment in activities of daily living related 
      to motor symptoms were independently associated with worse health-related quality 
      of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to explore symptoms and the effectiveness 
      of their management in older adult palliative care candidates in Lebanon. The 
      aims of this study were to: (1) determine symptom prevalence in Lebanese older 
      adults who qualify for palliative care; (2) identify the severity and distress of 
      symptoms; (3) identify the prevalence of symptom management and its efficacy; and 
      (4) explore the relationship between overall symptom burden and its correlates. 
      METHOD: This study uses an observational cross-sectional design using convenience 
      sampling (N = 203) to recruit older adults qualifying for palliative care from 
      three major medical centers in Lebanon. RESULT: The mean age of the sample was 
      78.61 years. The most prevalent symptoms were lack of energy (93.5%), worrying 
      (83.2%), and pain (71.4%). Psychological symptoms had the highest mean scores, 
      preceded only by the physical symptoms and lack of energy. The most treated 
      symptoms were physical with pain having the highest treatment prevalence (91%). 
      Although psychological symptoms were the most burdensome, they were poorly 
      treated. Multiple regression analysis showed that symptom scores had significant 
      positive associations with financial status, social functioning, and 
      comorbidities; there was a negative association with age. SIGNIFICANCE OF 
      RESULTS: Lack of energy and psychological symptoms were the most prevalent, with 
      the latter having the highest mean total symptom scores. Treatment was poor for 
      psychological symptoms and effective for physical ones. Associations were found 
      between age, comorbidity, financial problems, social functioning, and total 
      physical and psychological mean symptom burden scores. More attention needs to be 
      given to psychological symptoms and their management among older adults receiving 
      palliative care.

      long-term care settings for residents with moderate to advanced dementia. The 
      Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is a widely used instrument and its use for 
      long-term care residents with dementia needs to be further established. This 
      study explored the relationship among apathy assessments conducted by family and 
      clinical caregivers using the original AES (AES-18) and the nursing home version 
      (AES-10). METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive design and 
      enrolled 15 quartets of participants recruited from long-term care settings. Each 
      quartet consisted of one resident with dementia, one family member, one certified 
      nursing assistant (CNA), and one licensed practical nurse (LPN) or activity 
      staff. Family, CNAs, and LPNs/activity staff rated the resident’s apathy level on 
      the AES independently. Bivariate Pearson correlation coefficients were used for 
      analysis. RESULTS: The results revealed that ratings conducted by CNAs and 
      LPNs/activity staff were moderately correlated for the AES-18 and the result 
      approached statistical significance (r=0.47, p= .08). None of the other AES 
      ratings among family, CNAs, and LPNs/activity staff were significantly 
      correlated. DISCUSSION: Family and clinical caregivers were incongruent on their 
      AES ratings of apathy. It remains undetermined which rater provides the most 
      valid AES rating for residents with dementia. Findings from this study further 
      highlight challenges in rating apathy in this population. Future research is 
      needed to determine best practices for accurate apathy assessment for residents 
      with dementia in long-term care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While numerous validated questionnaires measuring psychiatric 
      symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are available, a quick multifaceted 
      screening tool is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To generate the Brief Psychiatric 
      Questionnaire (BPQ) that quickly screens for depression, anxiety, and apathy and 
      to evaluate its content validity against three reference scales. METHODS: 
      Forty-seven questions were drafted and measured against the Geriatric Depression 
      Scale (GDS), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (Form Y2) (STAI-Y2), and Apathy 
      Evaluation Scale (AES). Data were reduced by principal component analysis and 
      linear regression. Content validity and repeatability were assessed in a second 
      cohort. RESULTS: Data from ninety-five patients were used for BPQ development. 
      Variation explained by the final linear regression models was 52% for GDS (R 
      (2) = 0.521, F(2,94) = 49.97, p < 0.0001), 65% for STAI-Y2 (R (2) = 0.652, 
      F(4,94) = 42.08, p < 0.0001), and 14% for AES (R (2) = 0.135, F(1,94) = 14.51, p 
      < 0.0001). From the initial pool, only five questions remained for further 
      testing. BPQ questions correctly identified 88% in the second cohort of 33 
      patients scoring more than five on GDS and 91% who scored in the highest decile 
      of STAI-Y2, but only 51% who scored in the highest decile of AES. Moderate to 
      strong correlation (r = 0.464 - 0.733, p < 0.004) between predicted scores based 
      on BPQ questions and actual scores of three validated questionnaires was 
      demonstrated. Good repeatability of BPQ questions was demonstrated by moderate to 
      high intraclass correlation coefficients (0.47-0.772, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: BPQ 
      questions were able to accurately identify patients at risk of depression and 
      anxiety but not apathy. It is brief and multifaceted and can act as a 
      preconsultation tool to prompt further psychiatric assessment.

TI  - Assessing anxiety and its correlates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: The 
      state-trait anxiety inventory.
PG  - 47-55
LID - 10.1002/mus.26475 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We evaluated: (1) psychometric properties of State-Trait Anxiety 
      Inventory Form Y (STAI Form Y); (2) clinical correlates of state and trait 
      anxiety; (3) associations of anxiety with quality of life (QoL) dimensions. 
      METHODS: We assessed 159 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) on 
      STAI Form Y and on tests and questionnaires for depression, apathy, QoL, and 
      cognitive abilities. RESULTS: Clinically diagnosed anxiety (by Mini International 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory) occurred in 30 (19%) patients. STAI Form Y fitted a 
      2-factor structure and showed good psychometric properties. State and trait 
      anxiety were weakly associated with female sex, bulbar functional decay, and 
      cognitive decline in language and memory; trait anxiety was associated with lower 
      educational attainment and poorer scores on visuospatial tasks. State and trait 
      anxiety were associated with poorer physical and psychosocial QoL dimensions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety is tightly associated with QoL in ALS, and can be reliably 
      assessed by STAI Form Y. Muscle Nerve, 2019.

TI  - Can we predict amyloid deposition by objective cognition and regional cerebral 
      blood flow in patients with subjective cognitive decline?
PG  - 325-332
LID - 10.1111/psyg.12397 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may herald the first symptoms of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) whereas individuals with beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition 
      are regarded as a high-risk group for AD. Recently, amyloid positron emission 
      tomography (PET) studies have demonstrated clinical and cognitive feature 
      differences between Aβ-positive and negative SCD, but details of their 
      differences remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the relationships among Aβ 
      deposition, clinical, and cognitive features in patients with SCD. METHODS: 
      Forty-two patients with SCD (22 women, 74.5 ± 4.7 years) were examined using 
      fluorine-18 florbetaben PET and were divided into Aβ-positive (n = 10) and 
      negative (n = 32) groups. We compared cognitive and psychological outcomes, and 
      single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging data between the two 
      groups. In addition, a linear regression analysis was performed to assess 
      relationships between the severity of SCD and neuropsychological tests, affective 
      scores, and demographic factors. RESULTS: The rate of score changes from the 
      immediate recall to delayed recall in the logical memory subtest of the 
      Wechsler's Memory Scale Revised were different between the groups (P = 0.04). 
      However, the binary logistic regression analysis showed no significant 
      differences between the two. In addition, the severity of SCD was significantly 
      strong in women (P = 0.002). Furthermore, within the Aβ-negative group, 
      subjective memory loss correlated with word fluency category score (P = 0.023) 
      and apathy scale (P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were 
      observed between Aβ-positive and -negative SCD on any of the neuropsychological 
      measures, clinical measures, or SPECT imaging. Further, the severity of SCD was 
      not predicted by the symptoms of anxiety, depression, or neuropsychological 
      examination.

      Outpatients with Heart Failure.
PG  - 1689-1694
LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.2034-18 [doi]
AB  - Objective Depression is common in patients with heart failure (HF) and is a 
      possible risk factor for adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine 
      the prevalence of depression assessed by the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire 
      (PHQ-2) and the effect of depression on outcomes in Japanese outpatients with HF. 
      Methods This sub-analysis of a prospective observational study assessed 976 
      patients with HF (mean age 66±13 years; 26.7% female; 42.7% with an ischemic 
      etiology). Depression was defined as a PHQ-2 score ≥3. The main composite outcome 
      was death from any cause or hospitalization due to worsening HF. PHQ-2 items were 
      extracted from the PHQ-9 results. To evaluate the association of PHQ-2 scores 
      with outcomes, Cox proportional hazards models were evaluated. Results 
      Fifty-seven (5.8%) patients were diagnosed with depression. During a median 
      follow-up of 21 months, the incidence rates for death from any cause and 
      hospitalization due to worsening HF in patients with and without depression were 
      2.2 vs. 0.9 per 100 person-years and 6.7 vs. 1.6, p<0.001, respectively. There 
      was a higher incidence of the main outcome in patients with depression than in 
      those without depression (p<0.001). After adjustment for conventional risk 
      factors, depression (PHQ-2 ≥3) was an independent predictor of the main outcome 
      (hazard ratio 2.41, 95% confidence interval 1.14-4.67, p=0.022), and a score for 
      item 1 of the PHQ-2 (loss of interest or pleasure) ≥2 was also an independent 
      risk factor (hazard ratio 3.57, 95% confidence interval 1.85-6.46, p<0.001). 
      Conclusion Depression as assessed by the PHQ-2 was identified in 5.8% of Japanese 
      outpatients with HF and was associated with outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no composite screening tool that can efficiently 
      and effectively assess prevalent yet under-recognized cognitive and 
      neuropsychiatric comorbidities in patients with cardiovascular disease. We aimed 
      to determine the validity and feasibility of a novel screen assessing cognitive 
      impairment, anxiety, apathy and depression (CAAD screen) in those attending 
      cardiac rehabilitation (CR). METHODS: All patients diagnosed with cardiovascular 
      disease or cardiovascular risk factors entering CR were screened as part of 
      clinical care. A subset of those patients agreed to complete validation 
      assessments (n = 127). Screen results were compared to widely accepted standards 
      for cognition, anxiety, apathy, and depression using a modified receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve analysis. RESULTS: The 
      screen was completed by 97% of participants in 10 min or less with an average 
      completion time of approximately 5 min. Screening scores adjusted for age, sex 
      and years of education had acceptable or excellent validity compared to widely 
      accepted standard diagnoses: CAAD-Cog (AUC = 0.80); CAAD-Anx (AUC = 0.81); 
      CAAD-Apathy (AUC = 0.79) and CAAD-Dep (AUC = 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: The CAAD screen 
      may be a valid and feasible tool for detecting cognitive impairment, anxiety, 
      apathy and depression in CR settings.

TI  - Assessing cognition and daily function in early dementia using the 
      cognitive-functional composite: findings from the Catch-Cog study cohort.
PG  - 45
LID - 10.1186/s13195-019-0500-5 [doi]
LID - 45
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cognitive-functional composite (CFC) was designed to improve the 
      measurement of clinically relevant changes in predementia and early dementia 
      stages. We have previously demonstrated its good test-retest reliability and 
      feasibility of use. The current study aimed to evaluate several quality aspects 
      of the CFC, including construct validity, clinical relevance, and suitability for 
      the target population. METHODS: Baseline data of the Capturing Changes in 
      Cognition study was used: an international, prospective cohort study including 
      participants with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment 
      (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). 
      The CFC comprises seven existing cognitive tests focusing on memory and executive 
      functions (EF) and the informant-based Amsterdam Instrumental Activities of Daily 
      Living Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q). Construct validity and clinical relevance were 
      assessed by (1) confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) using all CFC subtests and (2) 
      linear regression analyses relating the CFC score (independent) to reference 
      measures of disease severity (dependent), correcting for age, sex, and education. 
      To assess the suitability for the target population, we compared score 
      distributions of the CFC to those of traditional tests (Alzheimer's Disease 
      Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative 
      Study-Activities of Daily Living scale, and Clinical Dementia Rating scale). 
      RESULTS: A total of 184 participants were included (age 71.8 ± 8.4; 42% female; 
      n = 14 SCD, n = 80 MCI, n = 78 AD, and n = 12 DLB). CFA showed that the 
      hypothesized three-factor model (memory, EF, and IADL) had adequate fit 
      (CFI = .931, RMSEA = .091, SRMR = .06). Moreover, worse CFC performance was 
      associated with more cognitive decline as reported by the informant (β = .61, 
      p < .001), poorer quality of life (β = .51, p < .001), higher caregiver burden 
      (β = - .51, p < .001), more apathy (β = - .36, p < .001), and less cortical 
      volume (β = .34, p = .02). Whilst correlations between the CFC and traditional 
      measures were moderate to strong (ranging from - .65 to .83, all p < .001), 
      histograms showed floor and ceiling effects for the traditional tests as compared 
      to the CFC. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate that the CFC has good construct 
      validity, captures clinically relevant aspects of disease severity, and shows no 
      range restrictions in scoring. It therefore provides a more useful outcome 
      measure than traditional tests to evaluate cognition and function in MCI and mild 
      AD.

TI  - Pilot study to develop and validate a questionnaire based on HIV symptoms index.
PG  - 87-93
LID - 10.7399/fh.11127 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary endpoint is to validate the HIV Symptoms 
      Index Questionnaire in a Spanish  population, in terms of comprehension 
      and acceptability. The secondary endpoints are to describe  symptoms reported by 
      patients, tolerance, and quality of life. METHOD: The pilot trial of an 
      observational and multicenter non-comparative study, for the validation  of the 
      HIV Symptoms Index Questionnaire in a Spanish population. Patients over the age 
      of 18  diagnosed with HIV infection and receiving treatment were included. The 
      symptoms index, treatment  adherence based on pharmacy dispensing records, and 
      quality of life with MOS-HIV questionnaire  were calculated. Statistical 
      analyses were conducted with the SAP System V9.2. RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2014, 
      the HIV Symptoms Index Questionnaire was applied to 75  patients; 95% of these 
      patients considered the questionnaire was easy to apply and understand. The  
      total median score of the questionnaire was nine symptoms (IQR 1-18); and the 
      most frequent symptoms were nerves or anxiety (45%), stomach swelling, pain or 
      gas (40%), sleep  problems (39%), and fatigue or lack of energy (37%). 
      Presence of symptoms was associated with a  worse outcome in the MOS-HIV 
      questionnaire. According to the Visual Analogue Scale, the higher the  score 
      in the questionnaire, the lower the tolerance level (R = -0.51; p &lt; 0.0001), 
      and the higher  number of days with symptoms (R = 0.51; p &lt; 0.0001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The questionnaire was easy to apply. A high tolerance level was 
      confirmed, as well as a  consistent and significant correlation with the MOS-HIV 
      and the Visual Analogue Scale.

TI  - Association Between CSF Beta-Amyloid and Apathy in Early-Stage Alzheimer Disease.
PG  - 164-169
LID - 10.1177/0891988719838627 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The apathetic syndrome is a common clinical feature in patients with 
      Alzheimer diseases (AD), from preclinical phases to late stages of dementia, and 
      it is strongly related to major disease outcomes. Unfortunately, no specific 
      pharmacological treatments for apathy have been accomplished so far. 
      Translational evidences have previously shown that a link between apathy and 
      hallmarks of AD-related pathophysiology, that is, β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and 
      neurofibrillary tangles, exists. However, only few studies investigated the 
      association between core biomarkers of AD and apathy scores, finding conflicting 
      results. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients were identified as having AD dementia 
      according to National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer Association 2011 criteria. All 
      participants underwent an extensive diagnostic workup including cerebrospinal 
      fluid (CSF) assessment to measure the concentrations of Aβ(42), t-tau, and 
      pTau(181.) To follow, they were stratified as: apathy absence, apathy mild, and 
      apathy severe according to the Neuro Psychiatric Inventory-apathy item scores. We 
      investigated for potential associations between apathy scores and CSF biomarkers 
      concentrations as well as for differences in terms of clinical and CSF biomarkers 
      data across the 3 apathy groups. RESULTS: The CSF Aβ(42) concentrations were 
      negatively correlated with apathy scores. In addition, patients with severe 
      apathy had significantly lower Aβ(42) levels compared to nonapathetic ones. 
      CONCLUSION: Based on our results, we encourage further studies to untangle the 
      potential association between the complex pathophysiological dynamics of AD and 
      apathy which may represent an innovative reliable clinical outcome measure to use 
      in clinical trials, investigating treatments with either a symptomatic or a 
      disease-modifying effect.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Behavioral inhibition plays a key role in animal stress research and 
      developmental research in children. Therefore, we examined the robustness of our 
      multifaceted model of adult social inhibition that comprises behavioral 
      inhibition, interpersonal sensitivity, and social withdrawal components. METHOD: 
      A total of 899 adults completed the 15-item Social Inhibition Questionnaire 
      (SIQ15) and measures of emotional distress. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), 
      reliability estimates, and correlational and second-order factor analyses were 
      used to examine the robustness of our model. RESULTS: CFA (RMSEA = 0.052; 
      NFI = 0.938; CFI = 0.957) and Cronbach's α estimates ≥0.87 confirmed the 
      robustness of our multi-facet social inhibition model based on three correlated 
      inhibition, sensitivity, and withdrawal factors in 560 adults from the general 
      population and in 194 undergraduate students. Inhibition, sensitivity, and 
      withdrawal were stable over time (3-month test-retest correlations ≥ 0.78), and 
      were closely related to the Gest Behavioral Inhibition and PID-5 Withdrawal 
      measures in a clinical sample of 145 cardiac patients. Of note, male cardiac 
      patients reported more inhibition and withdrawal than female patients. Across 
      samples, social inhibition was distinctly different from negative affectivity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our 3-facet model of inhibition, sensitivity and withdrawal was 
      robust across samples, and may promote research on adult social inhibition in 
      population-based and clinical studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The role of stroke location as a determinant of mood and 
      cognitive symptoms is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to 
      identify the predictive value of ischemic stroke location, on a voxel basis, for 
      mood and cognitive outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective monocentric 
      study including patients with a supratentorial ischemic stroke was conducted. A 3 
      Tesla brain MRI was performed at baseline. Mood and cognition were assessed using 
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD), apathy inventory (AI), and Montreal 
      Cognitive Assessment scale subscores, performed at 3 months poststroke. 
      Statistical maps of ischemic stroke location associated with 3 months mood and 
      cognitive scores were obtained using a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping 
      approach (Brunner and Munzel test). Significant voxels (false discovery rate 
      [FDR] corrected-P < .01) were identified using the standard Montreal Neurological 
      Institute-152 space template. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-five nonsevere 
      stroke patients were included (64% men, mean age 66 ± 14, median National 
      Institute of Health Stroke Score 3, interquartile range 2-6). Ischemic stroke 
      location was not associated with HAD or AI scores. Language, abstraction, and 
      delayed recall performances were mainly associated with left-side hemispheric 
      lesions. Lesions in both hemispheres were associated with lower performances in 
      visuospatial and executive functions, naming, attention, and orientation. 
      CONCLUSION: Ischemic stroke location does not predict mood outcome at 3 months 
      but is a determinant of cognitive outcome in specific domains.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of apathy, impulsivity, and behavioral 
      change on survival in patients with frontotemporal dementia, progressive 
      supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal syndrome. METHODS: We assessed 124 patients 
      from the epidemiologic PiPPIN (Pick's Disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, 
      Prevalence and Incidence) study. Patients underwent detailed baseline cognitive 
      and behavioral assessment focusing on apathy, impulsivity, and behavioral change. 
      Logistic regression identified predictors of death within 2.5 years from 
      assessment, including age, sex, diagnosis, cognition, and 8 neurobehavioral 
      profiles derived from a principal component analysis of neuropsychological and 
      behavioral measures. RESULTS: An apathetic neurobehavioral profile predicted 
      death (Wald statistic = 8.119, p = 0.004, Exp(B) = 2.912, confidence interval = 
      >1 [1.396-6.075]) and was elevated in all patient groups. This profile 
      represented apathy, weighted strongly to carer reports from the Apathy Evaluation 
      Scale, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and Cambridge Behavioral Inventory. Age at 
      assessment, sex, and global cognitive impairment were not significant predictors. 
      Differences in mortality risk across diagnostic groups were accounted for by 
      their neuropsychiatric and behavioral features. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship 
      between apathy and survival highlights the need to develop more effective and 
      targeted measurement tools to improve its recognition and facilitate treatment. 
      The prognostic importance of apathy suggests that neurobehavioral features might 
      be useful to predict survival and stratify patients for interventional trials. 
      Effective symptomatic interventions targeting the neurobiology of apathy might 
      ultimately also improve prognosis.

AB  - AIM: Low motivation is a core symptom of schizophrenia which significantly 
      impacts successful engagement in and benefit from psychosocial treatments. 
      Therefore, it is important for clinicians to design psychosocial treatments to 
      effectively motivate and engage patients during the treatment. The MUSIC® Model 
      of Academic Motivation Inventory (MMI) is an 18-item instrument with five scales 
      that assess students' motivation during academic tasks. The objective of the 
      current study was to validate the MMI for use with schizophrenia-spectrum 
      patients undergoing cognitive training. METHODS: Participants included 181 people 
      with schizophrenia spectrum disorders enrolled in cognitive training in four 
      countries. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) assessed construct validity. 
      Quality of fit was determined using the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the 
      Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR), and the Root Mean Square Error of 
      Approximation (RMSEA). Pearson's correlation coefficients assessed construct 
      validity and Cronbach's alphas assessed reliability. Furthermore, we examined 
      factor loadings for each inventory item and assessed predictive validity by 
      analyzing MMI scales with attendance outcomes. RESULTS: Consistent with the 
      original MMI validation studies used in academic settings, we found CFI values 
      indicated a good fit, as did the SRMR and RMSEA values. The scales were 
      correlated yet distinct. Cronbach's alpha values ranged from good to excellent 
      and factor loadings showed that all items loaded very well onto their intended 
      factors. The MMI had a positive relationship to treatment intensity. CONCLUSION: 
      The MMI is a valid and reliable tool to use with individuals with schizophrenia 
      spectrum disorders undergoing a cognitive training intervention.

PG  - 380-386
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2018-318619 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioural changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are 
      heterogeneous. The study aim was to identify the behavioural profiles of 
      non-demented patients with ALS and their neuroimaging correlates and to elucidate 
      if they are comparable to those reported in studies of the behavioural-variant of 
      frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). METHODS: Behavioural changes of 102 non-demented 
      patients with ALS were assessed through the Frontal Behavioural Inventory (FBI), 
      a 24-item scale assessing different behavioural modifications, mainly chosen from 
      the core clinical features of FTD. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to 
      detect distinct clusters of behavioural changes based on FBI subscores. The 
      cortical thinning related to each behavioural profile was analysed in 29 patients 
      with ALS. Cronbach's α was used to test the reliability of bvFTD-related FBI 
      clustering in our cohort. RESULTS: Sixty patients with ALS had FBI score≥1. PCA 
      identified three phenotypic clusters loading on disinhibited/hostile, 
      dysexecutive and apathetic FBI subscores. Imaging analyses revealed that the 
      thinning of bilateral orbitofrontal cortex was related to apathy, the right 
      frontotemporal and cingular cortex to the disinhibited/hostile profile and the 
      left precuneus cortex to the dysexecutive behaviours. The bvFTD-associated 
      aggressive profile reliably applied to our cohort. CONCLUSIONS: In non-demented 
      patients with ALS, different behavioural profiles could be identified. The right 
      frontotemporal and cingular cortex thinning was the hallmark of the behavioural 
      profile mostly overlapping that described in bvFTD. Our findings provide the 
      unbiased identification of determinants relevant for a novel stratification of 
      patients with ALS based on their behavioural impairment, which might be useful as 
      proxy of cognitive decline.

TI  - The Suicidal Narrative and Its Relationship to the Suicide Crisis Syndrome and 
      Recent Suicidal Behavior.
PG  - 413-422
LID - 10.1111/sltb.12439 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we introduce the construct of the suicidal narrative, a 
      hypothetical personal narrative linked to imminent suicide, and explore its 
      relationship to near-term suicidal risk and the suicide crisis syndrome (SCS). 
      Psychiatric outpatients (N = 289) were administered the Columbia Suicide-Severity 
      Rating Scale (C-SSRS), Suicide Crisis Inventory (SCI), and Suicide Narrative 
      Inventory (SNI), a novel instrument combining the documented risk factors of 
      Thwarted Belongingness, Perceived Burdensomeness, Humiliation, Social Defeat, 
      Goal Disengagement, and Goal Reengagement. Dimensional measures of past month, 
      lifetime, and past suicidal phenomena, incorporating ideation and behavior, were 
      calculated from the C-SSRS. Structural equation modeling was used to explore the 
      interaction among variables. Factor analysis of the SNI yielded two orthogonal 
      factors, termed Interpersonal and Goal Orientation. The former factor was 
      comprised of Perceived Burdensomeness, Social Defeat, Humiliation, and Thwarted 
      Belongingness, the latter of Goal Disengagement and Goal Reengagement. The 
      Interpersonal factor correlated with both SCS severity and suicidal phenomena in 
      each time frame and the Goal Orientation factor with no other variable. As 
      hypothesized, the proposed model was significant for the past month only. Our 
      findings support the construct of the suicidal narrative and its function as a 
      near-term suicidal risk factor.

TI  - Barriers and Facilitators of Colorectal Cancer Screening in a Federally Qualified 
      Health Center (FQHC).
PG  - 180-190
LID - 10.3122/jabfm.2019.02.180205 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in 
      the United States. Current screening recommendations for individuals aged 50 to 
      75 years include colonoscopy every 10 years, flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 
      years, or annual stool-based testing. Stool-based testing, including fecal 
      immunochemical tests (FITs), are cost effective, easy to perform at home, and 
      noninvasive, yet many patients fail to return testing kits and go unscreened. The 
      purpose of the study was to identify patient characteristics and perceived 
      barriers and facilitators of FIT return. METHODS: Patients in a large, federally 
      qualified health center who received a FIT kit order between January 1 and July 
      1, 2017 were identified. We compared sociodemographic and health characteristics 
      between patients who returned and did not return FITs. We used telephone surveys 
      to nonreturners to identify potential barriers (cost, knowledge, psychosocial 
      factors) and facilitators (prepaid postage, outreach) of FIT kit return. An 
      online survey of clinicians assessed perceived patient barriers and facilitators 
      of colorectal cancer screening. RESULTS: Of the 875 patients who received a FIT 
      order, 435 (49.7%) did not return the kit and 121 of the nonreturners completed a 
      telephone survey. Current smokers had an increased risk of FIT nonreturn compared 
      with never smokers (RR = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.13-1.54). Forgetfulness and lack of 
      motivation were the most common FIT return barriers perceived by both patients 
      and clinicians. Prepaid postage with return address on FIT return envelopes and 
      live call reminders were the most commonly reported facilitators. Barriers and 
      facilitators varied greatest between English- and Spanish-speaking patients. 
      CONCLUSION: In this study, the most common perceived barriers to return of 
      screening fecal test kits were forgetfulness and lack of motivation. The most 
      common perceived facilitators were live call reminders and postage-paid return 
      envelopes. Understanding barriers and facilitators to FITs may be necessary to 
      enhance cancer screening rates in underserved patient populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of 
      men living with advanced prostate cancer. We report population-wide functional 
      outcomes and HRQOL in men with all stages of prostate cancer and identify 
      implications for health-care delivery. METHODS: For this population-based study, 
      men in the UK living 18-42 months after diagnosis of prostate cancer were 
      identified through cancer registration data. A postal survey was administered, 
      which contained validated measures to assess functional outcomes (urinary 
      incontinence, urinary irritation and obstruction, bowel, sexual, and vitality and 
      hormonal function), measured with the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 
      short form (EPIC-26), plus questions about use of interventions for sexual 
      dysfunction) and generic HRQOL (assessed with the 5-level EuroQol five dimensions 
      questionnaire [EQ-5D-5L] measuring mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or 
      discomfort, and anxiety or depression, plus a rating of self-assessed health). 
      Log-linear and binary logistic regression models were used to compare functional 
      outcomes and HRQOL across diagnostic stages and self-reported treatment groups. 
      Each model included adjustment for age, socioeconomic deprivation, and number of 
      other long-term conditions. FINDINGS: 35 823 (60·8%) of 58 930 men responded to 
      the survey. Disease stage was known for 30 733 (85·8%) of 35 823 men; 19 599 
      (63·8%) had stage I or II, 7209 (23·4%) stage III, and 3925 (12·8%) stage IV 
      disease. Mean adjusted EPIC-26 domain scores were high, indicating good function, 
      except for sexual function, for which scores were much lower. Compared with men 
      who did not receive androgen deprivation therapy, more men who received the 
      therapy reported moderate to big problems with hot flushes (30·7% [95% CI 
      29·8-31·6] vs 5·4% [5·0-5·8]), low energy (29·4% [95% CI 28·6-30·3] vs 14·7% 
      [14·2-15·3]), and weight gain (22·5%, 21·7-23·3) vs 6·9% [6·5-7·3]). Poor sexual 
      function was common (81·0%; 95% CI 80·6-81·5), regardless of stage, and more than 
      half of men (n=18 782 [55·8%]) were not offered any intervention to help with 
      this condition. Overall, self-assessed health was similar in men with stage I-III 
      disease, and although slightly reduced in those with stage IV cancer, 23·5% of 
      men with metastatic disease reported no problems on any EQ-5D dimension. 
      INTERPRETATION: Men diagnosed with advanced disease do not report substantially 
      different HRQOL outcomes to those diagnosed with localised disease, although 
      considerable problems with hormonal function and fatigue are reported in men 
      treated with androgen deprivation therapy. Sexual dysfunction is common and most 
      men are not offered helpful intervention or support. Service improvements around 
      sexual rehabilitation and measures to reduce the effects of androgen deprivation 
      therapy are required. FUNDING: The Movember Foundation, in partnership with 
      Prostate Cancer UK.

PG  - 507-514
LID - 10.1007/s00415-018-9166-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To better understand the demographic, neuropsychiatric, cognitive, and 
      motor predictors of apathy in Parkinson's disease (PD). METHOD: 112 participants 
      (M(age) = 68.53 years; M(disease duration) = 6.17 years) were administered the 
      Apathy Scale (AS), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Movement Disorder 
      Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), Trail Making Test 
      (TMT), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV Matrix Reasoning subtest, letter 
      (F-A-S) and category (Animals) fluency, and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised. 
      Psychosis was assessed. A stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed to 
      investigate the ability of demographic factors and clinical assessments to 
      predict nonapathetic (AS ≤ 13) versus apathetic (AS > 13) group membership. 
      RESULTS: The regression analysis yielded a robust model in which older age, less 
      education, elevated BDI-II, current psychosis, higher MDS-UPDRS Part III (motor 
      score), and slower TMT-B performance predicted membership in the apathetic group, 
      with a correct classification rate of 77.5% (Nagelkerke R(2) = 0.48, p < .001). 
      Depression (OR = 9.20, p < .001) and education (OR = 0.66, p = 0.002) contributed 
      significantly to the overall model. A linear regression with AS score as the 
      outcome variable was similar, but TMT-B additionally contributed significantly 
      (p = 0.02) to the overall model, F(6, 86) = 12.02, p < .001, adjusted 
      R(2) = 0.42. CONCLUSIONS: Of the factors examined, depression, education, and 
      executive functioning were the strongest correlates of apathy in PD. These 
      results support the idea that common underlying frontosubcortical disruptions in 
      this population contribute to apathy, depression, and executive dysfunction.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to validate the Apathy 
      Evaluation Scale, self-rated version (AES-S), and assess the severity of apathy 
      in a cognitively healthy middle-aged cohort at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      METHOD: Three hundred and sixteen middle-aged adults were selected to represent a 
      subset of the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Clinical Core: the 
      Investigating Memory in People At-risk, Causes and Treatments cohort. RESULTS: An 
      exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with varimax rotation identified 3 subscales: 
      apathy, disinterest, and social withdrawal factors. Confirmatory factor analysis 
      confirmed the EFA findings. Results indicated acceptable convergent and 
      discriminant validity. The AES-S is a reliable instrument to quantify apathy in 
      cognitively healthy middle-aged individuals at risk for AD. DISCUSSION: This 
      study demonstrates the AES-S is a psychometrically sound measurement tool for 
      assessing levels of apathy in a cognitively healthy middle-aged cohort at risk 
      for AD.

TI  - Clinical characteristics associated with therapeutic nonadherence of the patients 
      with major depressive disorder: A report on the National Survey on Symptomatology 
      of Depression in China.
PG  - 215-222
LID - 10.1111/cns.13030 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Nonadherence is one of the leading challenges to treatment of the major 
      depressive disorder (MDD). Few studies have systematically analyzed the 
      relationship between clinical characteristics, especially symptoms of depressive 
      patients and their therapeutic nonadherence over a relatively large sample. This 
      study aimed to investigate factors of nonadherence in a nationwide survey in 
      China. METHODS: Participants with MDD who met the criteria of Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV) were recruited 
      from 32 sites throughout China. Patients were all over 16 years old. A 
      doctor-rating questionnaire with 64 symptoms based on DSM-IV was constructed to 
      evaluate depression-related feeling and behavior. Single-factor logistic 
      regression was utilized to screen variables, and multifactor logistic regressive 
      analysis was used to identify which factors were risk or protective for 
      nonadherence. We included 882 patients of poor adherence and 857 patients of good 
      adherence. RESULTS: Recurrence, untreated first episode, tricyclic antidepressant 
      (TCA)-treated first episode, antidepressant-only-treated current episode, 
      decrease or loss of interest, more somatic symptoms, and "atypical" symptoms were 
      risk factors for nonadherence, whereas selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor 
      (SNRI)-treated first episode was a protecting factor. CONCLUSION: Clinical 
      characteristics may play an important role in predicting nonadherence. Doctors 
      may have to pay much attention on patients with these factors and should keep on 
      discussing them with patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The concept of symptomatic and functional remission represents an 
      important challenge in the care of the mentally ill, particularly in patients 
      with schizophrenia. Operational criteria for symptomatic remission in 
      schizophrenia have been proposed by Andreasen et al. (2005). Over the last 
      decade, these criteria have been widely validated; however few studies have been 
      conducted outside developed countries. Moreover, the association of symptomatic 
      remission with functional outcome has not yet been established in developing 
      countries including Tunisia, as there may be variability in the social and 
      familial environment. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency and associated 
      factors of symptomatic remission in a sample of Tunisian out-patients with 
      schizophrenia and to explore the relationship between symptomatic remission and 
      some indicators of social functioning. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was 
      carried-out on 115 out-patients with schizophrenia (87 males, 28 females, mean 
      age=37.56±10.2 years) in the psychiatry department of the university hospital in 
      Monastir (Tunisia). Nearly all of the patients (98.26%) had been hospitalized at 
      least once in a psychiatric unit. The last hospitalization dated back to 39 
      months on average (range=6 months to 16 years). Symptomatic remission was 
      assessed by the eight core items of the positive and negative syndrome scale 
      (PANSS). These are the items P1 "Delusions"; P3 "Hallucinatory behavior" and G9 
      "Unusual thought content" for the positive dimension, the items P2 "Conceptual 
      disorganization" and G5 "Mannerism and disorders of posture" for the 
      disorganization dimension and the items N1 "Blunted affect", N4 "Social 
      withdrawal" and N6 "Lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation" for the 
      negative dimension. A score of mild or less on all eight-core symptoms 
      constitutes symptomatic remission. This symptom level should have been maintained 
      for six months. The social functioning was assessed by the Social and 
      Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) and the Social Autonomy Scale 
      (SAS) exploring personal care, management of daily life, resource management, the 
      relationship with the outside and the emotional life and relationships social. A 
      multivariate analysis using a binary logistic regression was conducted with as a 
      dependent variable "symptomatic remission" and as explanatory variables the 
      associated variables with symptomatic remission in bivariate analysis with age 
      and gender. RESULTS: The symptomatic remission was observed in 50.4% of patients. 
      The items corresponding to positive dimension (P1, P3 and G9) and the item P2 
      "conceptual disorganization" had a better predictive value of symptomatic 
      remission. After multivariate analysis, the associated factors of symptomatic 
      remission were the acute of onset (P=0.026), the low score of negative symptoms 
      during the last hospitalization (P=0.017) and the episodic course (P<0.0001). 
      However, age or gender of the patients, educational or socioeconomic level, 
      psychiatric family history, age of onset, duration of untreated psychosis, number 
      and duration of previous hospitalizations, antipsychotic treatment dosage were 
      not associated with symptomatic remission in our sample. The mean score of the 
      SOFAS was 48.47±14.44, and the mean score of the SAS was 56.6±16.84. A 
      significant association was shown between the SOFAS score and the symptomatic 
      remission (P<0.0001) and between the SAS score and the symptomatic remission 
      (P<0.0001). Moreover, a significant association was found between symptomatic 
      remission and occupational activity (P=0.03). CONCLUSION: The frequency of 
      symptomatic remission according the PANSS criteria in our sample is above the 
      average of the reported rates in literature (30 to 60%). This can be explained by 
      the frequency of symptomatic remission in outpatient versus inpatients, or in 
      relation to the notion of a more favorable course of schizophrenia in developing 
      countries, although this notion is controversial. Remitter patients had 
      significantly an acute onset of disorders, a low score of negative symptoms 
      during the last hospitalization and an episodic course. They also showed a 
      significant trend for better social functioning. In fact, a significant 
      association was shown in our sample between symptomatic remission and social 
      functioning. These results suggest that the concept of remission has important 
      implications for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Relationship of Physical Frailty to Phosphocreatine Recovery in Muscle after Mild 
      Exercise Stress in the Oldest-Old Women.
PG  - 162-168
LID - 10.14283/jfa.2019.21 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical frailty is a clinical syndrome associated with aging and 
      manifesting as slowness, weakness, reduced physical activity, weight loss, and/or 
      exhaustion. Frail older adults often report that their major problem is "low 
      energy", and there is indirect evidence to support the hypothesis that frailty is 
      a syndrome of dysregulated energetics. We hypothesized that altered cellular 
      energy production underlies compromised response to stressors in the frail. 
      METHODS: We conducted a pilot study to assess muscle energetics in response to a 
      mild isometric exercise challenge in women (n=30) ages 84-93 years. The frailty 
      status was assessed by a validated physical frailty instrument. Localized 
      phosphorus (P31) magnetic resonance spectroscopy with a 1.5T magnet was used to 
      assess the kinetics of Phosphocreatine recovery in the tibialis anterior muscle 
      following maximal isometric contraction for 30 seconds. RESULTS: Phosphocreatine 
      recovery following exertion, age-adjusted, was slowest in the frail group 
      (mean=189 sec; 95%CI: 150,228) compared to pre-frail (mean=152 sec; 95%CI: 
      107,197) and nonfrail subjects (mean=132 sec; 95%CI: 40,224). The pre-frail and 
      frail groups had 20 sec (95%CI: -49,89) and 57 sec (95%CI: -31,147) slower 
      phosphocreatine recovery, respectively, than the non-frail. This response was 
      paralleled by dysregulation in glucose recovery in response to oral glucose 
      tolerance test in women from the same study population. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired 
      muscle energetics and energy metabolism might be implicated in the physical 
      frailty syndrome.

TI  - Screening Properties of the Diagnostic Criteria for Cancer-Related Fatigue.
PG  - 440-447
LID - 10.1159/000501128 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Within the theoretical framework of the ICD diagnostic criteria of 
      cancer-related fatigue, we aim to investigate how those criteria can be used for 
      screening purposes. METHODS: Fatigue was assessed in a mixed sample of 1,225 
      cancer patients during their stay in a rehabilitation clinic using four different 
      fatigue measures and the diagnostic criteria (Criterion A; DC-A). Psychometric 
      evaluations (e.g., acceptance, reliability, validity, item analyses) were 
      conducted for the sum score and for all items of the diagnostic criteria. 
      RESULTS: A total of 678 (57.1%) patients tested positive according to the DC-A. 
      The sum score of the DC-A had good reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87) and 
      validity, corresponded closely with other fatigue scales, and, with less than 1% 
      missing values, showed a high degree of patients' acceptance. The highest 
      accuracy (approx. 0.80) and Youden indices (>0.55) were found for the items 
      "Difficulties completing daily tasks" (A9), "Struggle to overcome inactivity" 
      (A7), "Decreased motivation or interests" (A4), and "Unrefreshing sleep" (A6). 
      CONCLUSION: The DC-A proved to be a well-accepted, easy to use, and reliable tool 
      for measuring the severity of fatigue. In this paper, we make suggestions for the 
      use of single items of the DC-A as a short and economical screening tool.

      Results from PACO Prospective Study.
PG  - 1099-1108
LID - 10.3233/JAD-190183 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Premorbid personality could play a role in the onset of behavioral 
      and psychological symptoms (BPS) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but prospective 
      studies are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed at prospectively 
      assessing the influence of premorbid personality traits on BPS evolution in a 
      population of patients with prodromal or mild AD. METHODS: We used a multicenter 
      prospective cohort study of 237 patients followed-up for 18 months. The influence 
      of personality traits on BPS evolution, measured with Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
      (NPI), was assessed using linear mixed-effect models. RESULTS: A principal 
      components analysis of the 12 NPI behavioral domains yielded five factors 
      labelled as psychotic symptoms, affective symptoms, behavioral dyscontrol, 
      apathy/appetite symptoms, and sleep disorders. During the follow-up, higher 
      neuroticism was significantly associated with a higher progression of affective 
      symptoms (p < 0.0001), apathy/appetite symptoms (p = 0.002), sleep disorders 
      (p = 0.001) as well as global NPI scores (p < 0.0001). Greater conscientiousness 
      was related to a lower evolution of psychotic (p = 0.002), affective (p = 0.02) 
      and apathy/appetite symptoms (p = 0.02), and global NPI score (p < 0.0001). 
      Higher openness was associated with lower affective symptoms evolution 
      (p = 0.01). A significant relationship was found between higher extraversion, 
      lower affective symptoms (p = 0.02), and higher behavioral dyscontrol (p = 0.04). 
      CONCLUSION: The present analysis suggests that premorbid personality may 
      influence the evolution of BPS in prodromal or mild AD. Given these results, it 
      seems important to give more importance to personality assessment in early AD, in 
      order to better identify and manage patients at risk of adverse behavioral 
      changes.

TI  - Detecting Apathy in Older Adults with Cognitive Disorders Using Automatic Speech 
      Analysis.
PG  - 1183-1193
LID - 10.3233/JAD-181033 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is present in several psychiatric and neurological conditions 
      and has been found to have a severe negative effect on disease progression. In 
      older people, it can be a predictor of increased dementia risk. Current 
      assessment methods lack objectivity and sensitivity, thus new diagnostic tools 
      and broad-scale screening technologies are needed. OBJECTIVE: This study is the 
      first of its kind aiming to investigate whether automatic speech analysis could 
      be used for characterization and detection of apathy. METHODS: A group of 
      apathetic and non-apathetic patients (n = 60) with mild to moderate 
      neurocognitive disorder were recorded while performing two short narrative speech 
      tasks. Paralinguistic markers relating to prosodic, formant, source, and temporal 
      qualities of speech were automatically extracted, examined between the groups and 
      compared to baseline assessments. Machine learning experiments were carried out 
      to validate the diagnostic power of extracted markers. RESULTS: Correlations 
      between apathy sub-scales and features revealed a relation between temporal 
      aspects of speech and the subdomains of reduction in interest and initiative, as 
      well as between prosody features and the affective domain. Group differences were 
      found to vary for males and females, depending on the task. Differences in 
      temporal aspects of speech were found to be the most consistent difference 
      between apathetic and non-apathetic patients. Machine learning models trained on 
      speech features achieved top performances of AUC = 0.88 for males and AUC = 0.77 
      for females. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reinforce the usability of speech as a 
      reliable biomarker in the detection and assessment of apathy.

      psychological symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 46-54
LID - 10.1111/psyg.12363 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Evidence describing the contribution of cerebral white matter disease and 
      medial temporal atrophy (MTA) to behavioural and psychological symptoms of 
      dementia (BPSD) has been conflicting. The aim of this study was to assess the 
      relationship of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and MTA observed on magnetic 
      resonance imaging with BPSD among patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: In 
      a cross-sectional study of a prospective cohort of patients attending a memory 
      clinic, 46 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (mean age: 72.38 ± 7.05 
      years) were studied. Sociodemographic, cognitive, and BPSD data were collected. 
      BPSD were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Magnetic resonance 
      imaging, WMH, and MTA were rated using the Scheltens scales for the assessment of 
      signal hyperintensities and atrophy of medial temporal lobes. For multivariate 
      analysis, two binary logistic regression analyses were carried out, with presence 
      or absence of each BPSD as the dependent variable and with WMH or MTA as the 
      predictor variable. Results of the logistic regression were analyzed to see if 
      the significance of the WMH or MTA score was maintained in a model that factored 
      in other possible confounding variables identified in univariate analysis. 
      RESULTS: The results of binary logistic regression analysis showed that in models 
      that accounted for confounding variables, increased total MTA was significantly 
      associated with apathy (odds ratio = 1.605, adjusted P = 0.042) and disinhibition 
      (odds ratio = 0.607, adjusted P = 0.042). WMH measures did not significantly 
      predict any BPSD item. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that MTA potentially 
      contributes to the aetiology of BPSD, and they provide evidence to support the 
      hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease pathology itself can contribute to BPSD.

PG  - 16-21

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although apathy is a common psychiatric symptom of Parkinson's 
      disease (PD), there are many unknown aspects of its pathology. This study aimed 
      to investigate the characteristics of apathy in treatment-naïve patients with 
      early-stage PD. METHODS: Fifty treatment-naïve patients with early-stage PD were 
      divided into 1 of 2 groups-apathetic or non-apathetic-based on Starkstein Apathy 
      Scale (AS) scores. Cognitive function, depressive symptoms, olfactory function, 
      and motor severity were compared between the two groups using validated 
      assessment scales. Multiple linear regression was performed to assess the 
      association between AS scores and clinical parameters. RESULTS: Apathy (AS score 
      ≥16) was observed in 13 (26%) patients. Assessment scale scores (Beck Depression 
      Inventory-Second Edition [p < .004]; modified Hoehn & Yahr stage [p = .039]; 
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III [p < .001]) were significantly 
      higher in apathetic patients than in non-apathetic patients. Significant 
      association between these scale scores and AS score was also evident (all p ≤ 
      .001). There were no significant differences in the test scores derived from 
      several other validated scales. CONCLUSION: Apathy was observed in 26% of 
      treatment-naïve patients with early-stage PD. Significant association between 
      apathy and motor severity was found, suggesting that dysfunction of the 
      dopaminergic pathway is involved in the pathology of apathy.

TI  - Does the Geriatric Depression Scale measure depression in Parkinson's disease?
PG  - 1662-1670
LID - 10.1002/gps.4970 [doi]
AB  - The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is recommended for screening depression in 
      individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Empirical evidence, however, is 
      limited regarding its validity and factor structure in PD. Thus, the current 
      study sought to evaluate the convergent and divergent validity of the GDS, as 
      well as the structure and validity of the derived factors. METHOD: Nondemented 
      individuals with PD (n = 158) completed the GDS-30, and items were subjected to a 
      principle component analysis. Geriatric Depression Scale total and factor scores 
      were correlated with depression items from the Movement Disorder Society Unified 
      Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRSd) and Hamilton Rating Scale for 
      Depression (HAMDd), as well as with the Apathy Scale (AS), State-Trait Anxiety 
      Inventory (STAI), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Parkinson's disease Sleep 
      Scale, and a Subjective Cognitive Function composite score. RESULTS: The GDS 
      total score was strongly correlated with divergent neuropsychiatric measures (AS, 
      r = 0.57; STAI, r = 0.66; MFIS, r = 0.60), while only moderately correlated with 
      convergent measures (MDS-UPDRSd, r = 0.36; HAMDd, r = 0.32; Ps < 0.05). Linear 
      regression analyses revealed standardized measures of anxiety, apathy, and 
      fatigue independently predicted the GDS total score, while depression items 
      (MDS-UPDRSd and HAMDd) failed to reach significance. Three independent factors 
      were identified: Anxiety, Apathy, and Fatigue. These factors were significantly 
      predicted by their respective convergent measures. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, 
      our findings suggest that the GDS and its subscales appear to primarily measure 
      anxiety, apathy, and fatigue in PD, or alternatively, these symptom dimensions 
      may be predominant in PD-depression. Future research with clinically diagnosed 
      samples is needed to confirm these initial findings.

AB  - This study explores the psychometric characteristics of the Behavior Problems 
      Inventory (BPI), an instrument for routine clinical assessment of behavior 
      problems in outpatients with psychosis based on information provided by key 
      family informants. Six hundred and twenty-one patients diagnosed with psychosis 
      and bipolar affective disorder (ICD-10 F20-F31) attended at Community Mental 
      Health Units were evaluated in routine reviews using the BPI and the Social 
      Functioning Scale (SFS). Twenty-five subjects were simultaneously administered 
      the Social Behavior Schedule (SBS) and 28 were again administered the BPI eight 
      weeks later. The instrument shows adequate psychometric characteristics with high 
      internal consistency and robust temporal reliability, as well as satisfactory 
      concurrent and construct validity. Factor analysis identified three factors: 
      Underactivity/Social Withdrawal, Active Problems and Lack of Impulse Control, 
      with adequate saturation of the items on each of the factors. The BPI is easy to 
      apply, reliable and valid, takes up little of valuable clinical time, allowing 
      routine assessment in public service contexts for persons diagnosed with 
      psychosis and bipolar affective disorder for whom key family informants are 
      available.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The distress thermometer (DT) has been studied and validated as an 
      effective screening instrument for identifying distress among cancer patients 
      worldwide. This study aims to evaluate the validity of the Arabic version of the 
      DT in Saudi cancer patients, to define the optimal cutoff point of the Arabic DT 
      for detecting clinically significant distress and to determine whether there is 
      any correlation between clinically significant distress and other demographic and 
      Problem List variables. METHODS: The original form of the DT was translated to 
      Arabic using a forward and backward translation method. Then, a group of 247 
      cancer patients who were followed up at the Outpatient Oncology Clinic at King 
      Saud Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, completed a socio-demographic and 
      clinical status questionnaire, the DT and the Problem List scale, and the 
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: Receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) curve analyses picked out an area under the curve of 0.76 
      when compared with a HADS cutoff score of 15. The DT had the best sensitivity 
      (0.70) and specificity (0.63) with cutoff score of 4. A DT score of 4 or more was 
      found to have a statistically significant correlation with female gender, 
      advanced cancer stages and most of the Problem List items, including child care, 
      work or school, treatment decision, dealing with children and partners, 
      depression, fears, nervousness, sadness, loss of interest in usual activity, 
      religious concerns, appearance, bathing/dressing, breathing, diarrhea, fatigue, 
      feeling swollen, fever, getting around, indigestion, memory and concentration, 
      nausea, dry nose, pain, and sexual problems. In contrast, a multivariate 
      regression analysis confirmed only advanced cancer stages, treatment decision, 
      depression, fear, sadness, worry, breathing, feeling swollen, fever, indigestion, 
      memory and concentration, dry nose and congestion, pain and sleep as independent 
      factors associated with distress in cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found the 
      Arabic version of the DT to be a valid instrument for screening distress in Saudi 
      patients with cancer. Our study proposes using a cutoff score of 4 as an 
      indicator of clinically significant distress in this population.

TI  - Changes in Body Mass Index and Physical Activity Predict Changes in Vitality 
      During a Weight Loss Trial in Breast Cancer Survivors.
PG  - 999-1009
LID - 10.1093/abm/kay004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survivors rank fatigue (e.g., decreased vitality) as 
      their number one concern affecting quality of life. Excess adiposity is 
      associated with decreased vitality in breast cancer survivors, yet weight loss 
      intervention trials report inconsistent effects on this parameter. METHODS: This 
      is a secondary analysis of the Exercise and Nutrition to Enhance Recovery and 
      Good Health for You trial, in which 692 overweight or obese breast cancer 
      survivors ≤5 years from diagnosis, initiated weight loss interventions, and 
      completed assessments semi-annually for 2 years. Assessments included the Godin 
      Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire and the SF-36 MOS vitality subscale as an 
      inverse measure of fatigue. Multilevel structural equation models estimated the 
      direct effects of physical activity on vitality and indirect effects through body 
      mass index (BMI) changes. RESULTS: Within-person findings show that at 
      assessments with greater physical activity, BMI was significantly lower (B = 
      -0.07, p < 0.001) and vitality was higher (B = 0.22, p < 0.001). However, there 
      was no direct relationship between lower BMI and higher vitality (B = -0.11, p = 
      0.262) after controlling for the relationship of physical activity with BMI and 
      physical activity with vitality. The between-person indirect effect of physical 
      activity change through BMI change to vitality was significant (B = 0.03, p < 
      0.001). Participants whose physical activity was above the mean (B = 0.37, p < 
      0.001) and whose BMI was below the mean (B = -1.05, p < 0.001) were more likely 
      to report greater vitality. CONCLUSION: Improvements in vitality are primarily 
      associated with increases in physical activity rather than BMI changes in this 
      trial. Vitality was lower among survivors with higher BMI, although 
      within-individual changes in BMI had no effect on vitality. Physical activity and 
      weight loss share mechanistic links to vitality with physical activity 
      potentially increasing (e.g., in an additive or synergistic manner) the effect of 
      BMI reduction on vitality.

TI  - [The behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in down syndrome (BPSD-DS) 
      scale: comprehensive assessment of psychopathology in down syndrome].
PG  - 187-205
LID - 10.1007/s12439-018-0262-8 [doi]
AB  - Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) have not been 
      comprehensively studied in people with Down syndrome, despite their high risk on 
      dementia. A novel evaluation scale was developed to identify the nature, 
      frequency and severity of behavioral changes (83 behavioral items in 12 
      clinically defined sections). Central aim was to identify items that change in 
      relation to the dementia status. Structured interviews were conducted with 
      informants of people with Down syndrome without dementia (DS, N = 149), with 
      questionable dementia (DS + TD, N = 65) and with diagnosed dementia (DS + AD, 
      N = 67). Group comparisons showed a pronounced increase in frequency and severity 
      of items about anxiety, sleep disturbances, agitation & stereotypical behavior, 
      aggression, apathy, depressive symptoms, and, eating/drinking behavior. The 
      proportion of individuals presenting an increase was highest in the DS + AD group 
      and lowest in the DS group. Interestingly, among DS + TD individuals, 
      a substantial proportion already presented increased anxiety, sleep disturbances, 
      apathy and depressive symptoms, suggesting that these changes may be early alarm 
      signals of dementia. The scale may contribute to a better understanding of the 
      changes, adapting daily care/support, and providing suitable therapies to people 
      with Down syndrome. The scale needs to be optimized based on the results and 
      experiences. The applicability, reliability and validity require further study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a frequent symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), 
      substantially aggravating the course of PD. Regarding the accumulating evidence 
      of the key role of apathy in PD, time-efficient assessments are useful for 
      fostering progress in research and treatment. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) 
      is widely used for the assessment of apathy across different nosologies. 
      OBJECTIVE: To facilitate the application of the AES in PD, we reduced the AES to 
      two-thirds its length and validated this abbreviated version. DESIGN: Data sets 
      of 339 PD patients of the DEMPARK/LANDSCAPE study without dementia and depression 
      were randomly split into two samples. Data of sample 1 were used to develop a 
      brief version of the AES (AES-12PD). A cross-validation was conducted in sample 2 
      and in a subsample of 42 PD patients with comorbid dementia and depressive 
      symptomatology. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was applied to 
      determine the optimal cutoff of the AES-12PD as an indicator of apathy. RESULTS: 
      The AES-12PD featured high internal consistency that was better compared to the 
      AES. The abbreviated scale was well differentiated from motor impairment and 
      cognitive deficits. The AES-12PD cutoff of 27/28 was the optimal cutoff for 
      apathy in PD patients without dementia and depression. The cutoff of 25/26 
      indicated apathy in PD patients with comorbid dementia and depression. 
      CONCLUSION: Results confirm a high internal consistency and good discriminant 
      validity of the AES-12PD. The AES-12PD represents a reliable tool for the 
      efficient assessment of apathy that can be applied in PD patients with and 
      without dementia and depression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is commonly used in research and 
      clinical settings for screening of depression. The current study aimed to examine 
      the best-fit factor structure model of the GDS among Chinese elders and to 
      evaluate the measurement invariance of the GDS across genders. METHODS: 
      Participants included 1,553 elderly residents from the Hunan, Shandong, and 
      Beijing provinces. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor 
      analysis (CFA) were conducted in tandem to determine the structure of the GDS on 
      a large scale. Multigroup CFA (N = 1553, 45.24% male, mean = 71.33 ± 8.06) was 
      utilized to test the measurement invariance of the depressive symptom structure, 
      which was generated by EFA and confirmed by CFA across gender. RESULTS: A 
      three-factor model with 15 depression, 9 apathy and 4 vigor items presented the 
      best fit indices. Measurement invariance of the new proposed model across gender 
      was supported fully assuming different degrees of invariance. LIMITATIONS: Our 
      sample was entirely Chinese, and thus may not be representative of populations 
      outside of China. Our results are based on a cross-sectional study, which did not 
      take into consideration changes that may occur over time within individuals. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A three-factor model best fits the depressive symptom structure of 
      the GDS among elderly Chinese, with measurement invariance across genders.

TI  - Adherence to a Mediterranean diet is associated with lower incidence of frailty: 
      A longitudinal cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is a paucity of data investigating the relationship 
      between the Mediterranean diet and frailty, with no data among North American 
      people. We aimed to investigate if adherence to a Mediterranean diet is 
      associated with a lower incidence of frailty in a large cohort of North American 
      people. METHODS: This study included subjects at higher risk or having knee 
      osteoarthritis. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was evaluated using a 
      validated Mediterranean diet score (aMED) as proposed by Panagiotakos and 
      classified into five categories. Frailty was defined using the Study of 
      Osteoporotic Fracture (SOF) index as the presence of ≥2 out of: (i) weight loss 
      ≥5% between baseline and the subsequent follow-up visit; (ii) inability to do 
      five chair stands; (iii) low energy level. RESULTS: During the 8 years follow-up, 
      of the 4421 participants initially included (mean age: 61.2 years, % of 
      females = 58.0), the incidence of frailty was approximately half in those with a 
      higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet (8 for 1000 person years) vs. those 
      with a lower adherence (15 for 1000 persons-years). After adjusting for 10 
      potential confounders (age, sex, race, body mass index, education, smoking 
      habits, yearly income, physical activity level, Charlson co-morbidity index and 
      daily energy intake), participants with the highest aMED scores were found to 
      have a significant reduction in incident frailty (hazard ratio = 0.71; 95% CIs: 
      0.50-0.99, p = 0.047) with respect to those in a lower category. Regarding 
      individual components of the Mediterranean diet, low consumption of poultry was 
      found to be associated with higher risk of frailty. CONCLUSIONS: A higher 
      adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower incidence of 
      frailty over an 8-year follow-up period, even after adjusting for potential 
      confounders.

TI  - Social Withdrawal Among Individuals Receiving Psychiatric Care: Derivation of a 
      Scale Using Routine Clinical Assessment Data to Support Screening and Outcome 
      Measurement.
PG  - 579-592
LID - 10.1007/s11414-017-9554-y [doi]
AB  - Social withdrawal is a symptom experienced by individuals with an array of mental 
      health conditions, particularly those with schizophrenia and mood disorders. 
      Assessments of social withdrawal are often lengthy and may not be routinely 
      integrated within the comprehensive clinical assessment of the individual. This 
      study utilized item response and classical test theory methods to derive a Social 
      Withdrawal Scale (SWS) using items embedded within a routine clinical assessment, 
      the RAI-Mental Health (RAI-MH). Using data from 60,571 inpatients in Ontario, 
      Canada, a common factor analysis identified seven items from the RAI-MH that 
      measure social withdrawal. A graded response model found that six items had 
      acceptable discrimination parameters: lack of motivation, reduced interaction, 
      decreased energy, flat affect, anhedonia, and loss of interest. Summing these 
      items, the SWS was found to have strong internal consistency (Cronbach's 
      alpha = 0.82) and showed a medium to large effect size (d = 0.77) from admission 
      to discharge. Fewer individuals with high SWS scores participated in social 
      activity or reported having a confidant compared to those with lower scores. 
      Since the RAI-MH is available across clinical subgroups in several jurisdictions, 
      the SWS is a useful tool for screening, clinical decision support, and 
      evaluation.

TI  - Which levels of cognitive impairments and negative symptoms are related to 
      functional deficits in schizophrenia?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Negative symptoms and cognitive impairments predict difficulties in 
      aspects of everyday functioning in schizophrenia, with little research to date 
      attempting to determine if there are threshold levels of impairment required to 
      predict the severity of functional deficits. METHODS: People diagnosed with 
      chronic schizophrenia (n = 821) were assessed with the MCCB and PANSS, and rated 
      by high contact informants with SLOF. Negative symptoms of reduced emotional 
      experience were specifically targeted for analysis because of their previously 
      identified relationships with social outcomes. We identified patients with 
      moderate negative symptoms (at least one PANSS item ≥4) versus less severe 
      symptoms (PANSS items ≤3) and divided patients on the basis of a single 
      latent-trait global cognition score (neuropsychologically normal vs 
      neuropsychologically impaired; performance at or below 1.0 SD from the normative 
      population mean, T = 40), then examined correlations between cognition, negative 
      symptoms and everyday functioning in the groups with lower and higher negative 
      symptoms and those with/without cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Even low levels of 
      negative symptoms were correlated with ratings of social functioning. Cognitive 
      performance in the neuropsychologically normal range, in contrast, was not 
      correlated with any aspects of everyday functioning while more impaired 
      performance predicted greater functional impairments. CONCLUSIONS: Even minimal 
      symptoms may be a target for clinical attention in the domains of negative 
      symptoms, consistent with previous findings regarding social deficits in 
      populations with modest negative symptoms (e.g., schizotypal personality 
      disorder). Cognitive rehabilitation treatments might not improve social 
      functioning if even low levels of negative symptoms (social amotivation) are 
      present.

TI  - Reliability and validity of the self-report version of the apathy evaluation

AB  - Negative symptoms have traditionally been assessed based on clinicians' 
      observations. The subjective experience of negative symptoms in people with 
      psychosis may bring new insight. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is commonly 
      used to study apathy in psychosis and has corresponding self-rated (AES-S) and 
      clinician-rated (AES-C) versions. The aim of the present study was to determine 
      the validity and reliability of the AES-S by investigating its concordance with 
      the AES-C. Eighty-four first-episode (FEP) patients completed the shortened 
      12-item AES-S and AES-C at baseline (T1) and 12 months (T2). Concordance was 
      studied by degree of correlation, comparison of mean scores, and change and 
      difference between diagnostic groups. The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale 
      (PANSS) was used to study convergent and discriminative properties. High 
      concordance was found between AES-S and AES-C at both T1 and T2 regarding mean 
      values, change from T1 to T2, and the proportion with high levels of apathy. Both 
      versions indicated high levels of apathy in FEP, while associations with PANSS 
      negative symptoms were weaker for AES-S than AES-C. Controlling for depression 
      did not significantly alter results. We concluded that self-rated apathy in FEP 
      patients is in concordance with clinician ratings, but in need of further study.

LID - 1758
AB  - A valid method to diagnose depression in palliative care has not been 
      established. In this study, we aim to determine the prevalence of depression and 
      the discriminant validity of the items of four sets of diagnostic criteria in 
      palliative care. This is a cross-sectional study on 240 palliative care patients 
      where the presence of depression was based on the Diagnostic and Statistical 
      Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM⁻IV Criteria, Modified DSM⁻IV Criteria, Cavanaugh 
      Criteria, and Endicott's Criteria's. Anxiety, depression, and distress were 
      measured with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Distress Thermometer. The 
      prevalence of depression among the palliative care patients was highest based on 
      the Modified DSM⁻IV Criteria (23.3%), followed by the Endicott's Criteria 
      (13.8%), DSM⁻IV Criteria (9.2%), and Cavanaugh Criteria (5%). There were 
      significant differences (p < 0.05) in the depressive symptoms showed by DSM⁻IV 
      item 1 (dysphoric mood), item 2 (loss of interest or pleasure), and Endicott's 
      criteria item 8 (brooding, self-pity, or pessimism) among the palliative 
      patients, even after adjustment for the anxiety symptoms and distress level. We 
      found that dysphoric mood, loss of interest, and pessimism are the main features 
      of depression in palliative patients. These symptoms should be given more 
      attention in identifying depression in palliative care patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To develop a Cancer Self-Perceived Discrimination Scale (CSPDS) for 
      Chinese cancer patients and to assess its reliability and validity. METHOD: A 
      total of 178 patients were recruited and the classical test theory was used to 
      develop the CSPDS. Item analysis was adapted to improve the preliminary version 
      of the CSPDS, then the reliability, the validity and the acceptability of the 
      final version of CSPDS were assessed. RESULTS: This CSPDS contained 14 items 
      classified into 3 subscales: social withdrawal with 7 items, stigma with 4 and 
      self-deprecation with 3. Good validity (χ(2)/df = 1.216, GFI = 0.935, 
      AGFI = 0.903, I-CVIs> 0.80) and good reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.829, 
      Spearman-Brown coefficient = 0.827, test-retest reliability coefficient = 0.944) 
      were found. The completion time was 6.06 ± 1.80 min. Participants who were female 
      and reported poor self-rated health tended to have higher CSPDS scores 
      (P <  0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that this CSPDS could be used to 
      assess the level of self-perceived discrimination and to preliminarily screen 
      perceived discrimination among Chinese cancer patients, especially in Southwest 
      China. It may provide a basis for scientific assessment of targeted patient 
      education, psychological counseling, social interventions, and psychotherapy in 
      the future.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Post-stroke depression (PSD) and post-stroke apathy (PSA) are both 
      associated with adverse outcome after stroke. This study aimed to examine whether 
      personality traits predict the course of PSD and PSA. METHODS: In this 
      prospective cohort study, 240 stroke patients completed the NEO Five Factor 
      Inventory, Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, and Apathy Evaluation Scale 
      at 3 months post-stroke. Neuropsychiatric assessment was repeated at 6- and 
      12-month follow-up after initial testing. RESULTS: Linear mixed models showed 
      that high neuroticism scores were associated with higher depression levels at 
      baseline, and this association remained stable at follow-up. High extraversion 
      scores and high conscientiousness scores were associated with lower apathy levels 
      at baseline. For neuroticism, a significant interaction with time was found, with 
      higher neuroticism scores at baseline being associated with an increase in apathy 
      scores from 6-month to 12-month follow-up. Prospective analyses showed that high 
      extraversion predicted low apathy levels at 6-month and 12-month follow-up 
      independent of its relations with baseline depression and apathy. High 
      neuroticism predicted high apathy levels at 12-month follow-up, whereas high 
      agreeableness and high openness predicted high apathy levels and low apathy 
      levels, respectively, at 6-month follow-up. None of the personality traits 
      predicted depression scores at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Personality traits are 
      associated with the development and sustainability of PSD and PSA. The traits 
      associated with PSD and PSA were different, providing support for the 
      independence of these constructs. The findings highlight the importance to take 
      personality traits into account as a potential vulnerability factor for PSD and 
      PSA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), such as cognitive, 
      emotional, autonomic and somatosensory alterations, are not ubiquitous but vary 
      between the tremor dominant (TD) and postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) 
      subtypes of the syndrome. Non-motor phenomena (e.g., anxiety, depression and 
      apathy) have been related to representation of autonomic and somatosensory 
      sensations (interoception), and recent findings suggest interoceptive deficits in 
      PD. OBJECTIVES: To test whether interoceptive processing is differently affected 
      in TD and PIGD phenotypes, by assessing both interoceptive accuracy and 
      sensibility in PD patients with TD and PIGD subtypes, and in healthy controls. 
      METHODS: Interoceptive accuracy was measured by the heartbeat perception task 
      requiring participants to count their own heartbeats in a given time interval. A 
      time-estimation, control task was also administered asking participants to count 
      the seconds in a set period of time. Interoceptive sensibility was assessed by a 
      questionnaire of subjective interoception. Finally, the patients underwent 
      measures of anxiety, depression, apathy and anhedonia, and impulsive-compulsive 
      disturbances. RESULTS: The main results showed reduced interoceptive accuracy and 
      sensibility in TD patients relative to both PIGD patients and healthy controls. 
      Reduced interoceptive accuracy of TD group was a reliable result since their 
      performance on the time estimation control task was comparable to that of both 
      PIGD patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that 
      the behavioural assessment of different aspects of interoceptive processing can 
      provide with a further marker for subtyping patients with PD.

TI  - Psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Cognitive Reserve Scale 
      (I-CRS).
PG  - 1383-1390
LID - 10.1007/s10072-018-3432-0 [doi]
AB  - The original definition of cognitive reserve (CR) refers to the individual 
      differences in cognitive performance after a brain damage or pathology. Several 
      proxies were proposed to evaluate CR (education, occupational attainment, 
      premorbid IQ, leisure activities). Recently, some scales were developed to 
      measure CR taking into account several cognitively stimulating activities. The 
      aim of this study is to adapt the Cognitive Reserve Scale (I-CRS) for the Italian 
      population and to explore its psychometric properties. I-CRS was administered to 
      547 healthy participants, ranging from 18 to 89 years old, along with 
      neuropsychological and behavioral scales to evaluate cognitive functioning, 
      depressive symptoms, and apathy. Cronbach's α, corrected item-total correlations, 
      and the inter-item correlation matrix were calculated to evaluate the 
      psychometric properties of the scale. Linear regression analysis was performed to 
      build a correction grid of the I-CRS according to demographic variables. 
      Correlational analyses were performed to explore the relationships between I-CRS 
      and neuropsychological and behavioral scales. We found that age, sex, and 
      education influenced the I-CRS score. Young adults and adults obtained higher 
      I-CRS scores than elderly adults; women and participants with high educational 
      attainment scored higher on I-CRS than men and participants with low education. 
      I-CRS score correlated poorly with cognitive and depression scale scores, but 
      moderately with apathy scale scores. I-CRS showed good psychometric properties 
      and seemed to be a useful tool to assess CR in every adult life stage. Moreover, 
      our findings suggest that apathy rather than depressive symptoms may interfere 
      with the building of CR across the lifespan.

TI  - Identifying reliable predictors of protein-energy malnutrition in hospitalized 
      frail older adults: A prospective longitudinal study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Decreased food intake is a risk factor for relevant complications 
      (e.g. infections, pressure ulcers), longer hospital stays, higher readmission 
      rates, greater health care costs and increased patient mortality, particularly in 
      frail hospitalized older adults who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition. 
      Nurses are called to improve this criticality, starting from accurately 
      identifying malnourished patients at hospital admission and effectively 
      monitoring their food intake. OBJECTIVES: The primary aim was to identify 
      reliable predictive indicators of reduced food intake at hospital admission. The 
      secondary aims were to assess the adequacy of daily energy and protein intake and 
      the impact of nutrient intake on patient outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective 
      observational longitudinal study. SETTING: Internal Medicine Ward of an Academic 
      Teaching University Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Acute older adults who were 
      malnourished or at risk of malnutrition (Nutritional Risk Score-2002 ≥ 3, 
      middle-upper arm circumference <23.5 cm or impaired self-feeding ability) at 
      admission. METHODS: The effective energy and protein intake was monitored during 
      the first 5 days of hospital stay by a photographic method and compared to the 
      daily energy and protein requirement calculated by specific equations. Data on 
      anthropometry, inflammation/malnutrition laboratory data and body composition 
      (phase angle calculated using bioelectrical impedance analysis) were collected. 
      RESULTS: Eighty-one subjects (age 81.5 ± 11.5 years) were enrolled. Mean energy 
      intake was 669.0 ± 573.9 kcal/day, and mean protein intake was 30.7 ± 25.8 g/day. 
      Over 60% of patients ingested ≤50% of their calculated energy and protein 
      requirements: these patients were older (p = 0.026), had a lower middle-upper arm 
      circumference (p = 0.022) and total arm area (p = 0.038), a higher C-reactive 
      protein/albumin ratio and Instant Nutritional Assessment score (p < 0.01), and 
      experienced longer hospital stays (p ≤ 0.04) and higher in-hospital and 30-day 
      post-discharge mortality (p < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, lower 
      middle-upper arm circumference, higher C-reactive protein/albumin ratio, and 
      impaired self-feeding at admission were independently associated with critically 
      reduced energy and protein intake. CONCLUSIONS: Middle-upper arm circumference, 
      C-reactive protein/albumin ratio, and impaired self-feeding are easily obtainable 
      indicators of impaired energy and protein intake and poor clinical outcomes. Such 
      parameters should be adopted as screening criteria to assess the risk for 
      critically reduced energy/protein intake in hospitalized older adults. These 
      findings are relevant to improve clinical practice through the implementation of 
      multidisciplinary strategies, given the adverse clinical outcomes related to 
      hospital malnutrition.

TI  - Apathy, not depressive symptoms, as a predictor of semantic and phonemic fluency 
      task performance in stroke and transient ischemic attack.
PG  - 449-461
LID - 10.1080/13803395.2017.1371282 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the relationship between apathy and cognition in 
      patients with cerebrovascular disease. Apathy may result from damage to frontal 
      subcortical circuits causing dysexecutive syndromes, but apathy is also related 
      to depression. We assessed the ability of apathy to predict phonemic fluency and 
      semantic fluency performance after controlling for depressive symptoms in 282 
      individuals with stroke and/or transient ischemic attack. METHOD: Participants 
      (N = 282) completed the Phonemic Fluency Test, Semantic Fluency Test, Center for 
      Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and Apathy Evaluation Scale. A 
      cross-sectional correlational design was utilized. RESULTS: Using hierarchical 
      linear regressions, apathy scores significantly predicted semantic fluency 
      performance (β = -.159, p = .020), but not phonemic fluency performance 
      (β = -.112, p = .129) after scaling scores by age and years of education and 
      controlling for depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms entered into the first 
      step of both hierarchical linear regressions did not predict semantic fluency 
      (β = -.035, p = .554) or phonemic fluency (β = -.081, p = .173). Apathy and 
      depressive symptoms were moderately correlated, r(280) = .58, p < .001. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are consistent with research supporting a 
      differentiation between phonemic and semantic fluency tasks, whereby phonemic 
      fluency tasks primarily involve frontal regions, and semantic fluency tasks 
      involve recruitment of more extended networks. The results also highlight a 
      distinction between apathy and depressive symptoms and suggest that apathy may be 
      a more reliable predictor of cognitive deficits than measures of mood in 
      individuals with cerebrovascular disease. Apathy may also be more related to 
      cognition due to overlapping motivational and cognitive frontal subcortical 
      circuitry. Future research should explore whether treatments for apathy could be 
      a novel target for improving cognitive outcomes after stroke.

TI  - Clinical and Psychosocial Factors Influencing Retinal Screening Uptake Among 
      Young Adults with Type 2 Diabetes.
PG  - 41
LID - 10.1007/s11892-018-1007-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Young adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D, 18-39 years) 
      experience early-onset and rapid progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR), the 
      leading cause of vision loss for working age adults. Despite this, uptake of 
      retinal screening, the crucial first step in preventing vision loss from DR, is 
      low. The aim of this review is to summarize the clinical and psychosocial factors 
      affecting uptake of retinal screening. RECENT FINDINGS: Barriers include lack of

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common symptom in the general population and has a 
      substantial effect on individuals' quality of life. The Multidimensional Fatigue 
      Inventory (MFI) has been widely used to quantify the impact of fatigue, but no 
      Traditional Chinese translation has yet been validated. The goal of this study 
      was to translate the MFI from English into Traditional Chinese ('the MFI-TC') and 
      subsequently to examine its validity and reliability. METHODS: The study 
      recruited a convenience sample of 123 people from various age groups in Taiwan. 
      The MFI was examined using a two-step process: (1) translation and 
      back-translation of the instrument; and (2) examination of construct validity, 
      convergent validity, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and 
      measurement error. The validity and reliability of the MFI-TC were assessed by 
      factor analysis, Spearman rho correlation coefficient, Cronbach's alpha 
      coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), minimal detectable change 
      (MDC), and Bland-Altman analysis. All participants completed the Short-Form-36 
      Health Survey Taiwan Form (SF-36-T) and the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh 
      Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) concurrently to test the convergent validity of the 
      MFI-TC. Test-retest reliability was assessed by readministration of the MFI-TC 
      after a 1-week interval. RESULTS: Factor analysis confirmed the four dimensions 
      of fatigue: general/physical fatigue, reduced activity, reduced motivation, and 
      mental fatigue. A four-factor model was extracted, combining general fatigue and 
      physical fatigue as one factor. The results demonstrated moderate convergent 
      validity when correlating fatigue (MFI-TC) with quality of life (SF-36-T) and 
      sleep disturbances (PSQI) (Spearman's rho = 0.68 and 0.47, respectively). 
      Cronbach's alpha for the MFI-TC total scale and subscales ranged from 0.73 
      (mental fatigue subscale) to 0.92 (MFI-TC total scale). ICCs ranged from 0.85 
      (reduced motivation) to 0.94 (MFI-TC total scale), and the MDC ranged from 2.33 
      points (mental fatigue) to 9.5 points (MFI-TC total scale). The Bland-Altman 
      analyses showed no significant systematic bias between the repeated assessments. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results support the use of the Traditional Chinese version of 
      the MFI as a comprehensive instrument for measuring specific aspects of fatigue. 
      Clinicians and researchers should consider interpreting general fatigue and 
      physical fatigue as one subscale when measuring fatigue in Traditional 
      Chinese-speaking populations.

TI  - Patterns and predictors of exhaustion episodes in patients with stable COPD: A 
      longitudinal study.
PG  - e13068
LID - 10.1111/ijcp.13068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Exhaustion is the perception of low energy. Little is 
      known about how exhaustion persists, remits or reappears over time in patients 
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or how to predict these events. 
      We determined the likelihood of transitions between states of exhaustion and no 
      exhaustion among patients with stable COPD followed up for 2 years. We 
      investigated combinations of potential factors for their abilities to predict 
      new-onset exhaustion episodes. METHODS: We prospectively included 137 patients 
      with stable COPD (mean age, 66.9 years ± 8.3). Exhaustion states were measured at 
      baseline and 1 and 2 years later. Exhaustion was defined as an answer of "most of 
      the time" or "a moderate amount of time" to 1 of 2 questions: "How often have you 
      found it hard to get going?" and "How often does everything seem to require 
      effort?" We evaluated demographic, non-respiratory and respiratory variables as 
      potential predictors. The likelihoods of new episodes and recovery were 
      calculated. Predictors were evaluated with generalised estimating equations. 
      RESULTS: At baseline, 27 patients (19.7%) displayed exhaustion. Of the 110 
      patients without exhaustion at baseline, 17 (15.5%) displayed exhaustion at least 
      once during the follow-up period. During the study period, a total of 204 annual 
      transitions displaying no exhaustion at the beginning were identified. Of them, 
      10.3% transitioned to exhaustion in the next year. The likelihood of recovery 
      after exhaustion was 50%. Independent predictors of new-onset exhaustion episodes 
      within the following year were: the COPD assessment test score (odds ratio 
      [OR] = 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.21), depression (OR = 6.89; 95% 
      CI: 1.00-47.41) and female gender (OR = 6.88; 95% CI: 1.83-25.73). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Patients in stable COPD with high CAT scores and depression were most likely to 
      experience new-onset exhaustion episodes Thus, exhaustion might be predicted by a 
      combination of psychological factors and respiratory health status. Nevertheless, 
      exhaustion is dynamic in COPD; half of patients recover from exhaustion.

LID - 10.1016/j.jamda.2017.11.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Frailty and disability are associated with 
      cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, in older people; however, 
      little is known about their association with ambulatory blood pressure (BP). 
      Thus, we assessed the relationship of frailty and disability with ambulatory BP 
      in older adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of 1047 
      community-living individuals aged ≥60 years in Spain. MEASUREMENTS: BP was 
      determined with validated devices under standardized conditions during 24 hours. 
      Frailty was defined as having 3 or more of the following criteria: weight loss, 
      low grip strength, low energy, slow gait speed, and low physical activity. 
      Disability was assessed with the Lawton-Brodýs questionnaire on instrumental 
      activities of daily living. Associations with systolic BP (SBP) and dipping 
      (nocturnal SBP decline) were modeled and adjusted for sociodemographic variables, 
      body mass index, lifestyles, antihypertensive drug treatment, comorbidities, 
      24-hour heart rate, and conventional or ambulatory SBP as appropriate. RESULTS: 
      Participants' mean age was 71.7 years (50.8% men); 6% were frail and 8.1% had 
      disability. Compared with nonfrail participants, those with frailty had 3.5 mm Hg 
      lower daytime SBP (P = .001), 3.3% less SBP dipping (P = .003), and 3.6 mmHg 
      higher nighttime SBP (P = .016). Compared with participants who are not disabled, 
      those who are disabled had 2.5 mmHg lower daytime SBP (P = .002), 2.5% less SBP 
      dipping (P = .003), and 2.7 mmHg higher nighttime SBP (P = .011). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      community-dwelling older adults, frailty and disability were independently 
      associated with lower diurnal SBP, blunted nocturnal decline of SBP, and higher 
      nocturnal SBP. These findings may help explain the higher mortality associated 
      with low clinic SBP in frail older subjects observed in epidemiologic studies.

      diabetes-related symptoms in adults with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 469

LID - 469
AB  - BACKGROUND: Using self-determination theory, the objective of this study was to 
      examine, over a one-month period, how physical activity (PA) motivation would 
      influence accelerometer-derived PA behavior, and ultimately, acute 
      diabetes-related symptoms burden among adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D adults). 
      Using both a person and variable-centered approach, this objective was attained 
      by means of: 1) investigating the indirect effect of PA participation on the 
      relationship between PA motivation and acute diabetes-related symptom burden and 
      2) examining whether participants who met PA recommendations (i.e., 150 min of 
      moderate-to-vigorous PA per week) would experience less acute diabetes-related 
      symptom burden over a one-month period. METHODS: A two-wave prospective 
      longitudinal design was used. At time 1, participants completed a questionnaire 
      assessing their PA motivation and were asked to wear an ActiGraph GT3x 
      accelerometer for four consecutive weeks. At time 2, they completed a short 
      questionnaire assessing their acute diabetes-related symptoms (i.e., symptoms 
      related to fatigue, cognitive distress, hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia). The 
      final sample includes 165 adults (89 or 53.61% women) aged from 26 to 75 years (M 
      = 62.05, SD = 8.75) with T2D, which provided at least 21 valid days of 
      accelerometer-derived data. RESULTS: First, results of a path analysis 
      demonstrated that over a one-month period, the average number of minutes spent 
      practicing moderate to vigorous PA per week mediated the relationship between 
      intrinsic and external PA motivation and the level of burden associated with the 
      following diabetes-related symptoms: fatigue, cognitive distress, and 
      hyperglycemia. In addition, results of covariance analyses showed that 
      participants meeting PA recommendations also reported significantly less burden 
      associated with these three symptoms over a month period. Then, the existence of 
      four motivational profiles (Self-Determined, High Introjected, Low Motivation, 
      and Non-Self-Determined) was confirmed using a k-means analysis. Results of 
      covariance and chi-square analyses further showed, respectively, that compared to 
      other motivational profiles, the Self-Determined profile was associated with a 
      higher score on weekly PA participation and meeting PA recommendations. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of promoting autonomous motives 
      for PA participation among T2D adults. They also suggest that T2D adults meeting 
      PA recommendations experience less acute diabetes-related symptoms burden, which 
      further support the importance of their PA motivation.

TI  - Participation in bowel screening among men attending abdominal aortic aneurysm 
      screening.
PG  - 529-534
LID - 10.1002/bjs.10758 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uptake of population-based screening for colorectal cancer in 
      Scotland is around 55 per cent. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening has 
      recently been introduced for men aged 65 years and the reported uptake is 
      78 per cent. The aim was to determine the impact of a brief intervention on bowel 
      screening in men who attended AAA screening, but previously failed to complete 
      bowel screening. METHODS: Men invited for AAA screening between September 2015 
      and March 2016 within NHS Tayside were included. Attendees who had not responded 
      to their latest bowel screening invitation were seen by a colorectal cancer 
      clinical nurse specialist. Reasons for not completing the faecal occult blood 
      test (FOBT) were recorded; brief information on colorectal cancer screening was 
      communicated, and participants were offered a further invitation to complete a 
      FOBT. Those who responded positively were sent a further FOBT from the Scottish 
      Bowel Screening Centre. Subsequent return of a completed FOBT within 6 months was 
      recorded. RESULTS: A total of 556 men were invited for AAA screening, of whom 
      38·1 per cent had not completed a recent FOBT. The primary reason stated for not 
      participating was the time taken to complete the test or forgetting it 
      (35·1 per cent). Other reasons included: lack of motivation (23·4 per cent), 
      confusion regarding the aim of screening (16·2 per cent), disgust 
      (19·8 per cent), fear (6·3 per cent) and other health problems (9·9 per cent). 
      Following discussion, 81·1 per cent agreed to complete the FOBT and 49 per cent 
      subsequently returned the test. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of previous 
      bowel screening non-responders subsequently returned a completed FOBT following a 
      brief intervention with a nurse specialist. Attendance at non-bowel screening 
      appointments may provide a valuable opportunity to improve bowel screening 
      uptake.

TI  - Real-Time Observation of Apathy in Long-Term Care Residents With Dementia: 
      Reliability of the Person-Environment Apathy Rating Scale.
PG  - 23-28
LID - 10.3928/00989134-20180131-02 [doi]
AB  - Apathy is prevalent in individuals with dementia. Lack of responsiveness to 
      environmental stimulation is a key characteristic of apathy. The 
      Person-Environment Apathy Rating (PEAR) scale consists of environment and apathy 
      subscales, which allow for examination of environmental impact on apathy. The 
      interrater reliability of the PEAR scale was examined via real-time observation. 
      The current study included 45 observations of 15 long-term care residents with 
      dementia. Each participant was observed at three time points for 10 minutes each. 
      Two raters observed the participant and surrounding environment and independently 
      rated the participant's apathy and environmental stimulation using the PEAR 
      scale. Weighted Kappa was 0.5 to 0.82 for the PEAR-Environment subscale and 0.5 
      to 0.8 for the PEAR-Apathy subscale. Overall, with the exception of three items 
      with relatively weak reliability (0.50 to 0.56), the PEAR scale showed moderate 
      to strong interrater reliability (0.63 to 0.82). The results support the use of 
      the PEAR scale to measure environmental stimulation and apathy via real-time 
      observation in long-term care residents with dementia. [Journal of Gerontological 
      Nursing, 44(4), 23-28.].

TI  - Assessment of Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS): the dimension of anhedonia 
      in Italian healthy sample.
PG  - 657-661
LID - 10.1007/s10072-018-3260-2 [doi]
AB  - The Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) is a rapid screening battery created 
      for assessing the presence of anhedonia, namely the inability to experience 
      pleasure. Although, this symptom has widely been investigated in clinical 
      settings, individual differences in anhedonia are also present in healthy 
      population. The aim of present study was to validate the translated Italian 
      version of this test. One thousand six hundred ninety-seven consecutive healthy 
      subjects (55% female) of different ages (age 18-82 years) underwent SHAPS. 
      Participants who showed mild level of anhedonia also completed the Apathy 
      Evaluation Scale (AES), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Toronto Alexithymia 
      Scale-20 (TAS), Mood Disorders Insight Scale (MDIS), and Beck Hopelessness Scale 
      (BHS). The SHAPS showed good internal consistency and discriminant validity; 
      moreover, the factorial analysis highlighted that SHAPS had a three-factor 
      structure for explaining the anhedonic construct. 14.9% showed a significant 
      reduction of hedonic tone (SHAPS ≥ 3). Finally, the degree of anhedonia was 
      significantly correlated with BDI and BHS scores, but not with age or gender. 
      Although anhedonia is a prominent feature of many psychiatric and neurological 
      disorders, the presence of this symptom in the healthy population highlighted the 
      importance to develop reliable tool. SHAPS shows good psychometric properties to 
      assess multidimensional anhedonia symptoms also in Italian healthy population.

TI  - The Prevalence and Correlates of Frailty in Urban and Rural Populations in Latin

AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been few cross-national studies of the prevalence of the 
      frailty phenotype conducted among low or middle income countries. We aimed to 
      study the variation in prevalence and correlates of frailty in rural and urban 
      sites in Latin America, India, and China. METHODS: Cross-sectional 
      population-based catchment area surveys conducted in 8 urban and 4 rural 
      catchment areas in 8 countries; Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, 
      Peru, Mexico, China, and India. We assessed weight loss, exhaustion, slow walking 
      speed, and low energy consumption, but not hand grip strength. Therefore, frailty 
      phenotype was defined on 2 or more of 4 of the usual 5 criteria. RESULTS: We 
      surveyed 17,031 adults aged 65 years and over. Overall frailty prevalence was 
      15.2% (95% confidence inteval 14.6%-15.7%). Prevalence was low in rural (5.4%) 
      and urban China (9.1%) and varied between 12.6% and 21.5% in other sites. A 
      similar pattern of variation was apparent after direct standardization for age 
      and sex. Cross-site variation in prevalence of frailty indicators varied across 
      the 4 indicators. Controlling for age, sex, and education, frailty was positively 
      associated with older age, female sex, lower socioeconomic status, physical 
      impairments, stroke, depression, dementia, disability and dependence, and high 
      healthcare costs. DISCUSSION: There was substantial variation in the prevalence 
      of frailty and its indicators across sites in Latin America, India, and China. 
      Culture and other contextual factors may impact significantly on the assessment 
      of frailty using questionnaire and physical performance-based measures, and 
      achieving cross-cultural measurement invariance remains a challenge. CONCLUSIONS: 
      A consistent pattern of correlates was identified, suggesting that in all sites, 
      the frailty screen could identify older adults with multiple physical, mental, 
      and cognitive morbidities, disability and needs for care, compounded by 
      socioeconomic disadvantage and catastrophic healthcare spending.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Relationships between depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD) may 
      become clearer if studied in preclinical AD where dementia is not present. 
      METHOD: The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively, relationships 
      between brain amyloid-β (Aβ), depressive symptoms and screen positive depression 
      in cognitively normal (CN) older adults. Depressive symptoms were measured with 
      the Geriatric Depression Inventory (GDS-15) in CN adults from the Australian 
      Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study without depression at baseline and 
      classified as having abnormally high (Aβ+; n = 136) or low (Aβ-; n = 449) Aβ 
      according to positron emission tomography at 18-month intervals over 72 months. 
      RESULTS: Incident cases of screen positive depression were not increased in Aβ+ 
      CN adults although small increases in overall depressive symptoms severity (d = - 
      0.25; 95% CI, - 0.45, - 0.05) and apathy-anxiety symptoms (d = - 0.28; 95% CI - 
      0.48, - 0.08) were. LIMITATIONS: As the AIBL sample is an experimental sample, no 
      individuals had severe medical illnesses or significant psychiatric disorders. 
      Additionally, individuals who had evidence of screen-positive depression at 
      screening were excluded from enrolment in the AIBL study. Thus, the current data 
      can be considered only as providing a foundation for understanding relationships 
      between Aβ and depression in preclinical AD. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest 
      that the presence of a depressive disorder or even increased depressive symptoms 
      are themselves unlikely to be a direct consequence of increasing Aβ. New 
      depressive disorders presenting in CN older adults could therefore be 
      investigated for aetiologies beyond AD.

TI  - Association of energy and protein intakes with length of stay, readmission and 
      mortality in hospitalised patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
PG  - 543-551

AB  - Low energy and protein intakes have been associated with an increased risk of 
      malnutrition in outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We 
      aimed to assess the energy and protein intakes of hospitalised COPD patients 
      according to nutritional risk status and requirements, and the relative 
      contribution from meals, snacks, drinks and oral nutritional supplements (ONS), 
      and to examine whether either energy or protein intake predicts outcomes. 
      Subjects were COPD patients (n 99) admitted to Landspitali University Hospital in 
      1 year (March 2015-March 2016). Patients were screened for nutritional risk using 
      a validated screening tool, and energy and protein intake for 3 d, 1-5 d after 
      admission to the hospital, was estimated using a validated plate diagram sheet. 
      The percentage of patients reaching energy and protein intake ≥75 % of 
      requirements was on average 59 and 37 %, respectively. Malnourished patients 
      consumed less at mealtimes and more from ONS than lower-risk patients, resulting 
      in no difference in total energy and protein intakes between groups. No clear 
      associations between energy or protein intake and outcomes were found, although 
      the association between energy intake, as percentage of requirement, and 
      mortality at 12 months of follow-up was of borderline significance (OR 0·12; 95 % 
      CI 0·01, 1·15; P=0·066). Energy and protein intakes during hospitalisation in the 
      study population failed to meet requirements. Further studies are needed on how 
      to increase energy and protein intakes during hospitalisation and after discharge 
      and to assess whether higher intake in relation to requirement of hospitalised 
      COPD patients results in better outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the increasing number of dementia patients in China, there is a 
      pressing need for a reliable and valid Chinese instrument that can measure 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms in institutionalized dementia patients. This study 
      examined the reliability and structural validity of the Chinese version of the 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Nursing Home version (NPI-NH), in a sample of 
      institutionalized dementia patients in China. METHODS: A total of 112 residents 
      with dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating = 1: 10.7%; Clinical Dementia Rating = 2: 
      39.3%; Clinical Dementia Rating = 3: 50.0%) and 30 informants participated in 
      this cross-sectional study. Reliability was tested using Cronbach's α and 
      intra-class correlation coefficient. Principal component analysis was used to 
      evaluate the factor structure of the inventory. RESULTS: Of the patients, 92.9% 
      had at least one neuropsychiatric symptom. Apathy (57%) was the most common 
      symptom. The Chinese version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Nursing Home 
      version, showed acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's α for the total 
      scale, frequency, severity, and disturbance subscales were 0.64, 0.70, 0.73, and 
      0.80, respectively) and test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation 
      coefficient for the total scale, frequency, severity, and disturbance subscales 
      were 0.93, 0.92, 0.89, and 0.91, respectively). Five factors-psychomotor 
      behaviour, affective symptoms, psychosis, sleep disorders, and eating 
      disorders-were identified for the total scale. The cluster symptoms aggression 
      and irritability, depression and anxiety, and delusions and hallucinations were 
      three of the optimally stable groups of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      demonstrated that the Chinese version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Nursing 
      Home version, is a valid and reliable instrument for evaluating neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms in institutionalized dementia patients.

LID - 10.1007/s00198-017-4317-4 [doi]
AB  - This study used data from the International Costs and Utilities Related to 
      Osteoporotic fractures Study (ICUROS) to estimate the quality of life (QoL) 
      impact of fracture. Hip, vertebral, and distal forearm fractures incur 
      substantial QoL losses. Hip and vertebral fracture results in markedly impaired 
      QoL for at least 18 months. INTRODUCTION: The International Costs and Utilities 
      Related to Osteoporotic fractures Study (ICUROS) is a multinational observational 
      study that aims to describe costs and quality of life (QoL) consequences of 
      osteoporotic fractures. To date, 11 countries have participated in the study: 
      Australia, Austria, Estonia, France, Italy, Lithuania, Mexico, Russia, Spain, the 
      UK, and the USA. The objective of this paper is to describe the QoL impact of 
      hip, vertebral, and distal forearm fracture. METHODS: Data were collected at four 
      time-points for five QoL point estimates: within 2 weeks after fracture 
      (including pre-fracture recall) and at 4, 12, and 18 months after fracture. 
      Quality of life was measured as health state utility values (HSUVs) derived from 
      the EQ-5D-3L. Complete case analysis was conducted as the base case with 
      available case and multiple imputation performed as sensitivity analyses. 
      Multivariate analysis was performed to explore predictors of QoL impact of 
      fracture. RESULTS: Among 5456 patients enrolled using convenience sampling, 3021 
      patients were eligible for the base case analysis (1415 hip, 1047 distal forearm, 
      and 559 vertebral fractures). The mean (SD) difference between HSUV before and 
      after fracture for hip, vertebral, and distal forearm fracture was estimated at 
      0.89 (0.40), 0.67 (0.45), and 0.48 (0.34), respectively (p < 0.001 for all 
      fracture types). Eighteen months after fracture, mean HSUVs were lower than 
      before the fracture in patients with hip fracture (0.66 vs. 0.77 p < 0.001) and 
      vertebral fracture (0.70 vs. 0.83 p < 0.001). Hospitalization and higher recalled 
      pre-fracture QoL were associated with increased QoL impact for all fracture 
      types. CONCLUSIONS: Hip, vertebral, and distal forearm fractures incur 
      substantial loss in QoL and for patients with hip or vertebral fracture, QoL is 
      markedly impaired for at least 18 months.

TI  - Beck Depression Inventory-II: Factor Analyses with Three Groups of Midlife Women 
      of African Descent in the Midwest, the South, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

AB  - This research encompasses a factor analysis of the Beck Depression Inventory-II 
      (BDI-II), which involves three groups of midlife women of African descent who 
      reside in the Midwest, the South, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The purpose of the 
      study was to determine the factor structure of the BDI-II when administered to a 
      sample of women aged 40-65 of African descent who reside in the three distinct 
      geographical regions of the United States. A correlational, descriptive design 
      was used, and 536 women of African descent were invited to participate in 
      face-to-face interviews that transpired in community settings. Results of the 
      factor analysis revealed a two-factor explanation. Factor one included symptoms 
      such as punishment feelings and pessimism (cognitive), and the second factor 
      included symptoms such as tiredness and loss of energy (somatic-affective). The 
      application of the Beck Depression Inventory-II among the three groups of women 
      generated specific information about each group and common findings across the 
      groups. Knowledge gained from the research could help to guide specific 
      intervention programs for the three groups of women, and explicate the common 
      approaches that could be used for the three groups.

TI  - Apathy in rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder is common and 
      under-recognized.
PG  - 469-e32
LID - 10.1111/ene.13515 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Apathy is an important neuropsychiatric feature of 
      Parkinson's disease (PD), which often emerges before the onset of motor symptoms. 
      Patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) have a high 
      probability of developing PD in future. Neuropsychiatric problems are common in 
      RBD, but apathy has not previously been detailed in this key prodromal 
      population. METHODS: Eighty-eight patients with polysomnographically proven RBD, 
      65 patients with PD and 33 controls were assessed for apathy using the Lille 
      Apathy Rating Scale. Cognition and depression were also quantified. The 
      sensitivity of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale screening questions 
      for apathy and depression was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 46% of patients 
      with RBD were apathetic, compared with 31% of patients with PD in our sample. 
      Most patients with RBD with depression were apathetic but more than half of 
      apathetic patients were not depressed. The sensitivity of the single Unified 
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale screening question was only 33% for mild apathy 
      and 50% for severe apathy. CONCLUSIONS: Apathy is common in RBD and is 
      underestimated by a single self-report question. Recognition of apathy as a 
      distinct neuropsychiatric feature in RBD could aid targeted treatment 
      interventions and might contribute to the understanding of prodromal PD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate (1) the concurrent validity of the Nursing Home 
      Life-Space Diameter (NHLSD) and the Home-based Life-Space Assessment (Hb-LSA), 
      (2) the correlated factors of life-space, and (3) the factors that affected the 
      NHLSD score for the elderly in a geriatric health service facility, or Roken. 
      METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 32 participants in a Roken. Staff 
      members, who had received essential guidance for assessment, examined the 
      cognitive function, physical function, mood, communication ability, objective 
      quality of life, vitality, and daily behavior of the participants. Correlation 
      analysis between NHLSD and other measurements and multiple regression analysis 
      with NHLSD as a dependent variable were conducted. RESULTS: NHLSD and Hb-LSA were 
      significantly correlated (r=0.710, P<0.01). NHLSD was significantly correlated 
      with more measurements than Hb-LSA was; i.e., NHLSD was significantly correlated 
      with communication ability, independence of daily living (Barthel Index; BI), 
      maximum knee extension strength, grip strength, function in daily living, and 
      three QOL measurements: positive affects, ability to communicate, and spontaneity 
      and activity. A stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that the BI total 
      score, the maximum knee extension strength, and spontaneity and activity (one of 
      the QOL items) were significantly correlated with the NHLSD score. CONCLUSIONS: 
      NHLSD can measure the mobility levels of elderly persons in Roken. In addition to 
      physical conditions and dependence of ADLs, spontaneity (or low levels of apathy) 
      may be an important factor for promoting physical activity in Roken.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To validate a newly developed multiple symptom self-assessment tool 
      in nursing homes. DESIGN: Thirty prevalent symptoms identified in the literature 
      were classified by a 2-round Delphi procedure to a top 10 of the most relevant, 
      burdensome symptoms. Because no existing symptom scale fully covered this top 10, 
      we developed a new scale, consisting of a horizontal numerical scale for the top 
      10 symptoms, with the possibility to add and rate 3 other symptoms. This scale 
      was validated. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Hundred seventy-four participants, mean 
      age 85 (±5.94) years, were recruited from 7 nursing homes (86%) and 3 acute 
      geriatric wards (14%). METHODS: To test the construct validity, participants with 
      and without a palliative status were enrolled. Participants completed the Symptom 
      Assessment to Improve Symptom Control for Institutionalized Elderly (SATISFIE) 
      scale on day 0 and day 1 (intrarater reliability). Nurses completed the scale on 
      day 0 (inter-rater reliability). Descriptive statistics described the 
      characteristics of the study population and symptom scores. Differences in 
      symptom scores between palliative and nonpalliative participants were analyzed 
      with the Mann-Whitney U test. Intrarater and inter-rater reliability were 
      calculated by means of an intraclass correlation coefficient. Factor analysis 
      searched for possible symptom clusters. Feasibility was evaluated by measuring 
      the assessment time and by providing a questionnaire for the nurses. RESULTS: In 
      the nonpalliative group (n = 130), the highest self-rated median scores were pain 
      on day 1 [median 3, interquartile range (IQR) 0-5] and pain on day 2. In the 
      palliative group (n = 44), the highest median self-rated scores were fatigue on 
      day 1 [median 5 (IQR 0-6)], lack of energy on day 1 and 2 [both median 5 (IQR 
      0-8)]; and depressed feeling on day 2 [median 3 (IQR 0-5)]. Nurse assessments 
      median scores were the highest for depressed feeling [median 5 (IQR 1-7)], 
      fatigue [median 4.5 (IQR 0-6.5)], and lack of energy, [median 3 (IQR 0-6)] in the 
      palliative group. In the nonpalliative group, none of the median scores was 3 or 
      more. Intraclass correlation coefficients for intrarater reliability varied 
      between 0.65 and 0.89 and for inter-rater reliability (patients-nurses) between 
      0.18 and 0.63. Mean assessment time for nurses was 2.0 minutes [standard 
      deviation (SD) = 1.01]. For participants, it decreased from 10.5 minutes 
      (SD = 5.41) at the first assessment to 7.5 minutes (SD = 3.72) at the second 
      assessment. Nurses determined the SATISFIE instrument to be useful, applicable in 
      daily practice, and sufficiently comprehensible for the patients. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The SATISFIE scale is a valid and feasible instrument for regular, multiple 
      symptom assessment in institutionalized older persons.

TI  - Social Dysfunction in Older Age and Relationships with Cognition, Depression, and 
      Apathy: The GreatAGE Study.
PG  - 989-1000
LID - 10.3233/JAD-180466 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies focused on only one measure of social dysfunction in 
      older age, without proper validation and distinction across different dimensions 
      including subjectivity, structural, and functional aspects. OBJECTIVE: We sought 
      to validate the Social Dysfunction Rating Scale (SDRS) and its factorial 
      structure, also determining the association of SDRS with cognitive functions, 
      global psychopathology, and social deprivation. METHODS: The SDRS was 
      administered to 484 Italian community-dwelling elderly, recruited in the GreatAGE 
      study, a population-based study on aging conducted in Castellana Grotte, Bari, 
      Southern Italy. We determined objective and subjective psychometric properties of 
      SDRS against the gold standard evaluation of social dysfunction according to the 
      Semi-structured Clinical Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders 
      (SCID-I) criterion. RESULTS: The SDRS showed a moderate accuracy with an optimal 
      cut-off of 26 maximized with higher sensitivity (0.74,95% CI:0.63-0.84) than 
      specificity (0.57,95% CI:0.50-0.64). A five-factor structure was carried out and 
      five dimensions of SDRS were identified (loneliness; social isolation; feeling of 
      contribution/uselessness; lack of leisure activities; anxiety for the health). 
      Education and global cognitive functions were inversely correlated to SDRS, while 
      a direct association with global psychopathology, depression, and apathy was 
      found. The prevalence of higher SDRS scores was major in subjects with current 
      psychiatric disorders versus other subjects.∥Conclusion: The SDRS could be a 
      valid instrument to capture both size and quality of social dysfunction, both in 
      subjects with psychiatric disorders and in normal subjects. Several categories of 
      social dysfunction differed only in the degree of health deprivation, not in 
      social or material deprivation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of the defining characteristics of the 
      nursing diagnosis for "fatigue in women with breast cancer under radiotherapy". 
      METHOD: Study of diagnostic accuracy, with cross-sectional design, performed in 
      130 women with breast cancer under radiation treatment. A data collection 
      instrument was used to evaluate clinical socio-demographics and to investigate 
      the presence or absence of defining characteristics for fatigue. The latent class 
      analysis model was applied to assess accuracy measurements of the characteristics 
      identified. RESULTS: Fatigue diagnosis was present in 21.9% of the women. The 
      characteristic which showed the highest sensitivity was "Impaired capacity in 
      maintaining the usual level of physical activity", while "Impaired capacity in 
      maintaining usual routines" and "Lack of interest about the surrounding 
      environment" presented greater specificity. CONCLUSION: Accurate diagnostics 
      allow devising an action plan directed to the patients' real needs.

TI  - The Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia in Down Syndrome (BPSD-DS) 
      Scale: Comprehensive Assessment of Psychopathology in Down Syndrome.
PG  - 797-819
LID - 10.3233/JAD-170920 [doi]
AB  - People with Down syndrome (DS) are prone to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are core features, but 
      have not been comprehensively evaluated in DS. In a European multidisciplinary 
      study, the novel Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia in Down 
      Syndrome (BPSD-DS) scale was developed to identify frequency and severity of 
      behavioral changes taking account of life-long characteristic behavior. 83 
      behavioral items in 12 clinically defined sections were evaluated. The central 
      aim was to identify items that change in relation to the dementia status, and 
      thus may differentiate between diagnostic groups. Structured interviews were 
      conducted with informants of persons with DS without dementia (DS, n = 149), with 
      questionable dementia (DS+Q, n = 65), and with diagnosed dementia (DS+AD, 
      n = 67). First exploratory data suggest promising interrater, test-retest, and 
      internal consistency reliability measures. Concerning item relevance, group 
      comparisons revealed pronounced increases in frequency and severity in items of 
      anxiety, sleep disturbances, agitation & stereotypical behavior, aggression, 
      apathy, depressive symptoms, and eating/drinking behavior. The proportion of 
      individuals presenting an increase was highest in DS+AD, intermediate in DS+Q, 
      and lowest in DS. Interestingly, among DS+Q individuals, a substantial proportion 
      already presented increased anxiety, sleep disturbances, apathy, and depressive 
      symptoms, suggesting that these changes occur early in the course of AD. Future 
      efforts should optimize the scale based on current results and clinical 
      experiences, and further study applicability, reliability, and validity. Future 
      application of the scale in daily care may aid caregivers to understand changes, 
      and contribute to timely interventions and adaptation of caregiving.

TI  - Apathy in Parkinson's disease: differences between caregiver's report and 
      self-evaluation.
PG  - 31-35
AB  - Apathy is a state of diminished goal-directed speech, motor activity and 
      emotions. The prevalence of apathy in Parkinson's disease (PD) ranges from 16 to 
      62%. Several studies have investigated the relationships between apathy and other 
      dimensions of PD, but little is known about possible discrepancies between 
      self-evaluation (SE) and caregiver reporting (CR) of this symptom. The aim of 
      this study is twofold: 1) to investigate the differences in apathy evaluations 
      according to the point of view from which apathy is reported (SE vs CR); 2) to 
      identify the possible relationships between each of the two evaluations (SE and 
      CR) and cognitive and affective dimensions of PD. Forty-eight patients with PD 
      were assessed using the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) in its SE and CR versions 
      (AES-SE and AES-CR); cognitive, affective and behavioral symptoms were also 
      assessed. AES-SE scores were significantly higher than AESCR ones. Neither AES 
      version correlated with depression, whereas both correlated with motor 
      impairment, disease stage and behavioral symptoms. Mini-Mental State Examination 
      and Frontal Assessment Battery scores showed significant negative correlations 
      only with AES-SE scores. Our findings suggest that the point of view from which 
      apathy is seen can lead to significant discrepancies, even when using the same 
      tool. This should be taken into account in order to obtain correct assessment of 
      this disabling and distressing symptom.

TI  - The Progression of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease During a 
      Five-Year Follow-Up: Kuopio ALSOVA Study.
PG  - 1367-1376
LID - 10.3233/JAD-170697 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An improved understanding of the role of neuropsychiatric symptoms 
      (NPS) in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently emerged. NPS lead to 
      hospitalization and caregiver stress, but are more variable during the course of 
      the disease than other symptoms. Knowledge about the role of specific NPS in 
      disease progression and prognosis is especially limited. OBJECTIVES: To examine 
      the relationship between specific NPS and AD severity during a 5-year follow-up 
      period, and to determine which baseline NPS predict AD progression. METHODS: 236 
      persons with very mild (CDR 0.5) or mild (CDR 1) AD at baseline and their 
      caregivers were followed up for five years as part of the ALSOVA study. The 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory was used to assess NPS, and AD severity progression 
      was measured with the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes. Data was analyzed 
      with Generalized Estimated Equations and Linear Mixed Models. RESULTS: The 
      baseline NPS that best predicted AD progression were delusions, agitation, and 
      aberrant motor behavior, while AD severity during follow-up was associated with 
      hallucinations, delusions, agitation, apathy, aberrant motor behavior, and sleep 
      and appetite disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Persons with mild AD presenting 
      delusions, agitation, and aberrant motor behavior at the time of diagnosis could 
      have a more rapidly progressing disease, and some NPS are associated with AD 
      severity. These results highlight the importance of evaluating NPS at the time of 
      AD diagnosis, and the need to offer additional support to persons presenting 
      delusions, agitation and aberrant motor behavior, and their caregivers.

PG  - 25-31
LID - 10.1080/00207454.2017.1347170 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), but 
      little is known about apathy and white matter (WM) change. In this study, we 
      investigated whether fractional anisotropy (FA) of the WM can distinguish 
      apathetic patients from non-apathetic PD patients, and whether the FA value 
      correlates with the severity of apathy in PD. METHODS: Thirty-nine PD patients 
      participated in our study, of which 18 participants were with apathy symptom, and 
      21 without apathy symptom. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed on all the 
      subjects. RESULTS: Compared to non-apathetic PD patients, the apathetic group had 
      reduced FA values in the genu and body of corpus callosum, bilateral anterior 
      corona radiata, left superior corona radiata and left cingulum. Furthermore, in 
      these WM regions, the FA values were negatively correlated with the Lille Apathy 
      Rating Scale scores in apathetic subjects. CONCLUSION: The WM change is 
      associated with apathy in PD patients. In addition, the FA values of specific 
      regions of WM could be a promising marker to predict the severity of apathy.

TI  - Apathy dimensions in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 151-158
LID - 10.1002/gps.4697 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Apathy is a prominent and disabling symptom in Parkinson's disease 
      (PD) and is a multidimensional behaviour, but which dimensions are specifically 
      affected is unclear. Therefore, the aim of this preliminary study was to 
      determine the psychometric properties of the Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) and 
      explore the multidimensional profile of apathy in PD patients. METHODS: 
      Thirty-four PD patients, with 30 of their informants/carers, and 34 healthy 
      controls, with 30 of their informants, completed the DAS, Apathy Evaluation Scale 
      and the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form. Motor staging and independent 
      living status were recorded. RESULTS: Comparative group analyses revealed that PD 
      patients were significantly more apathetic on self-rated executive (p = 0.01) and 
      initiation (p = 0.03) dimensions than controls, where only executive apathy was 
      significantly higher in ratings of patients' informants/carers compared with 
      controls' informants (p = 0.02). A third of patients were impaired on at least 
      one apathy dimension. Additionally, patients with apathy tended to have more 
      impaired activities of daily living, while none of the apathy dimensions related 
      to motor disability. CONCLUSION: Our findings show the DAS is a valid and 
      reliable multidimensional apathy tool for use in PD. PD is characterised by an 
      executive apathy profile as determined by informants/carers, although patients 
      described both executive and initiation apathy. This indicates a lack of 
      motivation for planning, organisation and attention and lack of initiation of 
      thoughts or behaviours. Further research is needed to determine the cognitive 
      underpinnings of this emerging apathy profile and the clinical impact in PD.

TI  - Psychometric properties of the apathy evaluation scale in patients with 
      Parkinson's disease.
LID - 10.1002/mpr.1564 [doi]
LID - e1564
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) frequently entails non-motor symptoms, worsening the 
      course of the disease. Apathy is one of the core neuropsychiatric symptoms that 
      has been investigated in recent years; research is however hampered by the 
      limited availability of well-evaluated apathy scales for these patients. We 
      evaluated the psychometric properties of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) in a 
      sample of PD patients. Psychometric properties, convergent and discriminant 
      validity and sensitivity/specificity were evaluated in patients with (n = 582) or 
      without dementia/depression (n = 339). Internal consistency was high in the 
      entire sample as well as in patients without dementia/depression. Correlations 
      were moderate for convergent validity (UPDRS I item 4: motivation). While apathy 
      could be differentiated from cognitive decline, it was related to depression 
      (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS-15). The overall classification accuracy based 
      on the UPDRS I item 4 was comparable for AES and GDS scores. The AES exhibits 
      good psychometric properties in PD patients with and without dementia and/or 
      depression. Commonly used screenings on the presence of apathy had low detection 
      rates compared to the AES and reflected both apathetic and depressive symptoms. 
      Psychometric evaluation of available instruments will support further research on 
      the clinical relevance of apathy for disease progression and treatment approaches 
      in PD patients.

AB  - The diagnosis of dementia and the management of its associated symptoms are aided 
      by high-quality assessment tools. However, there is disagreement on the optimal 
      tools among abundant alternatives and lack of consistent quality standards across 
      the different domains of dementia-related change (ie, cognition, severity, 
      function, behavioral and psychological symptoms, delirium, quality of life). 
      Standardization is difficult because the relevance of a measurement tool for 
      health professionals may depend on the clinical setting and on the dementia type 
      and severity. To address this need, we conducted a comprehensive and clinically 
      relevant evidence-based review of dementia-related tools and present a set of 
      recommended tools, the Dementia Outcomes Measurement Suite. The review revealed 
      that considerable development has occurred in terms of assessment of persons with 
      mild cognitive impairment, executive dysfunction, cognitively mediated functional 
      change, and apathy. More research is needed to develop and validate tools to 
      assess health-related quality of life and specific symptoms of dementia including 
      anxiety, wandering, and repetitive vocalizations. This extensive overview of the 
      quality of different measures may serve as a guide for health professionals 
      clinically and for researchers developing new or improved dementia assessment 
      tools.

AB  - Apathy and cognitive dysfunction are prominent symptoms of Amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS). More specifically ALS patients show increased Initiation 
      apathy-a lack of motivation for self-generation of thoughts as assessed by the 
      Dimensional Apathy Scale. This study aimed to investigate the cognitive 
      underpinnings of apathy subtypes in ALS. We hypothesized that increased 
      Initiation apathy would be associated deficits on tests of intrinsic response 
      generation, such as verbal fluency. We also explored the relationship of other 
      apathy subtypes to cognitive processes, in particular emotional apathy with 
      emotional and social cognition deficits and executive apathy with planning and 
      goal management deficits. ALS patients, and their carers (N = 30), and healthy 
      matched controls, and their informants (N = 29) were recruited. All participants 
      completed self- and informant/carer-rated Dimensional Apathy Scale, to quantify 
      apathy subtypes (Executive, Emotional and Initiation), along with standard apathy 
      and depression measures. Patients and controls completed the Edinburgh Cognitive 
      and behavioural ALS Screen, and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery 
      including emotional recognition, social cognition, intrinsic response generation 
      tasks (verbal fluency and random number generation) and a new ecologically valid, 
      computerised measure of planning and goal management. The results demonstrated 
      that increased Initiation apathy was the only significantly elevated subtype in 
      ALS (self-rated p < .05, informant/carer-rated p < .01). Initiation apathy was 
      found to be significantly associated with verbal fluency deficit, while Emotional 
      apathy was significantly associated with emotional recognition deficits. No 
      associations were found between apathy subtypes and depression or in controls. 
      This is the first study to show specific associations between apathy subtypes 
      (Emotional and Initiation) and executive and emotional cognitive dysfunction, 
      indicating possible distinct underlying mechanisms to these demotivational 
      symptoms.

TI  - Assessment of apathy minimising the effect of motor dysfunctions in Parkinson's 
      disease: a validation study of the dimensional apathy scale.
PG  - 2533-2540
LID - 10.1007/s11136-017-1569-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Apathy is associated with motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD); 
      therefore, its evaluation could be influenced by motor disability. The 
      Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) evaluates apathy excluding confounding effects of 
      motor symptoms. The present study had three major aims: (a) to explore the 
      psychometric properties of the DAS in non-demented PD patients; (b) to determine 
      an optimal cut-off score of the DAS to identify apathetic PD patients; and (c) to 
      determine a specific apathy profile in PD patients as compared to healthy 
      controls (HC). METHODS: One hundred and seven PD patients and 100 HC completed 
      the DAS. To explore convergent and divergent validity of the DAS in PD, patients 
      underwent the Apathy Evaluation Scale and tools for assessing depressive 
      symptoms, anxiety and cognition. Clinical aspects were recorded. Receiver 
      operating characteristic curve analyses were carried out to estimate the optimal 
      cut-off score to identify clinically significant apathy. RESULTS: The DAS scores 
      showed high internal consistency and good evidence for convergent and 
      discriminant validity. Maximum discrimination between apathetic and non-apathetic 
      patients was obtained with a cut-off score of 28.5 (total score range: 0-72 with 
      higher score indicating more severe apathy). Comparison between PD and HC groups 
      revealed significant differences on total DAS, behavioural/cognitive initiation 
      and emotional subscales. CONCLUSIONS: The DAS is a valid and reliable tool to 
      assess multidimensional apathy in PD, independently of severity of motor 
      symptoms. Reduced initiation of thought and behaviour and emotional blunting 
      characterised PD patients, without confounding effects of motor disability.

TI  - Personality, dopamine, and Parkinson's disease: Insights from subthalamic 
      stimulation.
PG  - 1191-1200
LID - 10.1002/mds.27065 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subthalamic stimulation improves the motor and neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, the impact of this treatment on impulse 
      control and personality is the subject of heavy debate. The objective of this 
      study was to investigate personality changes after subthalamic stimulation. 
      METHODS: Using Cloninger's biosocial model, we assessed personality in 73 
      Parkinson's disease patients before and 12 months after subthalamic stimulation 
      accompanied by a drastic reduction in dopaminergic medication. Changes in 
      psychobehavioral symptoms were measured using a battery of validated clinical 
      scales (apathy, depression, anxiety, hyperemotionality, mania, psychosis, 
      punding, and impulse control behaviors). RESULTS: One year after surgery, the 
      harm avoidance personality domain total score increased compared with the 
      baseline (+2.8; 34 patients; P < 0.001), as did 3 of its 4 subdomains: 
      anticipatory worry (+0.7; 10 patients; P = 0.005), shyness (+0.6; 7 patients; 
      P = 0.03), and fatigability (+1.1; 10 patients; P = 0.0014). Evolution of the 
      shyness personality trait correlated with the decrease in dopaminergic 
      medication. Total scores in the other personality domains remained unchanged, 
      except for extravagance, a subdomain of novelty seeking, and persistence, a 
      subdomain of reward dependence, which both decreased following surgery (-0.3; 7 
      patients; and -0.6; 9 patients; P = 0.03 and P = 0.0019, respectively). Although 
      apathy increased, other psychobehavioral symptoms, including impulse control 
      behaviors and neuropsychiatric nonmotor fluctuations, improved. Depression and 
      anhedonia remained stable. Scores in hypodopaminergia and neuropsychiatric 
      nonmotor OFF correlated with harm avoidance. Scores in hyperdopaminergia and 
      neuropsychiatric nonmotor ON correlated with novelty seeking. CONCLUSIONS: When 
      subthalamic stimulation is applied in Parkinson's disease, significant changes in 
      personality traits are observed, which may be related to postoperative tapering 
      of dopaminergic treatment. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder

PG  - 477-484
LID - 10.1080/08039488.2017.1334820 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy, a prevalent and clinically relevant symptom in 
      neurodegenerative disease, is often evaluated by the instrument Apathy Evaluation 
      Scale (AES). However, this instrument has not been translated into Swedish, 
      halting clinical and research efforts. Furthermore, previous studies lack 
      analyses of some basic properties, such as the legitimacy of a total score, or 
      have analysed dimensionality by questionable methods. AIM: To translate and 
      psychometrically evaluate a Swedish version of the AES. METHOD: The AES was 
      translated, and its psychometric properties were tested in the Swedish BioFINDER 
      study, including cognitively well elderly, and subjects with mild cognitive or 
      parkinsonian symptoms. Psychometric analyses were conducted according to 
      classical test theory (CTT) and aimed to resemble those performed in the English 
      original study by Marin et al. in 1991. Dimensionality was additionally analysed 
      on a matrix of polychoric correlations and parallel analyses. RESULTS: Data 
      indicate that the Swedish AES performs satisfactorily regarding data 
      completeness, scaling assumptions, targeting, and reliability. Principal 
      component analyses (with parallel analysis) of polychoric correlation matrices 
      identified a single component. Convergent and discriminative validity 
      correlations accorded with a priori expectations. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides 
      initial support that this Swedish AES performs similarly to the English original, 
      and exhibits acceptable psychometric properties according to CTT, including 
      supported unidimensionality, and may be adopted for use in clinical and research 
      settings.

PG  - 434-442

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Apathy is associated with cognitive decline and worse survival in 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); an accurate evaluation of this aspect is 
      relevant in clinical settings. The aims of this study are to evaluate the 
      prevalence of apathy in a large ALS sample, using published diagnostic criteria, 
      and to explore the psychometric properties, the sensitivity and the specificity 
      of the Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) as a screening tool for apathy. METHODS: 
      One hundred and thirty-one patients underwent clinical interview based on 
      diagnostic criteria for apathy, DAS, Apathy Evaluation Scale, and assessment of 
      depression, global cognitive functioning, and non-verbal intelligence. RESULTS: 
      According to diagnostic criteria, apathy occurred in 28.2% of the patients. The 
      DAS showed high consistency, convergent, and discriminant validities. Apathetic 
      and non-apathetic patients significantly differed on total DAS and executive and 
      Behavioral/Cognitive Initiation subscales, indicating good criterion validity. 
      Receiver operating characteristics analysis, considering diagnostic criteria for 
      apathy as gold standard, revealed that a score of 26/27 was an optimal cut-off 
      score for the identification of apathy. CONCLUSIONS: The DAS is a valid screening 
      tool for apathy and its aspects in ALS through limiting the impact of physical 
      disability. Executive and behavioral/cognitive aspects of apathy, rather than 
      emotional aspects, are more frequent in ALS.

TI  - Development of a caregiver-reported measure to support systematic assessment of 
      people with dementia in long-term care: The Integrated Palliative care Outcome 
      Scale for Dementia.
PG  - 651-660
LID - 10.1177/0269216316675096 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptom burden is common for long-term care residents with dementia 
      which if untreated compromises quality of life. Measurement tools can support 
      assessment of symptoms and problems but are not widely used in long-term care 
      settings. We developed the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale for Dementia 
      derived from the Palliative care Outcome Scale, Palliative care Outcome 
      Scale-Symptom and Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale. AIM: To examine the 
      content validity, acceptability and comprehension of Integrated Palliative care 
      Outcome Scale for Dementia for routine use in long-term care settings for people 
      with dementia and to refine Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale for 
      Dementia. DESIGN: A multi-method qualitative study consisting of focus groups, 
      semi-structured interviews and cognitive interviews. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Three 
      residential long-term care settings in London, UK. Focus group and 
      semi-structured interview participants included caregiver staff, family, general 
      practitioners and district nurses. Caregiver staff were sampled purposively for 
      cognitive interviews. RESULTS: A total of 26 respondents participated in the 
      focus groups ( n = 21) or semi-structured interviews ( n = 5) and 10 caregiver 
      staff completed cognitive interviews. Additional symptoms and problems included 
      agitation, wandering, sleep problems, communication problems and diarrhoea. 
      Refinements or lay terms were required to improve comprehension and consistency 
      of item response for nausea, drowsiness, delusions/hallucinations, agitation, 
      loss of interest, communication problems and interaction. A video presentation 
      was required to support comprehension of instructions and assessment of verbally 
      compromised residents. CONCLUSION: Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale for 
      Dementia is a comprehensive and acceptable caregiver-reported measure to detect 
      symptoms and problems in dementia. It is suitable for caregiver staff without 
      professional training as it has been refined and tailored to maximise caregiver 
      expertise, ready for further psychometric testing.

TI  - IRT Analysis of the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale: Identifying the Best Items 
      for Use with Geriatric Patients in Primary Care.
PG  - 295-306
LID - 10.1080/07317115.2016.1276115 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) (Grace & Malloy, 2001) 
      assesses behavioral dysfunction associated with frontal-subcortical damage; it is 
      often used to measure these indicators of executive dysfunction in older adults 
      with possible dementia. Although prior research supports the FrSBe's clinical 
      utility and factorial validity, little attempt has been made to examine which 
      items are most useful for geriatric cases. The goal of the present study is to 
      identify these items. METHOD: Data from 304 older patients referred for 
      neuropsychological assessment were used to examine the FrSBe's three subscales: 
      Apathy (A; 14 items), Executive Dysfunction (E; 17 items), and Disinhibition (D; 
      15 items). Item properties were investigated using the Graded Response Model, a 
      two-parameter polytomous item response theory model. RESULTS: Difficulty 
      parameters, discrimination parameters, and information curves identified 18 items 
      that effectively discriminate (a ≥ 1.70) between levels of behavioral dysfunction 
      and measure a range of dysfunction (b(A): -1.23 - 2.22; b(D): -.29 - 2.14; b(E): 
      -1.81 - 1.77). CONCLUSIONS: Most FrSBe items were effective at discriminating 
      various levels of behavioral dysfunction, though weaker items were identified. 
      CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The findings suggest the FrSBe is a useful clinical tool 
      when working with a geriatric population, though some items provide more 
      information than others.

TI  - Distinguishing subtypes of extrinsic motivation among people with mild to 
      borderline intellectual disability.
PG  - 625-636
LID - 10.1111/jir.12363 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: According to self-determination theory, motivation is ordered in 
      types, including amotivation, extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation. 
      Self-determination theory defines four subtypes of extrinsic motivation: external 
      motivation, introjected motivation, identified motivation and integrated 
      motivation. Although it has been argued theoretically that the different types of 
      motivation are universally applicable, Reid et al. () proposed a dichotomy of 
      broad subtypes of extrinsic motivation for people with intellectual disability 
      (ID) due to their cognitive limitations. The current study challenges this 
      proposal by testing whether the four subtypes of extrinsic motivation can be 
      differentiated among people with ID as well. METHOD: The subtypes of extrinsic 
      motivation were measured using two adapted versions of the Self-Regulation 
      Questionnaire, one regarding exercise and one regarding support. In total, 186 
      adults with mild to borderline ID participated in the study. RESULTS: Results 
      supported the distinction between the four subtypes of extrinsic motivation 
      regarding both exercise and support. In addition, the correlation coefficients 
      supported a quasi-simplex pattern of correlations among the subtypes, indicating 
      that adjacent subtypes were more closely related than non-adjacent subtypes. 
      Moreover, the study showed sufficient Cronbach's alphas and test-retest 
      reliabilities for early stage research. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results of the 
      current study provide initial evidence for the universality of the four subtypes 
      of extrinsic motivation across populations with and without ID.

      Gothenburg, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: Patients were included consecutively from date 
      of admission to the unit. INCLUSION CRITERIA: age 18-65 years, International 
      Classification of Diseases 10 diagnoses F20.0-F20.9 (schizophrenia) or 
      F25.0-F25.9 (schizoaffective disorder) since at least 5 years. EXCLUSION 
      CRITERIA: acute serious psychotic episodes or physical illness, alcohol or drug 
      abuse during the year before the study, diagnosed cerebral disorder at admission 
      to the unit, and insufficient ability to speak Swedish. 64 patients filled the 
      criteria and 19 accepted participation: 14 males, 5 females, median age 56 years. 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Barrow Neurological Institute Screen for Higher Cerebral 
      Functions (BNIS) scores, measured by a psychologist; Frontal Systems Behaviour 
      Scale (FrSBe) Family Version and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) V.4.0 
      scores, measured by nursing staff. Non-parametric statistics were consistently 
      applied to process the data. RESULTS: Failure analysis showed differences 
      regarding gender and subdiagnoses between participants and non-participants. All 
      participants had BNIS scores indicating cognitive dysfunction. FrSBe group 
      medians showed apathy and executive problems, indicating possible frontal lobe 
      disturbance. FIM showed dependency on others for linguistic and social 
      communication, everyday problem solving, and remembering persons and daily 
      routines. Correlations between FrSBe and FIM (p≤0.01) suggested executive 
      dysfunction being crucial to explain difficulties in performing activities of 
      daily functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Indications of considerable cognitive and 
      functional difficulties found among the participants suggestedthat the 
      instruments are clinically applicable for tentative assessment of cognitive and 
      functional ability among patients with multiepisode schizophrenia and 
      considerable care needs.

TI  - Assessing the Usefulness and Validity of Frailty Markers in Critically Ill 
      Adults.
PG  - 952-959
LID - 10.1513/AnnalsATS.201607-538OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Identifying frailty by the presence of a critical number of frailty 
      markers has been difficult to operationalize in the intensive care unit (ICU), 
      where patients often cannot complete performance measures or answer complex 
      questions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the construct and predictive validity of a 
      questionnaire-based approach to identifying frailty in adult ICU patients. 
      METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of adults admitted to a 
      medical or surgical ICU at one of two hospitals in New York. We asked patients or 
      surrogates about demographic information, frailty markers, and prehospital 
      disability status. ICU physicians completed the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), a 
      judgment-based frailty assessment tool. We examined the relationship between 
      individual frailty markers, CFS, and demographic correlates of frailty such as 
      age, prehospital living arrangement, and prehospital disability. We assessed the 
      predictive validity of possible frailty phenotypes, using hospital and 6-month 
      outcomes. RESULTS: Among 95 study participants (mean age [SD], 57.1 [17.5] yr), 
      80% reported one or more of seven frailty markers (median [interquartile range], 
      3 [1-4]). The most common frailty markers were impaired mobility (60%), impaired 
      physical activity (60%), and decreased strength (44.2%). Patients with more 
      frailty markers were older (mean age [SD] of those with at least three frailty 
      markers: 62.3 [17.7] vs. 51.6 [15.8] yr; P < 0.001) compared with those with 
      fewer than three markers, and were more likely to be judged frail by CFS (57.0 
      vs. 19.6%; P = 0.001), although of the 49 patients with three or more frailty 
      markers, CFS identified 36.7% as not frail. Malnutrition and fatigue or low 
      energy were not significantly associated with other frailty correlates. Survivors 
      with more frailty markers were more likely to die or report increased disability 
      at follow-up. In multivariate models, a frailty phenotype defined as at least 
      three of the seven frailty markers performed similarly to CFS in predicting death 
      or increased disability at 6 months (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence 
      interval], 3.3 [1.2-9.0] vs. 3.8 [1.2-11.7]) for CFS. CONCLUSIONS: Asking 
      patients or surrogates about frailty markers may be a valid approach to 
      identifying critically ill adults with a frailty phenotype associated with 
      increased risk of adverse outcomes. Larger studies measuring frailty markers may 
      provide insight into factors that impact short- and long-term outcomes after ICU 
      admission.

TI  - Symptoms of Apathy Independently Predict Incident Frailty and Disability in 
      Community-Dwelling Older Adults.

LID - 10.4088/JCP.15m10113 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although depressive symptoms are widely recognized as a predictor of 
      functional decline among older adults, little is known about the predictive 
      utility of apathy in this population. We prospectively examined apathy symptoms 
      as predictors of incident slow gait, frailty, and disability among non-demented, 
      community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: We examined 2 independent prospective 
      cohort studies-the LonGenity study (N = 625, 53% women, mean age = 75.2 years) 
      and the Central Control of Mobility in Aging (CCMA) study (N = 312, 57% women, 
      mean age = 76.4 years). Individuals were recruited from 2008 to 2014. Apathy was 
      assessed using 3 items from the Geriatric Depression Scale. Slow gait was defined 
      as 1 standard deviation or more below age- and sex-adjusted mean values, frailty 
      was defined using the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria, and disability was 
      assessed with a well-validated disability scale. RESULTS: The prevalence of 
      apathy was 20% in the LonGenity cohort and 26% in the CCMA cohort. The presence 
      of apathy at baseline, independent of depressive symptoms (besides apathy), 
      increased the risk of developing incident slow gait (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.10; 
      95% CI, 1.36-3.24; P = .001), frailty (HR = 2.86; 95% CI, 1.96-4.16; P < .001), 
      and disability (HR = 3.43; 95% CI, 1.73-6.79; P < .001) in the pooled sample. 
      These associations remained significant when accounting for demographics, medical 
      illnesses, and cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: Apathy is associated with 
      increased risk of developing slow gait, frailty, and disability, independent of 
      other established risk factors, in non-demented older adults. Apathy should be 
      screened for as a potentially preventable cause of functional decline in clinical 
      psychiatric settings.

TI  - Validity of the three apathy items of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-3A) in 
      measuring apathy in older persons.
PG  - 421-428
LID - 10.1002/gps.4484 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)-3A, a three-item subset of the 
      GDS-15, is increasingly used as a measure for apathy in research settings to 
      assess factors associating with this neuropsychiatric syndrome. We aimed to 
      assess how accurately the GDS-3A discriminates between presence and absence of 
      apathy in two populations of community-dwelling older persons, using the Apathy 
      Scale as reference standard. METHODS: Baseline data were used from 427 
      participants of the Discontinuation of Antihypertensive Treatment in Elderly 
      people (DANTE) Study Leiden and 1118 participants of the PROactive Management Of 
      Depression in the Elderly (PROMODE) Study, all ≥75 years and with available 
      GDS-3A and Apathy Scale measurements. A cut-off score of ≥14 was used for 
      presence of apathy according to the Apathy Scale. Areas under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. Based on the likelihood 
      ratios for GDS-3A scores, a cut-off of ≥2 was used for presence of apathy 
      according to the GDS-3A to calculate test characteristics. RESULTS: The AUC was 
      0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.62-0.73) in the DANTE Study and 0.72 (0.67-0.77) 
      in the PROMODE Study. In the DANTE Study sensitivity was 29.3% (21.4-38.1) and 
      specificity was 88.5% (84.4-91.8), whereas in the PROMODE Study sensitivity was 
      32.8% (24.5-41.1) and specificity 92.6% (90.9-94.2). Stratification on population 
      characteristics did not yield more favourable test characteristics. CONCLUSION: 
      The GDS-3A has low sensitivity and high specificity as a measure of apathy in two 
      populations of older persons. Using the GDS-3A in research might yield estimates 
      biassed towards the null in case of non-differential misclassification. Copyright

TI  - Cognitive Testing in Patients with CKD: The Problem of Missing Cases.
PG  - 391-398
LID - 10.2215/CJN.03670316 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cognitive testing is only valid in individuals with 
      sufficient visual and motor skills and motivation to participate. Patients on 
      dialysis usually suffer from limitations, such as impaired vision, motor 
      difficulties, and depression. Hence, it is doubtful that the true value of 
      cognitive functioning can be measured without bias. Consequently, many patients 
      are excluded from cognitive testing. We focused on reasons for exclusion and 
      analyzed characteristics of nontestable patients. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS & 
      MEASUREMENTS: Within the Choice of Renal Replacement Therapy Project (baseline 
      survey: May 2014 to May 2015), n=767 patients on peritoneal dialysis (n=240) or 
      hemodialysis (n=527) were tested with the Trail Making Test-B and the German 
      d2-Revision Test and completed the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form 
      cognition subscale. We divided the sample into patients with missing cognitive 
      testing data and patients with full cognitive testing data, analyzed reasons for 
      nonfeasibility, and compared subsamples with regard to psychosocial and physical 
      metrics. The exclusion categories were linked to patient characteristics 
      potentially associated with missing data (age, comorbidity, depression, and 
      education level) by calculation of λ-coefficient. RESULTS: The subsamples 
      consisted of n=366 (48%) patients with missing data (peritoneal dialysis =62, 
      hemodialysis =304) and n=401 patients with full cognitive testing data 
      (peritoneal dialysis =178, hemodialysis =223). Patients were excluded due to 
      visual impairment (49%), lack of motivation (31%), and motor impairment (13%). 
      The remaining 8% did not follow instructions, suffered from medical incidents, or 
      had language difficulties. Compared with patients with full cognitive testing 
      data, they were more likely to have depression; be treated with hemodialysis; be 
      older, nonworking, or more comorbid; and experience poorer shared decision 
      making. Reasons for exclusion were not related to levels of age, comorbidity 
      score, depression score, or education level. CONCLUSIONS: We excluded almost one 
      half of eligible patients from cognitive testing due to visual, motivational, or 
      motor difficulties. Our findings are consistent with exclusion categories 
      reported from the literature. We should be aware that, because of disease-related 
      limitations, conclusions about cognitive functioning in the CKD population may be 
      biased. In the future, nonvisual and nonverbal cognitive testing can be a 
      valuable resource.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) 
      has considerable influence on motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease 
      (PD). While improvements in motor functioning can be easily assessed with general 
      quality of life questionnaires, the measurement of specific STN-DBS-associated 
      impairments often remains insufficient. Hence, we aimed to develop a 
      questionnaire that measures STN-DBS-related impairments. METHODS: The development 
      of the (STN-)DBS Impairment Scale (DBS-IS) consisted of four steps. First, 30 
      semi-structured interviews before, three and twelve months after STN-DBS-surgery 
      were performed to create 76 items that relate to motor and non-motor functioning 
      in STN-DBS PD patients. Second, pilot-testing led to a rewording of the questions 
      for better understanding. Third, a first multicentre survey was performed to 
      reduce items by applying principal component analysis (PCA). Fourth, a second 
      multicentre survey was conducted to examine factor structure, reliability 
      (internal consistency) and validity. RESULTS: After the first survey (N = 215), 
      the PCA lead to a reduction of 54 items. After the second survey (N = 391), 
      exploratory factor analysis determined six factors with 22 items: 1. Postural 
      instability and gait difficulties (5 items), 2. Cognitive impairment (5 items), 
      3. Speaking problems (3 items), 4. Apathy (3 items), 5. Impulsivity (3 items), 
      and 6. Difficulties related to the DBS device (3 items). High reliability was 
      reported for all subscales (Cronbach's alpha 0.71-0.90). Similarly, construct 
      validity was high (r > 0.50, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: With this new questionnaire 
      patients can be followed-up and STN-DBS-specific problems might be adequately 
      measured. Also, comparisons between patients with and without STN-DBS might be 
      possible.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between anxiety, depression, apathy, and 
      cognitive decline in Parkinson disease (PD). DESIGN: Longitudinal study design to 
      assess whether specific neuropsychiatric, demographic, and clinical features 
      predict future cognitive decline. SETTING: Veterans Affairs San Diego Medical 
      Center and the University of California, San Diego. PARTICIPANTS: PD patients 
      (N = 68) and healthy controls (N = 30). MEASUREMENTS: Participants were 
      administered self-report measures of depression (Geriatric Depression Scale), 
      anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Scale), and apathy (Apathy Scale), and a 
      comprehensive neuropsychological battery assessing attention, language, 
      visuospatial function, verbal and visual learning and memory, and executive 
      function. Participants were tested at baseline and after an approximate 2-year 
      period. RESULTS: Anxiety and depression at baseline were the strongest predictors 
      of longitudinal decline on measures of verbal and visual learning, over and above 
      other clinical and demographic characteristics. However, baseline 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms did not significantly correlate with decline in other 
      cognitive domains. No significant correlations were detected between 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognition in the healthy control group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that anxiety and depression in PD may be risk 
      factors for subsequent declines in learning. Emerging evidence suggests nonmotor 
      symptoms are critical determinants of PD prognosis, and the results of this study 
      highlight the importance of assessment of depression and anxiety early in PD.

TI  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia may predict caregiver burden: a Sicilian 
      exploratory study.
PG  - 103-107
LID - 10.1111/psyg.12197 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia are very common. 
      They represent a main cause of burden and distress in caregivers and can lead to 
      early institutionalization of patients. We aimed to find the most specific 
      behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia that can strongly affect the 
      caregivers' burden. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients and their caregivers were 
      enrolled in this study. All of the patients were affected by Alzheimer's, 
      vascular, or frontotemporal dementia and were evaluated with the Neuropsychiatric 
      Inventory and Mini-Mental State Examination. Caregivers were administered the 
      Caregiver Burden Inventory. RESULTS: Apathy, depression, anxiety, and agitation 
      were the most common symptoms and were found in up to 90% of the patients. We 
      detected strong correlations between patient neuropsychiatric symptoms, (i.e. 
      irritability, hallucinations, aberrant motor behavioural, depression, and 
      agitation) and Caregiver Burden Inventory scores. Multiple regression analysis 
      found hallucinations, irritability, and depression to be significant predictors 
      of caregiver burden. Moreover, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory score was more 
      closely related to caregiver burden than the Mini-Mental State Examination score. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that demented patients' behavioural problems are 
      related to the level of caregiver burden and distress. Further investigations are 
      needed to differentiate the present findings among dementia subtypes and to 
      better evaluate the effect of caregivers' personal characteristics on their own 
      burden.

TI  - Assessment of apathy independent of physical disability: validation of the 
      Dimensional Apathy Scale in Italian healthy sample.
PG  - 303-309
LID - 10.1007/s10072-016-2766-8 [doi]
AB  - Apathy is well described in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by motor 
      disability; therefore, assessment of apathy avoiding possible confounding effects 
      of motor impairments is necessary in neurological diseases. Recently, the 
      Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) was developed to assess apathy as multifaceted 
      construct, independent of physical disability. We developed the Italian version 
      of the Dimensional Apathy Scale (I-DAS) and explored its psychometric properties 
      in a sample of 309 healthy individuals. Participants also completed Apathy 
      Evaluation Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II and Addenbrooke's Cognitive 
      Examination-Revised. The I-DAS showed high internal consistency, good convergent 
      and divergent validity. The I-DAS had a three-factor structure, such as the 
      original scale. The I-DAS scored was significantly correlated with individuals' 
      education, but not with age or gender. We, therefore, computed correction factor 
      for education and provided percentile distribution of the adjusted scores to 
      identify individuals with high levels of apathy. The I-DAS showed good 
      psychometric properties and can be a valid and reliable tool to assess 
      multidimensional apathy.

AB  - Apathy is a debilitating but poorly understood disorder characterized by a 
      reduction in motivation. As well as being associated with several brain 
      disorders, apathy is also prevalent in varying degrees in healthy people. Whilst 
      many tools have been developed to assess levels of apathy in clinical disorders, 
      surprisingly there are no measures of apathy suitable for healthy people. 
      Moreover, although apathy is commonly comorbid with symptoms of depression, 
      anhedonia and fatigue, how and why these symptoms are associated is unclear. Here 
      we developed the Apathy-Motivation Index (AMI), a brief self-report index of 
      apathy and motivation. Using exploratory factor analysis (in a sample of 505 
      people), and then confirmatory analysis (in a different set of 479 individuals), 
      we identified subtypes of apathy in behavioural, social and emotional domains. 
      Latent profile analyses showed four different profiles of apathy that were 
      associated with varying levels of depression, anhedonia and fatigue. The AMI is a 
      novel and reliable measure of individual differences in apathy and might provide 
      a useful means of probing different mechanisms underlying sub-clinical lack of 
      motivation in otherwise healthy individuals. Moreover, associations between 
      apathy and comorbid states may be reflective of problems in different emotional, 
      social and behavioural domains.

AB  - AIM: To study apathetic depression first diagnosed at late age and identify its 
      relation to cognitive and social dysfunction as well as to morphological and 
      functional changes in the brain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients at the 
      age above 60 years with newly diagnosed depressive episode and 15 healthy 
      age-matched volunteers were included in the study. All patients were divided into 
      two groups by the score on the Apathy scale (AS): >14 - depression with apathy 
      (n=21), <14 - depression without apathy (n=11). Patients were examined using 
      psychometric methods (HAMD, GDS, AS, SHAPS, SF-36, MoCA-test), neuroimaging (MRI 
      scanner with a magnetic field strength of 1.5 Tesla - EXCEL ART Vantage Atlas-X, 
      Toshiba, Japan) and statistical data analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Apathy 
      component in clinical depression reflects a tendency towards the increase in 
      depression severity and cognitive deterioration that results in the substantial 
      lowering of quality of life and correlates with cerebrovascular changes, decrease 
      in gray and white matter volume and mean cortical thickness of large hemispheres.

LID - 10.3233/JAD-170292 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a complex multidimensional syndrome frequently reported in 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated with impaired awareness. Here we 
      present a psychometrically robust method to profile apathy in AD. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the validity and reliability of a multidimensional apathy measure, the 
      Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS), and explore the apathy subtype profile and its 
      associations in AD. METHODS: 102 people with AD and 55 healthy controls were 
      recruited. Participants completed the DAS, the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), 
      Geriatric Depression Short form (GDS-15), and Lawton Instrumental Activities of 
      Daily Living (LIADL). Psychometric properties of the DAS were determined. 
      AD-Control comparison was performed to explore group differences on the DAS. 
      Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to explore the profile of apathy in AD. 
      RESULTS: The DAS had a good to excellent Cronbach's standardized alpha 
      (self-rated = 0.85, informant/carer-rated = 0.93) and good convergent and 
      divergent validity against standard apathy (AES) and depression (GDS-15) 
      measures. Group comparison showed people with AD were significantly higher for 
      all apathy subtypes than controls (p < 0.001), and lacking in awareness over all 
      apathy subtype deficits. LCA showed three distinct AD subgroups, with 42.2% in 
      the Executive-Initiation apathy, 28.4% in the Global apathy, and 29.4% in the 
      Minimal apathy group. CONCLUSIONS: The DAS is a psychometrically robust method of 
      assessing multidimensional apathy in AD. The apathy profiles in AD are 
      heterogeneous, with additional specific impairments relating to awareness 
      dependent on apathy subtype.

      a Community Sample.
PG  - 469-478
LID - 10.1159/000475594 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subtle age-related cognitive decline may be associated with the 
      capacity to remain engaged in mental, physical, and social activities. Informant 
      reports of cognitive decline potentially provide additional information to 
      psychometric tests on change in everyday cognitive function relevant to activity 
      engagement. OBJECTIVE: To investigate relations between decline in everyday 
      cognitive function as assessed by informant report and activity engagement in 
      community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: A sample of cognitively normal older 
      adults was drawn from the 2 latest waves of the PATH Through Life Study (n = 
      1,391; mean age 74.5 ± 1.5, 48.4% female). PATH is a 16-year longitudinal cohort 
      study set in the Canberra/Queanbeyan district, Australia. Assessments were 
      carried out at baseline, and at 3 subsequent time-points 4 years apart. At 
      wave-4, the IQCODE, an informant measure of 4-year cognitive decline was provided 
      by a spouse, family member, or friend of each participant. Activity engagement 
      was assessed by the abbreviated RIASEC Mental Activity List, self-reported 
      frequency and duration of physical activity (Whitehall Questionnaire) and the 
      Lubben Social Network Scale that assessed interaction with family/friends. 
      Participants provided demographic information, self-reported health status 
      (SF-12), and responses to the Goldberg Depression Scale. The Symbol Digit 
      Modalities Test (SDMT) and California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) were used to 
      measure objective 4-year cognitive change. Those with MMSE score of ≤27 were 
      excluded. RESULTS: IQCODE score predicted disengagement from mental activities 
      over 4 years in cognitively healthy adults (β = -0.056, standard error [SE] = 
      0.019, p = 0.004). This association was robust to covariate control and change on 
      the SDMT which was also significantly related to mental activity disengagement. 
      In models adjusted for change scores on the SDMT and the CVLT, the IQCODE was 
      associated with less physical (β = -0.692, SE = 0.24, p = 0.004) and social 
      engagement (β -0.046, SE = 0.021, p = 0.032), but relationships were attenuated 
      with the inclusion of covariates. CONCLUSION: Informant-reported cognitive 
      decline in a non-clinical sample was linked to activities that support cognitive 
      health. Associations were robust to adjustment for cognitive change scores. 
      Utilising informant reports prior to the manifestation of clinically relevant 
      decline may identify those who would benefit most from personalised activity 
      interventions.

TI  - Measuring Fatigue Using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20: A Questionable 
      Factor Structure in Haemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 121-126
LID - 10.1159/000458770 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Fatigue is recognised as a common and burdensome symptom among 
      dialysis patients. A growing body of research is devoted to understanding fatigue 
      in advanced kidney disease, yet its measurement is challenging within this 
      context. Our aim was to evaluate the factor structure underlying the 
      multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI-20) and to examine its associations with 
      clinical factors and mood. METHODS: Data was evaluated for confirmatory factor 
      analysis (CFA) from the screening phase of a multicentre randomised 
      placebo-controlled trial of sertraline in haemodialysis (HD) patients. Four 
      hundred seventy patients completed the MFI-20, which purports to measure 5 
      components of fatigue (general fatigue, mental fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced 
      motivation and reduced activity). CFA models were evaluated in MPlus 7.3 using 
      the robust maximum likelihood (MLR) estimation. RESULTS: The evaluation of the 
      original 5 factors revealed low internal reliability for the general factor and 
      reduced activity, and high intercorrelations between all sum scores. CFA revealed 
      poor model fit for the original 5-factor MFI-20 model (confirmatory fit index = 
      0.738; Tucker-Lewis index = 0.689; root mean squared error of approximation = 
      0.101). Alternative models, including 1, 3 and bi-factor models all demonstrated 
      poor fit to the data. No reliable factor model was confirmed prohibiting the 
      examination of factors associated with fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: We were not able to 
      confirm the factor structure of the MFI-20 in a large sample of HD patients. 
      Certain items may lack suitable face validity in this context.

TI  - A Multicentre Italian Validation Study in Aging Adults with Down Syndrome and 
      Other Forms of Intellectual Disabilities: Dementia Screening Questionnaire for 
      Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities.
PG  - 709-721
LID - 10.2174/1567205014666170117094757 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The USA National Task Group (NTG) guidelines advocate the use of an 
      adapted version of Dementia Screening Questionnaire for Individuals with 
      Intellectual Disabilities (DSQIID) for dementia screening of individuals with 
      Down syndrome (DS) and with other forms of ID (non-DS). OBJECTIVE: In order to 
      meet these guidelines, this study verifies the psychometric properties of an 
      Italian version of the original DSQIID in a population composed of adults aged 40 
      years and over with DS and non-DS ID. METHODS: Internal consistency, inter-rater 
      and intra-rater reliabilities, structural validity, convergent validity and known 
      group differences of DSQIID-I were assessed with 200 individuals with ID (mean of 
      55.2 years; range: 40-80 years) recruited from 15 different centers in Italy. 
      Diagnosis of dementia was done according to IASSID diagnostic criteria and its 
      degree of clinical certainty was defined according to Silverman et al.'s 
      classification (2004). RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha for the DSQIID-I was 0.94. The 
      ICCs for inter-rater and test-retest reliability were both 0.89. A Principal 
      Component analysis revealed three domains, namely memory and confusion- related 
      items, motor and functional disabilities, depression and apathy, which explained 
      almost 40% of the overall variance. The total DSQIID-I score correlated 
      significantly with DMR and differed significantly among those individuals (n = 
      34) with cognitive decline from those without (n = 166). Age, gender and severity 
      of ID were unrelated to the DSQIID-I. CONCLUSION: The present study confirms the 
      cross-cultural value of DSQIID which was proved to be a psychometrically valid 
      and user-friendly observer-rated scale for dementia screening in adults with both 
      DS and non-DS ID.

TI  - Coping in Patients With Incurable Lung and Gastrointestinal Cancers: A Validation 
      Study of the Brief COPE.

LID - 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2016.06.005 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Patients with incurable cancer engage in several coping styles to manage 
      the impact of cancer and its treatment. The Brief COPE is a widely used measure 
      intended to capture multiple and distinct types of coping. The Brief COPE has not 
      been validated among patients with incurable cancer. OBJECTIVES: We sought to 
      validate seven subscales of the Brief COPE in a large sample of patients newly 
      diagnosed with incurable lung and noncolorectal gastrointestinal cancers 
      (N = 350). METHODS: Participants completed the Brief COPE and measures assessing 
      quality of life (QOL) (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General) and 
      psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) within eight weeks 
      of diagnosis of incurable cancer. We evaluated the psychometric properties of the 
      Brief COPE using a confirmatory factor analysis and tests of correlation with the 
      QOL and distress scales. RESULTS: The Brief COPE factors were consistent with the 
      original subscales, although the Behavioral Disengagement Scale had low internal 
      consistency. Factors showed anticipated relationships with QOL and distress 
      measures, except emotional support coping, which was correlated with increased 
      depression and anxiety. We also conducted an exploratory high-order factor 
      analysis to determine if subscales' score variances grouped together. The 
      high-order factor analysis resulted in two factors, with active, emotional 
      support, positive reframing, and acceptance loading onto one factor and denial 
      and self-blame loading onto the second. CONCLUSION: The selected subscales of the 
      Brief COPE are appropriate measures of coping among individuals newly diagnosed 
      with incurable lung and gastrointestinal cancers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Coping Strategies Inventory-Short Form (CSI-SF) measures four 
      coping strategies based on 16 items: 4 items each indicating problem- vs. 
      emotion-focused engagement or disengagement. Here we provide the first assessment 
      of reliability and construct validity of the CSI-SF among hemodialysis patients 
      across 13 countries. METHODS: The CSI-SF was completed by patients in 9 languages 
      in phase 4 of the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (2009-11). 
      Cronbach's alpha was used to assess internal consistency. Exploratory and 
      confirmatory factor analyses were applied to assess the factor structure of the 
      CSI-SF by country and language. CSI-SF data were analyzed from 7201 patients (60% 
      male; median age 62.5 [range 18-96] years). RESULTS: Good internal consistency 
      (α=0.56-0.80) was seen for three scales in English (US, UK, Canada, Australia, 
      New Zealand), German, and Swedish versions. The fourth scale was internally 
      consistent if two items were dropped. In these countries, both exploratory and 
      confirmatory factor analyses indicated a factor structure consistent with the 
      four CSI-SF scales. Other language versions showed a factor structure 
      inconsistent with these four scales. CONCLUSION: The slightly modified English, 
      German, and Swedish versions of the CSI-SF are reliable and valid instruments for 
      measuring coping strategies in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - The development and validation of the Cluster Headache Quality of life scale 
      (CHQ).
PG  - 79

LID - 79
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cluster headache (CH) is a rare, excruciating and highly disabling 
      primary headache disorder. Using non cluster headache specific measures, previous 
      studies have shown that CH has a significant negative impact on patients' quality 
      of life (QoL), but a CH-specific QoL scale is currently unavailable. Thus, the 
      objective of this study was to develop and validate a CH-specific QoL scale. 
      METHODS: Based on a literature review, semi-structured patient interviews and 
      expert panel consultation, we produced a 54-item questionnaire, which was 
      pre-tested in a sample of CH patients and subsequently reduced to 47 items. The 
      revised scale was then administered to CH sufferers attending a tertiary headache 
      clinic and those registered with a patient group. A total of 406 completed 
      questionnaires were received. To assess test-retest reliability, a subsample 
      (N = 56) completed the scale on a second occasion, two weeks after the first. 
      Standard statistical methods were used to analyse the data for validity and 
      reliability. RESULTS: Item reduction and exploratory factor analysis led to 
      28-items, grouped into four subscales labelled "restriction of activities of 
      daily living", "impact on mood and interpersonal relationships", "pain and 
      anxiety", and "lack of vitality". The final CH-specific QoL scale, the CHQ, 
      demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha > 0.9) and 
      test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient > 0.8), with good 
      internal construct validity between subscales (range 0.52-0.75) and convergent 
      validity with other QoL measures. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated 
      the first patient-reported outcome measure of QoL specifically for CH sufferers, 
      which may be used to monitor QoL in clinical care and research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms of subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD) are 
      mainly associated with damage to frontal-subcortical circuits and may be similar 
      to symptoms of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). The aim of 
      this study was to determine whether the neuropsychiatric manifestations of the 
      Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-negative SVaD and bvFTD groups differ. METHODS: We 
      compared the Caregiver-Administered Neuropsychiatry Inventory (CGA-NPI) between 
      48 patients with PiB(-) SVaD and 31 patients with bvFTD. A stepwise logistic 
      regression was applied to determine the best model to predict SVaD. RESULTS: The 
      SVaD group showed a higher frequency of depression, whereas the bvFTD group had a 
      higher frequency of elation, aberrant motor behavior and appetite/eating 
      disorders. Regarding NPI subscores, the bvFTD group had greater severity of 
      elation, apathy, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior and appetite/eating 
      disorders, whereas SVaD did not have significantly higher subscores in any 
      domains. The most predictive models that tend to find suggestions of SVaD, as 
      opposed to bvFTD, are as follows: (1) the presence of depression and the absence 
      of appetite/eating disorders, (2) higher NPI subscores of depression and lower 
      NPI subscores of irritability and aberrant motor behavior. CONCLUSION: Apart from 
      apathy, SVaD differed from bvFTD in that negative symptoms were more common in 
      SVaD than bvFTD, whereas positive symptoms were predominant in bvFTD compared to 
      SVaD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Apathy is a syndrome characterized by a reduction in goal-directed 
      behavior. Neurodegenerative diseases frequently exhibit apathy. However, we lack 
      an objective measure of apathy. The Philadelphia Apathy Computerized Task (PACT) 
      measures impairments in goal-directed behavior that contribute to apathy, 
      including initiation, planning, and motivation. We sought to examine these 
      mechanisms in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. METHOD: PD patients and healthy 
      controls with a caregiver were recruited for the study. Participants were 
      administered the PACT, a novel computerized assessment of goal-directed behavior 
      based on reaction times, and the Starkstein Apathy Scale (AS). Care partners 
      completed the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Baseline demographic 
      characteristics of PD and control participants were compared using t tests and 
      Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Linear regressions were used to compare PD patients to 
      controls on each of the three PACT subtasks (initiation, planning, and 
      motivation) while controlling for motor slowing. We then compared performance on 
      each PACT subtask between PD subjects defined as apathetic using the NPI and 
      Starkstein Apathy Scale and controls. RESULTS: We included 30 PD and 15 control 
      participants in the analysis. When controlling for motor slowing, both all PD and 
      PD apathetic subjects were significantly slower than controls on the planning 
      task and on the initiation task. There were no significant differences between PD 
      patients and controls on the motivation tasks. CONCLUSIONS: PD patients showed 
      specific initiation and planning deficits compared to control participants. After 
      using traditional scales to define apathy, PD apathetic patients still exhibited 
      impaired initiation and planning behaviors. These results suggest that the PACT 
      measures aspects of impaired goal-directed behavior that may contribute to apathy 
      in PD.

AB  - The Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) has outstanding analytical potential for research 
      on immigrants' mental health and quality of life. This article examines the 
      quality of sampling, the composition and percentage of respondents in the SOEP 
      sample with an immigrant background, and the indicators available in the SOEP on 
      topics of mental health and quality of life. The concluding overview of the 
      existing literature on these topics and of the SOEP's new refugee sub-sample 
      underscores that the SOEP's potential for addressing these questions is far from 
      exhausted.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anxiety disorders are common in Parkinson's Disease (PD) and their 
      identification is relevant even at early stages. The Parkinson Anxiety Scale 
      (PAS) evaluates anxiety in PD; it was used only in the original validation study 
      in PD patients mainly at 2-3 stages of Hoehn & Yahr system (H&Y). The study aimed 
      to investigate psychometric properties of observer-rated version of the PAS 
      (OR-PAS), prevalence rate of anxiety and its features, compared with diagnostic 
      criteria in early PD patients. METHODS: A sample of 101 PD patients with H&Y:1-2 
      underwent the OR-PAS. To assess convergent and divergent validity, PD patients 
      underwent Beck Anxiety Inventory, and scales assessing depression, apathy, 
      anhedonia and cognition. To diagnose anxiety disorders, Mini International 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory was used as gold standard. A "receiver operating 
      characteristics" curve was obtained; positive and negative predictive values were 
      calculated for different cut-off points of the OR-PAS and its subscales. RESULTS: 
      There was no missing data, no floor and ceiling effects; mean score was 
      12.2±10.1; Cronbach's alpha was 0.899. The OR-PAS showed good convergent and 
      divergent validity. Maximum discrimination was obtained with a cut-off score of 
      8.5. The anxiety occurred in 59 patients (58.4%). CONCLUSION: The OR-PAS is a 
      reliable and valid screening instrument for assessing anxiety in patients at 
      early PD. Anxiety was found in 58.4% of PD patients, demonstrating that anxiety 
      occurs even at early stages.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the discriminant validity of 
      commonly used depression and anxiety screening tools in order to determine the 
      most suitable tool for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD). COPD patients (n = 56) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
      Scale (HADS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and Beck Anxiety Inventory 
      (BAI). These scores were compared to confirmed clinical diagnoses of depression 
      and anxiety using the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview. HADS depression subscale 
      (HADS-D) sensitivity/specificity was 78/81%; BDI-II 89/77%; HADS anxiety subscale 
      (HADS-A) 71/81%; and BAI 89/62%. HADS-D sensitivity/specificity was improved 
      (100/83%) with the removal of Q4 'I feel as if I am slowed down' and adjusted 
      cut-off (≥5). Removal of BDI-II Q21 'Loss of interest in sex' with adjusted 
      cut-off ≥12 resulted in similar improvement (100/79%). No problematic items were 
      identified for HADS-A or BAI. Previously reported low sensitivity/specificity of 
      the HADS for COPD patients was not replicated. Furthermore, simple modifications 
      of the HADS-D markedly improved sensitivity/specificity for depression.BDI-II, 
      HADS-A and BAI produced acceptable sensitivity/specificity unmodified. Pending 
      further research for COPD patients we recommend continued use of the HADS-A with 
      standard cut-off (≥8) and removal of Q4 of the HADS-D with lower cut-off ≥5.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop the Person-Environment Apathy Rating (PEAR) scale that 
      measures environmental stimulation and apathy in persons with dementia and to 
      evaluate its psychometrics. METHOD: The PEAR scale consists of the 
      PEAR-Environment subscale and PEAR-Apathy subscales. The items were developed via 
      literature review, field testing, expert review, and pilot testing. The construct 
      validity and reliability were examined through video observation. The parent 
      study enrolled 185 institutionalized residents with dementia. For this study, 96 
      videos were selected from 24 participants. The PEAR-Environment subscale was 
      validated using the Ambiance Scale and the Crowding Index. The PEAR-Apathy 
      subscale was validated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)-Apathy, 
      Passivity in Dementia Scale (PDS), and NPI-Depression. RESULTS: The 
      PEAR-Environment subscale and PEAR-Apathy subscales each consists of six items 
      rated on a 1-4 scale. For validity, the Crowding Index slightly, yet 
      significantly, correlated with the PEAR-Environment subscale total score and 
      three of the individual scores. Ambiance Scale scores, both engaging and 
      soothing, did not correlate with the PEAR-Environment subscale. The PEAR-Apathy 
      highly correlated with the PDS and NPI-Apathy and moderately correlated with the 
      NPI-Depression, suggesting good convergent validity and moderate discriminant 
      validity. For reliability, both environment and apathy subscales demonstrated 
      excellent internal consistency. Although facial expression and eye contact showed 
      moderate inter-rater reliability, all other items showed good to excellent 
      inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. CONCLUSION: This study has successfully 
      developed the PEAR scale and established its psychometrics based on the 
      compatible scales available. The PEAR scale is the first scale that concurrently 
      assesses apathy and environmental stimulation, and is recommended for use in 
      persons with dementia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to validate and provide a German 
      version of the Scale for Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders in Parkinson's 
      disease (SEND-PD) of Martínez-Martín et al. (2012). METHOD: The German version of 
      the SEND-PD was evaluated in a sample consisting of 96 patients with Parkinson's 
      disease (PD) (mean age: 65.3 years ± 9.6, 29 female). This scale includes 12 
      items, representing the domains psychotic symptoms, mood/apathy and impulse 
      control disorders. Reliability and validity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The 
      examined patients presented a few neuropsychiatric symptoms. Explorative factor 
      analyses identified the proposed three dimensions solution. The items of the 
      mood/apathy domain were homogenous and selective, and the domain showed 
      acceptable internal consistency. For the other two domains, the values were only 
      partially acceptable. Convergent, discriminate and construct validity were shown. 
      CONCLUSION: The German version of the SEND-PD is sufficiently reliable and valid 
      to be adopted in German speaking countries. However, since patients showed only a 
      few symptoms in the dimensions of psychotic symptoms and impulse control 
      disorders, these two domains can be evaluated only to a limited extent.

TI  - Psychometric testing of two new patient-reported outcome instruments for the 
      evaluation of treatment for hypogonadism.
PG  - 587-95
LID - 10.1111/ijcp.12828 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to perform psychometric testing and estimate 
      minimal important change (MIC) of two new patient-reported outcome (PRO) 
      instruments - Sexual Arousal, Interest and Drive Scale (SAID) and Hypogonadism 
      Energy Diary (HED). METHODS: New PRO instruments were administered immediately 
      after screening (Time 1, test-retest subset only) and immediately prior to both 
      randomisation (Time 2) and end-point (Time 3) to men participating in a 
      randomised clinical trial comparing the effect of testosterone solution 2% (TS) 
      and placebo on serum total testosterone. Psychometric analyses included 
      reliability, validity and responsiveness. Total scores for both PRO instruments 
      were transformed to a 0-100 scale. RESULTS: Study participants (n = 694) were 80% 
      age ≤ 65 years, 79% White, with mean baseline testosterone = 202 ng/dl. 
      Clinicians identified 86% subjects as having low sex drive, 86% with low energy 
      and 76% with both symptoms. Reliability analyses for SAID and HED yielded 
      reliability coefficients > 0.70. SAID scores discriminated between men having low 
      sex drive (n = 553) and those who did not (n = 80) (34.5 vs. 42.8, p < 0.001). 
      HED scores discriminated between men having low energy (n = 541) and those who 
      did not (n = 64) (48.9 vs. 60.2, p < 0.001). In the men randomised to TS (vs. 
      placebo), SAID and HED detected effect sizes of 0.61 (vs. 0.39) and 0.68 (vs. 
      0.48), respectively. MIC estimates for SAID and HED were approximately 10 and 8, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided evidence of the reliability, 
      validity and responsiveness of SAID and HED as measures of sex drive and energy, 
      respectively, making them potentially useful for evaluation of hypogonadal 
      treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Apathy is one of the most common and disabling syndromes of dementia 
      and presents at all stages of the disease. Comprehensive and structured methods 
      to assess apathy in dementia are still needed. Lille's Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) 
      has shown good psychometric properties for apathy evaluation in Parkinson disease 
      but has not been validated in dementia. The aim of this study was to validate the 
      LARS in a cohort of patients with very mild to moderate dementia. METHODS: 101 
      patients with cognitive impairment (Clinical Dementia Rating ≤ 2) and 50 healthy 
      subjects were recruited. Patient diagnoses included 43 individuals with Alzheimer 
      disease, 41 frontotemporal dementia, and 17 primary progressive aphasia. In 
      addition to LARS, the following assessments were administered: Clinical Dementia 
      Rating, Interview for Deterioration in Daily Living Activities in Dementia, 
      Functional Activities Questionnaire, Frontal Behavioral Inventory, 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS: 
      Internal consistency for LARS (Cronbach's alpha) was 0.940. Test-retest 
      intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.940 and inter-rater ICC was 0.987. 
      The correlation among LARS and NPI apathy scores (concurrent validity) was 0.834. 
      Receiver operating characteristic analysis estimated an area under the curve of 
      0.987. The optimal cutoff point was -10. Although total LARS score was influenced 
      by the presence of depression, this disorder was independent with respect to 
      apathy. CONCLUSION: LARS is reliable and valid for detecting and quantifying 
      apathy in patients with dementia, even in very early stages of the disease.

TI  - Early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in Japan and Taiwan.
PG  - 797-803
LID - 10.1111/ggi.12557 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are making a major impact on the 
      socioeconomic status of older adults in society. The recognition of early 
      symptoms and clinical presentation are crucial issues to foster early diagnosis 
      and treatment in order to have better therapeutic outcomes. METHODS: We recruited 
      clinically diagnosed AD patients at the very mild stage in the Clinical Dementia 
      Rating scale 0.5 and mild stage Clinical Dementia Rating scale 1.0 in Taiwan and 
      Japan. Psychometrics including the Ascertain Dementia 8 (AD8) questionnaire were 
      administered to collect and compare the differences of the clinical presentation 
      of the participants from the two countries. RESULTS: A total of 1189 
      participants, 641 from Taiwan and 548 from Japan, were recruited in the present 
      study. In the very mild dementia group with Clinical Dementia Rating scale 0.5, 
      apart from AD8-2: reduced interest in hobbies/activities (P = 0.056) and AD8-4: 
      trouble learning how to use a tool, appliance or gadget (P = 0.224), other AD8 
      subitems were significantly different between the two countries. Japanese 
      participants had a higher reported frequency of AD8-5: forgetting the correct 
      month or year (82.7%) than that (57.9%) in Taiwanese (P < 0.001). Taiwanese 
      participants had a higher reported frequency in AD8-1: problems with judgment 
      (20.3%), AD8-3: repeats questions, stories or statements (67.5%), AD8-6: 
      difficulty handling complicated financial affairs (32.5%); AD8-7: difficulty 
      remembering appointments (53.8%); and AD8-8: consistent problems with thinking 
      and/or memory (89.3%) than those in Japanese participants. CONCLUSION: Early 
      symptoms of AD in both countries are different. The frequently reported early 
      symptoms are important for primary physicians and the general population so that 
      they can recognize the disease in the early stage so as to have a better 
      therapeutic outcome. Such efforts would increase the awareness of dementia in the 
      general population. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 797-803.

TI  - Multidimensional apathy in ALS: validation of the Dimensional Apathy Scale.
PG  - 663-9
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2015-310772 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Apathy is a prominent symptom of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but 
      measurement is confounded by physical disability. Furthermore, it has been 
      traditionally measured as a unidimensional symptom despite research demonstrating 
      a multifaceted construct. The new Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) has been 
      specifically designed for patients with motor disability to measure 3 
      neurologically based subtypes of apathy: Executive, Emotional and Initiation. We 
      aimed to explore this behavioural symptom by examining the substructure of apathy 
      in ALS and to determine the reliability and validity of the DAS in patients and 
      their carers. METHOD: Patients and carers were recruited through the national 
      Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Register and were asked to complete the DAS, the 
      standardised Apathy Evaluation Scale, and the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short 
      Form. 83 patients with ALS, 75 carers and 83 sex-matched, age-matched and 
      education-matched controls participated. RESULTS: When compared with healthy 
      controls, patients showed a significant increase in apathy on the Initiation 
      subscale, and were significantly less apathetic on the Emotional subscale. Scores 
      on the DAS patient and carer versions did not significantly differ. Internal 
      consistency reliability, convergent and discriminant validity were found to be 
      good for the DAS subscales. There was no association between the DAS and 
      functional disability using the ALS Functional Rating Scale. CONCLUSIONS: Apathy 
      in ALS is characterised by a specific profile of increased initiation apathy and 
      reduced emotional apathy. The DAS is a reliable and valid measure for the 
      assessment of multidimensional apathy in ALS.

TI  - Base Rates of Depressive Symptoms in Patients with Coronary Heart Disease: An 
      Individual Symptom Analysis.
PG  - e0156167

LID - e0156167
AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depression is common in coronary heart disease (CHD) but 
      challenging to diagnose. Instead of focusing on the overall diagnosis of 
      depression, base rates of depressive symptoms could facilitate screening and 
      management of psychopathology in CHD. The present study investigates the 
      frequency of individual depressive symptoms in CHD and their impact on cardiac 
      and subjective health. METHODS: In total, 1337 in- and outpatients with CHD were 
      screened for depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) 
      at three different cardiac treatment sites. Tables stratified by age and gender 
      were designed to illustrate base rates of depressive symptoms. Multiple 
      regression analyses adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical data were 
      conducted to test associations between individual depressive symptoms and quality 
      of life as well impairment caused angina pectoris and dyspnea. RESULTS: During 
      the last 14 days, more than half of patients reported a loss of energy (74.9%, 
      95% Confidence Interval (CI): 70.6-79.2), sleeping problems (69.4%, 95% CI: 
      64.9-74.0), loss of interest (55.7%, 95% CI: 50.8-60.7). In contrast, psychomotor 
      change (25.6%, 95%CI: 21.3-30.0), feelings of failure (21.9%, 95%CI: 17.7-26.0), 
      suicidal ideations (14.1%, 95%CI: 10.7-17.6) were less frequently reported. 
      Depending on the outcome, only particular depressive symptoms were highly 
      associated with low quality of life and impairment caused by angina pectoris and 
      dyspnea. Loss of energy was the only depressive symptom that reliably predicted 
      all three outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms in CHD are frequent but vary 
      widely in terms of frequency. Findings underline the differential effects of 
      individual depressive symptoms on cardiac health. Presented base rates of 
      depressive symptoms offer clinicians a new way to judge the severity of 
      individual depressive symptoms and to communicate individual PHQ-9 profiles with 
      patients with respect to gender, age, cardiac symptoms and quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is defined by its motor symptoms, 
      it is now well recognised that cognitive, affective and emotion domains are also 
      impaired. The pathophysiology of these disabling non-motor symptoms (NMS) remains 
      unclear; recently the involvement of limbic areas, including the insula, in the 
      neurodegenerative process has been suggested to have a key role. These areas, and 
      the insula in particular, are also been suggested as key regions for 
      interoception; interoceptive sensitivity (IS) is a measure of the accuracy of 
      perception of sensations from inside the body related to the function of internal 
      organs. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate IS in PD patients by means of a well-established 
      task: the heartbeat perception task. Moreover, we evaluated possible correlations 
      between IS and psychological, affective and disease-related characteristics as 
      well as fatigue perception in PD patients. METHODS: Twenty PD patients and 20 
      healthy subjects (HS) were included and underwent the heartbeat perception task. 
      An extensive evaluation of motor, non-motor, affective and emotion domains was 
      carried out. RESULTS: PD patients showed lower IS than HS (0.58±0.2 vs 0.72±0.1; 
      p=0.04). PD reported higher scores in scales assessing depression (Hamilton 
      depression scale: 8.7±5.8 vs 6.2±7.5; p=0.04); anhedonia (Snaith-Hamilton 
      Pleasure Scale: 26.8±9.7 vs 15.4±2.9; p=<0.001) and apathy (Apathy Evaluation 
      Scale: 35.8±8.6 vs 27.8±6.8; p=0.008). No significant correlations were detected 
      between IS and motor, non-motor, affective and emotion symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: PD 
      patients have reduced interoceptive sensitivity. Future studies are encouraged to 
      evaluate the importance of interoception in understanding the pathophysiology of 
      affective/emotional symptoms in PD.

TI  - The SPADE Symptom Cluster in Primary Care Patients With Chronic Pain.
PG  - 388-93
LID - 10.1097/AJP.0000000000000286 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sleep disturbance, pain, anxiety, depression, and low energy/fatigue, 
      the SPADE pentad, are the most prevalent and co-occurring symptoms in the general 
      population and clinical practice. Co-occurrence of SPADE symptoms may produce 
      additive impairment and negatively affect treatment response, potentially 
      undermining patients' health and functioning. The purpose of this paper is to 
      determine: (1) prevalence and comorbidity (ie, clustering) of SPADE symptoms; (2) 
      internal reliability and construct validity of a composite SPADE symptom score 
      derived from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      (PROMIS) measures; and (3) whether improvement in somatic symptom burden 
      represented by a composite score predicted subsequent measures of functional 
      status at 3 and 12 months follow-up. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from the 
      Stepped Care to Optimize Pain care Effectiveness study, a randomized trial of a 
      collaborative care intervention for Veterans with chronic pain. RESULTS: Most 
      patients had multiple SPADE symptoms; only 9.6% of patients were monosymptomatic. 
      The composite PROMIS symptom score had good internal reliability (Cronbach's 
      alpha=0.86) and construct validity and strongly correlated with multiple measures 
      of functional status; improvement in the composite score significantly correlated 
      with higher scores for 5 of 6 functional status outcomes. The standardized error 
      of measurement (SEM) for the composite T-score was 2.84, suggesting a 3-point 
      difference in an individual's composite score may be clinically meaningful. 
      DISCUSSION: Brief PROMIS measures may be useful in evaluating SPADE symptoms and 
      overall symptom burden. Because symptom burden may predict functional status 
      outcomes, better identification and management of comorbid symptoms may be 
      warranted.

TI  - Excessive daytime sleepiness is related to subjective memory impairment in late 
      life: a cross-sectional community-based study.
PG  - 196-201
LID - 10.1111/psyg.12139 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether daytime sleepiness is related 
      to subjective memory impairment among community-dwelling elderly people, after 
      adjustment for psychosocial variables. METHODS: Questionnaires were mailed to all 
      5199 elderly residents living in one area of Tokyo. The questionnaires collected 
      information about sociodemographic variables, subjective memory impairment, and 
      excessive daytime sleepiness, which was measured by the Japanese version of the 
      Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Information was also collected on sleep hygiene, 
      health-related variables, and psychosocial variables, including perceived social 
      support, social withdrawal, and work status. RESULTS: Of the 4783 questionnaires 
      that were returned (92.0%), 4185 participants were included in the analysis 
      (valid response rate: 80.5%), after the exclusion of questionnaires with missing 
      data. The average score on the Japanese version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale 
      was 5.0 ± 3.9 for men and 4.5 ± 3.7 for women. The frequency of excessive daytime 
      sleepiness was 8.3% for men, 5.8% for women, and 7.0% in total. Stepwise 
      multivariate logistic regression revealed the odds ratio of excessive daytime 
      sleepiness as a predictor of subjective memory impairment was 6.06 (95% 
      confidence interval; 3.06-12.03). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly people who complain of 
      daytime sleepiness are potential candidates for interventions related to dementia 
      care after careful consideration of other possible causes of sleepiness.

TI  - Development of two measures of client engagement for use in home aged care.
PG  - 363-74
LID - 10.1111/hsc.12213 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the study was to develop and validate measures of client engagement in 
      aged homecare. The Homecare Measure of Engagement-Staff questionnaire (HoME-S) is 
      a self-complete measure of six dimensions of client engagement: client 
      acceptance, attention, attitude, appropriateness, engagement duration and 
      passivity. The Homecare Measure of Engagement-Client/Family report (HoME-CF) is a 
      researcher-rated interview which obtains client and/or family perspectives 
      regarding frequency and valence of conversational and recreational engagement 
      during care worker visits. Care workers (n = 84) completed the HoME-S and a 
      measure of relationship bond with client. Researchers interviewed clients (n = 
      164) and/or their family (n = 117) and completed the HoME-CF, and measures of 
      agitation, dysphoria, apathy and cognitive functioning. The HoME-S and HoME-CF 
      demonstrated good test-retest and inter-rater reliability, and showed significant 
      negative correlations with apathy, agitation and non-English-speaking background. 
      Controlling for client and care service characteristics, a stronger care 
      worker-client relationship bond and English-speaking background were 
      independently associated with higher HoME-S scores, and apathy was independently 
      associated with higher HoME-CF scores. In conclusion, the HoME-S and HoME-CF are 
      psychometrically sound engagement measures for use in homecare. Clients who are 
      apathetic or from non-English-speaking backgrounds may be less responsive to 
      traditional care worker engagement strategies. Engagement may be augmented in 
      clients who have stronger relationships with their care workers.

TI  - Validation of the Italian version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-I) in 
      institutionalized geriatric patients.
PG  - 249-55
LID - 10.4415/ANN_16_02_17 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Apathy is a very common symptom in the institutionalized elderly and 
      represents a condition of both clinical and public health importance. The Apathy 
      Evaluation Scale (AES) has been shown to be a valid and reliable tool for 
      characterizing, quantifying and differentiating apathy in various health 
      conditions. The aims of this study were to establish the validity and reliability 
      of the Italian version of the AES, and to assess the severity of apathy in a 
      sample of Italian institutionalized geriatric patients. METHOD: Data were 
      collected from clinical interviews using the AES informant version (AES-I). 
      Associations between measures of apathy and depression, cognitive functioning and 
      perceived quality of life were evaluated, as well as the effects of the living 
      environment on apathetic symptoms. RESULTS: Multiple forms of reliability and 
      validity (i.e. test-retest, internal consistency, discriminability of apathy 
      rating from a standard measure of depression) were satisfied. Our results also 
      show that the characteristics of the care setting may affect the severity of 
      apathetic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The AES-I Italian version is a reliable and 
      valid instrument for measuring apathy in Italian patients, also allowing a direct 
      comparison with data gathered in other countries.

TI  - Serum uric acid is associated with apathy in early, drug-naïve Parkinson's 
      disease.
PG  - 371-7
LID - 10.1007/s00702-015-1502-5 [doi]
AB  - Both low serum uric acid (UA) levels and apathy are considered biomarkers of 
      cognitive decline and dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD). There is an urgent 
      need to combine different biomarkers to predict disease course in PD. Data on the 
      relationship between serum UA levels and apathy in PD are lacking. The aim of 
      this study is to evaluate the relationship between serum UA levels and pure 
      apathy in early, drug-naïve PD patients. Forty-nine early, drug-naïve PD patients 
      were enrolled and stratified into two groups using the median serum UA levels at 
      diagnosis (Group 1 serum UA ≤ 4.8 mg/dl; Group 2 serum UA > 4.8 mg/dl). The 
      cohort was followed for the first 2 years of disease. Apathy was evaluated with 
      the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). Patients with lower serum UA levels presented 
      significant higher AES score compared to patients with higher serum UA levels. 
      Regression analysis showed that baseline serum UA levels were significant 
      determinants of AES scores at both baseline and 2-year follow up, irrespective of 
      gender, age, attention/executive functions and dopamine replacement therapy when 
      applicable. This is the first study showing a link between serum UA levels and 
      apathy in non-demented, non-depressed, early, drug-naïve PD, being lower serum UA 
      levels associated with greater apathy. Further follow up of our patients and 
      replication of this observation in independent cohorts are needed to establish if 
      this combination of biomarkers may help in characterizing a subgroup of PD 
      patients at diagnosis.

TI  - Depressive symptoms predict non-completion of a structured exercise intervention 
      for people with Type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 529-36
LID - 10.1111/dme.12872 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To quantify the impact of depressive symptoms on completion of 
      exercise-based rehabilitation for Type 2 diabetes management. METHODS: Depressive 
      symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression 
      scale in a prospective cohort of consecutive patients with Type 2 diabetes 
      entering a 6-month hybrid (home- and clinic-based) exercise rehabilitation 
      programme. Attendance at exercise sessions was monitored and programme 
      completion/non-completion was ascertained. RESULTS: Of the programme participants 
      (n=624, mean age 55.6±10.5 years, 47% male), 26.8% endorsed significant 
      depressive symptoms (depression score ≥16) and 68.1% completed the intervention, 
      attending 54.6±30.0% of supervised exercise sessions. Baseline depressive 
      symptoms (depression scale score ≥16) increased the risk of non-completion 
      [hazard ratio 1.49 (95% CI 1.10-2.03); P = 0.010], and predicted fewer sessions 
      attended (β=-2.1, P= 0.002) in adjusted models. A depression score threshold of 
      ≥10 (48.4% of participants) predicted non-completion [hazard ratio 1.60 (95% CI 
      1.19-2.17); P= 0.002) with optimum accuracy. Non-completions resulting from lack 
      of interest (18.9 vs. 11.0%; P= 0.026) and medical complications (14.6 vs. 6.6%; 
      P= 0.006) were more common among participants with depression scores ≥10. Greater 
      hazard ratios for depression scores ≥10 were observed in subgroups not currently 
      using insulin [hazard ratio 1.70 (95% CI 1.24-2.33); P= 0.001), or an 
      antidepressant [hazard ratio 1.83 (95% CI 1.32-2.54); P<0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Depressive symptoms were highly prevalent among participants with Type 2 diabetes 
      entering exercise-based rehabilitation, and even mild depressive symptoms posed a 
      significant barrier to completion. Depression screening may help target 
      additional supports to facilitate completion of exercise interventions for people 
      with Type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Accuracy of screening instruments for detection of neuropsychiatric syndromes in 
      Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 270-9
LID - 10.1002/mds.26522 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease includes neuropsychiatric manifestations, such as depression, 
      anxiety, apathy, psychosis, and impulse control disorders, which often are 
      unreported by patients and caregivers or undetected by doctors. Given their 
      substantial impact on patients and caregivers as well as the existence of 
      effective therapies for some of these disorders, screening for neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms is important. Instruments for screening have a particular methodology 
      for validation, and their performance is expressed in terms of accuracy compared 
      with formal diagnostic criteria. The present study reviews the attributes of the 
      screening instruments applied for detection of the aforementioned major 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease. A quasi-systematic review 
      (including predefined selection criteria, but not evaluating the quality of the 
      reviewed studies) was carried out on the basis of previous systematic reviews 
      (commissioned by the American Academy of Neurology and the Movement Disorder 
      Society) and made current by conducting a literature search (2005-2014). For 
      depression, 11 scales and questionnaires were shown to be valid for Parkinson's 
      disease screening. The recently developed Parkinson Anxiety Scale and the 
      Geriatric Anxiety Inventory demonstrate satisfactory properties as screening 
      instruments for anxiety, and the Lille Apathy Rating Scale for detection of 
      apathy. No scale adequately screens for psychosis, so a specific psychosis 
      instrument should be developed. The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive 
      Disorders in Parkinson's Disease (Questionnaire and Rating Scale) are valid for 
      comprehensive screening of impulse control disorders, and the Parkinson's 
      Disease-Sexual Addiction Screening Test for hypersexuality specifically.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is disabling in Parkinson disease. It is often associated 
      with other non-motor symptoms, but little is known about its underlying 
      pathophysiology. OBJECTIVE: To investigate neuroimaging (using dopaminergic and 
      cholinergic PET) and clinical factors associated with fatigue severity in PD. 
      METHODS: 133 PD subjects (96M/37F) completed the Fatigue Severity Scale, Movement 
      Disorders Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), 
      Hoehn-Yahr staging, validated scales for depression, anxiety, apathy, sleep, and 
      cognition, and underwent [(11)C]methyl-4-piperidinyl propionate (PMP) 
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and [(11)C]dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ) monoaminergic 
      PET imaging. We explored contributions to PD fatigue using separate regression 
      models based either on neuroimaging parameters or clinicometric scales. RESULTS: 
      In a neuroimaging regression model, neither striatal DTBZ uptake nor AChE PMP 
      uptake were predictors of fatigue in PD. In a post-hoc neuroimaging regression 
      model, stratifying the total cohort into mild vs. moderate-to-severe PD, striatal 
      DTBZ uptake was a significant predictor of fatigue in mild but not 
      moderate-to-severe PD. In a clinicometric regression model, higher Beck 
      Depression Inventory-somatic subscore, higher levodopa dose equivalents and 
      younger age were all significant predictors of fatigue in PD, but the MDS-UPDRS 
      non-motor experiences of daily living score was the best predictor overall. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Cholinergic uptake was not a predictor of fatigue in PD, but 
      nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation predicted fatigue in mild disease. Total 
      non-motor symptom burden, somatic affective symptoms, levodopa dose equivalents, 
      and younger age were independent clinical predictors of fatigue.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many studies have highlighted the high prevalence of executive 
      disorders in stroke. However, major uncertainties remain due to use of variable 
      and non-validated methods. The objectives of this study were: 1) to characterize 
      the executive disorder profile in stroke using a standardized battery, validated 
      diagnosis criteria of executive disorders and validated framework for the 
      interpretation of neuropsychological data and 2) examine the sensitivity of the 
      harmonization standards protocol proposed by the National Institute of 
      Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Canadian Stroke Network (NINDS-CSN) for the 
      diagnosis of Vascular Cognitive Impairment. METHODS: 237 patients (infarct: 57; 
      cerebral hemorrhage: 54; ruptured aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery 
      (ACoA): 80; cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT): 46) were examined by using the 
      GREFEX battery. The patients' test results were interpreted with a validated 
      framework derived from normative data from 780 controls. RESULTS: Dysexecutive 
      syndrome was observed in 88 (55.7%; 95%CI: 48-63.4) out of the 156 patients with 
      full cognitive and behavioral data: 40 (45.5%) had combined behavioral and 
      cognitive syndromes, 29 (33%) had a behavioral disorder alone and 19 (21.6%) had 
      a cognitive syndrome alone. The dysexecutive profile was characterized by 
      prominent impairments of initiation and generation in the cognitive domain and by 
      hypoactivity with disinterest and anticipation loss in the behavioral domain. 
      Cognitive impairment was more frequent (p = 0.014) in hemorrhage and behavioral 
      disorders were more frequent (p = 0.004) in infarct and hemorrhage. The 
      harmonization standards protocol underestimated (p = 0.007) executive disorders 
      in CVT or ACoA. CONCLUSIONS: This profile of executive disorders implies that the 
      assessment should include both cognitive tests and a validated inventory for 
      behavioral dysexecutive syndrome. Initial assessment may be performed with a 
      short cognitive battery, such as the harmonization standards protocol. However, 
      administration of a full cognitive battery is required in selected patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to test the psychometric properties 
      of the Polish version of the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) - its factor 
      structure, reliability, validity and standard norms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 
      study was conducted on 3 independent samples of 1804, 366 and 48 workers employed 
      in social service and general service professions. To test the OLBI structure the 
      exploratory factor analysis was conducted. The reliability was assessed by means 
      of Cronbach's α coefficient (the internal consistent) and test-retest (the 
      stability over time) method, with a 6-week follow-up. The construct validity of 
      the OLBI was tested by means of correlation analysis, using perceived stress and 
      work engagement as the criterion variables. RESULTS: The result of the factor 
      analysis confirmed a 2-factor structure of the Inventory but the construction of 
      each factor differed from that in the OLBI original version. Therefore, 2 
      separate factor analyses - each for the single component of job burnout 
      (exhaustion and disengagement from work) - were conducted. The analyses revealed 
      that each of the components consisted of 2 subscales. The reliability of the OLBI 
      was supported by 2 methods. It was also proved that job burnout and its 2 
      components, exhaustion and disengagement from work, were positively correlated 
      with perceived stress and negatively correlated with work engagement and its 3 
      components - vigor, absorption and dedication. CONCLUSIONS: Despite certain 
      limitations the Polish version of the OLBI shows satisfactory psychometric 
      properties and it can be used to measure job burnout in Polish conditions.

PG  - 837-46

AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy, one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric symptoms in 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), can be difficult to assess as cognition deteriorates. 
      There is a need for more objective assessments that do not rely on patient 
      insight, communicative capacities, or caregiver observation. OBJECTIVE: We 
      measured visual scanning behavior, using an eye-tracker, to explore attentional 
      bias in the presence of competing stimuli to assess apathy in AD patients. 
      METHODS: Mild-to-moderate AD patients (Standardized Mini-Mental Status 
      Examination, sMMSE >10) were assessed for apathy (Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
      [NPI] apathy, Apathy Evaluation Scale [AES]). Participants were presented with 16 
      slides, each containing 4 images of different emotional themes (2 neutral, 1 
      social, 1 dysphoric). The duration of time spent, and fixation frequency on 
      images were measured. RESULTS: Of the 36 AD patients (14 females, age = 78.2±7.8, 
      sMMSE = 22.4±3.5) included, 17 had significant apathy (based on NPI apathy ≥4) 
      and 19 did not. These groups had comparable age and sMMSE. Repeated-measures 
      analysis of covariance models, controlling for total NPI, showed group (apathetic 
      versus non-apathetic) by image (social versus dysphoric) interactions for 
      duration (F(1,32) = 4.31, p = 0.046) and fixation frequency (F(1,32) = 11.34, 
      p = 0.002). Apathetic patients demonstrated reduced duration and fixation 
      frequency on social images compared with non-apathetic patients. Additionally, 
      linear regression models suggest that more severe apathy predicted decreasing 
      fixation frequency on social images (R2 = 0.26, Adjusted R2 = 0.19, 
      F(3,32) = 3.65, p = 0.023). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that diminished 
      attentional bias toward social-themed stimuli is a marker of apathy in AD. 
      Measurements of visual scanning behavior may have the potential to predict and 
      monitor treatment response in apathy.

TI  - Lille Apathy Rating Scale and MDS-UPDRS for Screening Apathy in Parkinson's 
      Disease.
PG  - 257-65
LID - 10.3233/JPD-150726 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a syndrome characterized primarily by lack of motivation 
      which may be associated with cognitive, affective and behavioral changes. 
      Although the Lille Apathy Scale (LARS) has been extensively utilized in PD for 
      detecting apathy and testing the effectiveness of specific therapeutic 
      interventions, the highly variable cut-off values (between -11 and -22 points) 
      ensures the applicability of the LARS degree of difficulty as a superb screening 
      tool. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine more reliable threshold 
      values based on the neuropsychiatric status of patients. METHODS: Depression was 
      assessed utilizing the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and 
      neurocognitive status by Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination. The presence of 
      apathy was assessed by the proposed diagnostic criteria of Drijgers et al, and 
      graded by both LARS and the 'Apathy' item of MDS-UPDRS. RESULTS: Based on 
      multivariate regression analysis, we revealed the neurocognitive status, severity 
      of depression, and also gender while applying dosage of dopamine agonists to 
      determine the degree of patient apathy. Based on whether or not depression and 
      neurocognitive disorders were indeed present, we established four different 
      threshold values for the LARS: patients with normal cognition and without 
      depression: -22.5; patients with normal cognition and with depression: -18.5; 
      patients with NCD and without depression: -19.5; patients with NCD and with 
      depression: -14.5. CONCLUSIONS: The LARS and the 'Apathy' item of MDS-UPDRS were 
      confirmed to be potentially operational, beneficial and easy-to-assess 
      instruments for detecting apathy syndrome in PD. However, there is no universal 
      threshold value for the LARS suitable in all types of Parkinson's patients.

TI  - When a Little Knowledge Can Be Dangerous: False-Positive Diagnosis of Behavioral 
      Variant Frontotemporal Dementia among Community Clinicians.
PG  - 99-108
LID - 10.1159/000438454 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia 
      (bvFTD) is important as patients' behavioral symptoms have profound implications 
      for their families and communities. Since the diagnosis of bvFTD derives from 
      behavioral features, accurate identification of patients can be difficult for 
      non-specialists. Concrete rates of diagnostic accuracy among non-specialists are 
      unavailable. METHODS: To examine the accuracy of community clinicians' diagnoses 
      of bvFTD and to identify patient characteristics leading to misdiagnosis, we 
      reviewed the charts and referral letters of 3,578 patients who were seen at our 
      specialized center. Referral diagnosis and reasons, manifesting symptoms, 
      demographic data, Mini-Mental State Examination score, Clinical Dementia Rating 
      score and Neuropsychiatric Inventory score were extracted. RESULTS: 60% of 
      patients assigned a single diagnosis of bvFTD by community clinicians did not 
      have bvFTD according to specialists. Compared to specialist-confirmed bvFTD 
      patients, false bvFTD patients were more likely to be depressed and to be 
      non-Caucasian, showed less euphoria, apathy, disinhibition and abnormal eating 
      behaviors, had milder disease severity and better overall cognition. bvFTD was 
      mentioned by referring clinicians in 86% of specialist-confirmed bvFTD cases, but 
      missed cases were called Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or Huntington's disease, or 
      progressive aphasia. CONCLUSION: These results revealed a widespread lack of 
      familiarity with core diagnostic symptoms among non-specialists and suggest that 
      community clinicians require specialized diagnostic support before providing a 
      definitive diagnosis of bvFTD.

AB  - A recent confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale 
      (FrSBe) indicated that the basic structure of the FrSBe subscales held after 
      removal of 8 weak items. In a replication of previous studies using the original 
      FrSBe, the present study explored associations between a reduced version of the 
      FrSBe, cognition, and activities of daily living (ADLs) in a large mixed 
      outpatient neurologic sample. Consistent with previous findings with the original 
      FrSBe, significant associations existed between reduced FrSBe scores and the 
      Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-Second Edition. Additionally, after controlling for 
      age, gender, and education, reduced FrSBe Apathy was associated with basic ADLs, 
      and reduced FrSBe Disinhibition was associated with instrumental ADLs. These 
      results offer replication in a larger sample of previous findings and statistical 
      support for a reduced FrSBe beyond CFA results alone.

PG  - 3-10
LID - 10.1177/0891988715598232 [doi]
AB  - Brief screening tools that detect and differentiate patients with amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALSFTD) from those more subtle 
      cognitive or behavioral symptoms (ALS plus) and motor symptoms only (ALS pure) is 
      pertinent in a clinical setting. The utility of 2 validated and data-driven tests 
      (Mini-Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination [M-ACE] and Motor Neuron Disease 
      Behavioral Scale [MiND-B]) was investigated in 70 ALS patients (24 ALSFTD, 19 ALS 
      plus, and 27 ALS pure). More than 90% of patients with ALSFTD scored at or below 
      the cutoff on the M-ACE, whereas this was seen in only about 20% of ALS patients 
      without dementia. The MiND-B differentiated between ALS pure and ALS plus 
      diagnostic categories. Rasch modeling of M-ACE and MiND-B items revealed early 
      cognitive (fluency, memory recall) and behavioral (apathy) symptoms in ALSFTD. 
      The combined use of the M-ACE and MiND-B detects patients with ALSFTD, 
      differentiates along the ALS continuum, and offers insight into the progression 
      of nonmotor symptomatology in ALSFTD.

TI  - How stigma impacts on people with psychosis: The mediating effect of self-esteem 
      and hopelessness on subjective recovery and psychotic experiences.

AB  - This study aimed to examine how stigma impacts on symptomatic and subjective 
      recovery from psychosis, both concurrently and longitudinally. We also aimed to 
      investigate whether self-esteem and hopelessness mediated the observed 
      associations between stigma and outcomes. 80 service-users with psychosis 
      completed symptom (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) and subjective recovery 
      measures (Process of Recovery Questionnaire) at baseline and 6-months later, and 
      also completed the King Stigma Scale, the Self-Esteem Rating Scale and the Beck 
      Hopelessness Scale at baseline. In cross sectional regression and multiple 
      mediation analyses of the baseline data, we found that stigma predicted both 
      symptomatic and subjective recovery, and the effects of stigma on these outcomes 
      were mediated by hopelessness and self-esteem. When the follow-up data were 
      examined, stigma at baseline continued to predict recovery judgements and 
      symptoms. However, self-esteem only mediated the effect of stigma on PANSS 
      passive social withdrawal. Self-esteem and hopelessness should be considered in 
      interventions to reduce the effects of stigma. Interventions that address the 
      current and long-term effects of stigma may positively affect outcome for people 
      being treated for psychosis.

TI  - Screening Performance for Frailty Among Older Patients With Cancer: A 
      Cross-Sectional Observational Study of Two Approaches.
PG  - 1525-31
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the screening performance for frailty of the 
      Vulnerable Elders Survey-13 (VES-13) and the 2-step approach consisting of the 
      VES-13 plus the anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure) item from Patient Health 
      Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) among older patients with newly diagnosed cancer. 
      METHODS: This study involved 106 consecutive inpatients aged 65 years or older, 
      newly diagnosed with malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, just before 
      chemotherapy initiation. The participants were administered the VES-13, and also 
      underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), including for depression 
      and 6 other geriatric conditions, using validated measures, just before 
      initiation of chemotherapy. We defined frailty as the presence of 2 or more 
      geriatric conditions as determined by the CGA. Receiver operating characteristic 
      analysis was performed. The 2-step screening approach was examined by post hoc 
      analysis. RESULTS: The average age of the subjects was 74 years. Among the 106 
      subjects, 50% met the criteria for frailty. Using a cutoff score of 2 to 3 on the 
      VES-13, a sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of 72% of the screening 
      tool was obtained for the condition of frailty. When the second step of the 
      screening, consisting of the VES-13 plus anhedonia, was applied to the 
      VES-13-negative patients, the sensitivity and NPV improved to 90% and 88%, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The 2-step approach exhibited better screening 
      performance for frailty among patients with cancer than existing methods. Large 
      prospective studies are required in the future to confirm this ability of the 
      2-step approach.

TI  - Quality of Life and Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Long-Term Treated Dermatitis 
      Herpetiformis Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study in Finland.
PG  - 545-52
LID - 10.1007/s40257-015-0149-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac 
      disease. Both conditions are treated with a restrictive life-long gluten-free 
      diet (GFD). Treated celiac disease patients have been shown to have more severe 
      gastrointestinal symptoms and inferior quality of life compared with healthy 
      controls, but evidence regarding quality of life in DH is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The 
      aim was to evaluate whether long-term GFD-treated DH patients suffer from 
      persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and if they experience a drawdown in quality 
      of life. METHODS: Gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life were assessed in 
      78 long-term GFD-treated DH patients using the validated Gastrointestinal Symptom 
      Rating Scale, Psychological General Well-Being and Short Form 36 Health Survey 
      questionnaires. The findings were compared with 110 healthy controls, 
      population-based reference values and 371 treated celiac disease controls. 
      RESULTS: The median age of the DH patients at the time of the study was 57 years, 
      and 51 % were male. Significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms or 
      quality of life were not detected when treated DH patients were compared with 
      healthy controls, but treated DH patients had less severe gastrointestinal 
      symptoms and increased quality of life compared with celiac disease controls. 
      Female DH patients had more severe gastrointestinal symptoms and reduced vitality 
      compared with male DH patients. The presence of skin symptoms and the adherence 
      to or duration of GFD did not have any influence on gastrointestinal symptoms or 
      quality of life. CONCLUSION: We conclude that long-term GFD-treated DH patients 
      do not suffer from the burden of dietary treatment and have a quality of life 
      comparable to that of controls.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of non-motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease using 
      the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS).
PG  - 1673-84
LID - 10.1007/s00702-015-1437-x [doi]
AB  - Data on frequency, severity and correlations of NMS with motor complications are 
      only available for a limited number of NMS. The NMS Scale (NMSS) is a validated 
      tool to assess a broad range of NMS, which has not been used in NMS fluctuations. 
      We assessed fluctuations of a broad range of non-motor symptom (NMS) for a 
      1-month time period in fluctuating Parkinson's disease (PD) in a multicenter 
      cross-sectional study using the NMSS assessing NMS in motor On (NMSSOn) and Off 
      state (NMSSOff) combined with clinical NMS and motor function scoring in 100 
      fluctuating PD patients. ΔNMSSOn/Off was defined as the differences of NMSS 
      scores between On and Off. Complete NMSS datasets were available from 73 patients 
      (53 % men; age: 68.2 ± 9.7 years) with mean total NMSS score in On state of 41.5 
      ± 37.6 and in Off state of 75.6 ± 42.3 (P < 0.001). Scores were higher in Off 
      compared to On state for all domains except for domain "perceptual 
      problems/hallucinations" (P = 0.608). Clinimetric properties of the NMSS were 
      similar to those reported previously for NMS assessments independent of motor 
      oscillations. NMSSOn, NMSSOff and ΔNMSSOn/Off showed weak to moderate 
      correlations with demographics, indicators of motor symptom severity as well as 
      with other measures of NMS, depression and quality of life. Correlations of NMSS 
      items/domains with independent measures of related constructs were weak to 
      moderate. In conclusion, when assessed with the NMSS, a broad range of NMS 
      fluctuate with motor oscillations, but these fluctuations do neither correlate 
      with motor function nor with measures of disease progression.

TI  - Radial shock wave treatment alone is less efficient than radial shock wave 
      treatment combined with tissue-specific plantar fascia-stretching in patients 
      with chronic plantar heel pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether shock wave therapy or shock wave therapy combined with 
      plantar fascia-specific stretching is more efficient in treating chronic plantar 
      heel pain remains unclear. The aim of the study was to test the null hypothesis 
      of no difference of these two forms of management for patients who had unilateral 
      plantar fasciopathy for a minimum duration of twelve months and which had failed 
      at least three other forms of treatment. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-two 
      patients with chronic plantar fasciopathy were assigned to receive repetitive 
      low-energy radial shock-wave therapy without local anesthesia, administered 
      weekly for three weeks (Group 1, n = 73) or to receive the identical shock wave 
      treatment and to perform an eight-week plantar fascia-specific stretching program 
      (Group 2, n = 79). All patients completed the nine-item pain subscale of the 
      validated Foot Function Index and a subject-relevant outcome questionnaire. 
      Patients were evaluated at baseline, and at two, four, and twenty-four months 
      after baseline. The primary outcome measures were a mean change in the Foot 
      Function Index sum score at two months after baseline, a mean change in item 2 
      (pain during the first steps of walking in the morning) on this Index, and 
      satisfaction with treatment. RESULTS: No difference in mean age, sex, weight or 
      duration of symptoms was found between the groups at baseline. At two months 
      after baseline, the Foot Function Index sum score showed significantly greater 
      changes for the patients managed with shock-wave therapy plus plantar 
      fascia-specific stretching than those managed with shock-wave therapy alone (p < 
      0.001), as well as individually for item 2 (p < 0.001). Twenty-four patients in 
      Group 1 (32%) versus forty-seven patients in Group 2 (59%) were satisfied with 
      the treatment (p < 0.001). Significant differences persisted at four months, but 
      not at twenty-four months. CONCLUSIONS: A program of manual stretching exercises 
      specific to the plantar fascia in combination with repetitive low-energy radial 
      shock-wave therapy is more efficient than repetitive low-energy radial shock-wave 
      therapy alone for the treatment of chronic symptoms of proximal plantar 
      fasciopathy.

TI  - Caregiver report versus clinician impression: disagreements in rating 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease patients.
PG  - 1230-7
LID - 10.1002/gps.4278 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The measurement of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in dementia is 
      often based on caregiver report. Challenges associated with providing care may 
      bias the caregiver's recognition and reporting of symptoms. Given potential 
      problems associated with caregiver report, clinicians may improve measurement by 
      drawing from a wider array of available data and by applying clinical judgment. 
      OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate potential disagreements 
      between caregiver report and clinician impression when rating psychopathological 
      manifestations from the same patient with dementia. METHODS: Three hundred twelve 
      participants (156 patients with Alzheimer's disease [AD] and 156 caregivers) were 
      studied using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician Rating Scale. We 
      considered disagreement to be present when caregiver ratings were significantly 
      higher or lower (p < 0.05) than NPS ratings by clinicians of the same patient. To 
      evaluate whether disagreements were related to dementia severity, we repeated 
      comparisons across levels defined by the clinical dementia rating. RESULTS: The 
      most common disagreements involved ratings of agitation, depression, anxiety, 
      apathy, irritability, and aberrant motor behavior especially in patients with 
      mild dementia. There were fewer discrepancies in moderate or severe dementia. The 
      most consistent disagreements involved global ratings of depression where 
      caregiver scores ranged from +22.5 higher to -4.5 lower than clinician rating. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers may have incomplete perception of patient NPS mainly in 
      mild dementia. NPS ratings might be confounded by cultural beliefs, sometimes 
      leading caregiver to interpret symptoms as part of "normal" aging.

TI  - Pattern of extrapyramidal signs in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 2548-56
LID - 10.1007/s00415-015-7886-1 [doi]
AB  - Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) often develop extrapyramidal signs (EPS), 
      which increase in frequency as the disease progresses. We aimed to investigate 
      the patterns of presentation of EPS in AD and their correlation with clinical and 
      neuropathological features. 4284 subjects diagnosed with AD from the National 
      Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) database with at least one abnormal 
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) assessment were included. 
      Individuals were assigned to a discovery sample and a sensitivity analysis sample 
      (moderate and mild dementia, respectively) and a subset of subjects provided 
      neuropathological data (n = 284). Individuals from the Washington Heights and 
      Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) served as validation sample. Patterns of 
      presentation of EPS were identified employing categorical principal component 
      analysis (CATPCA). Six principal components were identified in both mild and 
      moderate AD samples: (I) hand movements, alternating movements, finger tapping, 
      leg agility ("limbs bradykinesia"); (II) posture, postural instability, arising 
      from chair, gait and body bradykinesia/hypokinesia ("axial"); (III) limb rigidity 
      ("rigidity"); (IV) postural tremor; (V) resting tremor; (VI) speech and facial 
      expression. Similar results were obtained in the WHICAP cohort. Individuals with 
      hallucinations, apathy, aberrant night behaviors and more severe dementia showed 
      higher axial and limb bradykinesia scores. "Limb bradykinesia" component was 
      associated with a neuropathological diagnosis of Lewy body disease and "axial" 
      component with reduced AD-type pathology. Patterns of EPS in AD show distinct 
      clinical and neuropathological correlates; they share a pattern of presentation 
      similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease, suggesting common pathogenic 
      mechanisms across neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Exploring preferences for domain-specific goal management in patients with 
      polyarthritis: what to do when an important goal becomes threatened?
PG  - 1895-907
LID - 10.1007/s00296-015-3336-8 [doi]
AB  - Usually priorities in goal management--intended to minimize discrepancies between 
      a given and desired situation--are studied as person characteristics, neglecting 
      possible domain-specific aspects. However, people may make different decisions in 
      different situations depending on the importance of the personal issues at stake. 
      Aim of the present study therefore was to develop arthritis-related vignettes to 
      examine domain-specific goal management and to explore patients' preferences. 
      Based on interviews and literature, situation-specific hypothetical stories were 
      developed in which the main character encounters a problem with a valued goal due 
      to arthritis. Thirty-one patients (61 % female, mean age 60 years) evaluated the 
      face validity of the newly developed vignettes. Secondly, 262 patients (60 % 
      female, mean age 63 years) were asked to come up with possible solutions for the 
      problems with attaining a goal described in a subset of the vignettes. Goal 
      management strategies within the responses and the preference for the various 
      strategies were identified. The 11 developed vignettes in three domains were 
      found to be face-valid. In 90 % of the responses, goal management strategies were 
      identified (31 % goal maintenance, 29 % goal adjustment, 21 % goal disengagement, 
      and 10 % goal re-engagement). Strategy preference was related to domains. 
      Solutions containing goal disengagement were the least preferred. Using vignettes 
      for measuring domain-specific goal management appears as valuable addition to the 
      existing questionnaires. The vignettes can be used to study how patients with 
      arthritis cope with threatened goals in specific domains from a patient's 
      perspective. Domain-specific strategy preference emphasizes the importance of a 
      situation-specific instrument.

LID - 10.1002/mds.26350 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) 
      and its association with markers of neurodegeneration in the general population 
      are poorly defined. METHODS: We assessed the prevalence of probable RBD defined 
      by two validated questionnaires, the RBD Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ) and the 
      Innsbruck RBD-Inventory (RBD-I), and studied its associations with clinical and 
      imaging markers for neurodegeneration in the Bruneck Study cohort aged 60 y or 
      older. RESULTS: Of the 456 participants without Parkinson's disease, 4.6% (RBDSQ; 
      95%CI, 3.0%-7.0%) and 7.7% (RBD-I; 95%CI, 5.6%-10.5%) had probable RBD. Probable 
      RBD diagnosed with either of the questionnaires was associated with hyposmia 
      (trend; P < 0.1), anxiety (P < 0.05), depression (P < 0.05), antidepressant use 
      (P < 0.05), and self-reported non-motor symptoms (P < 0.01), specifically, 
      dribbling saliva, memory problems, apathy, concentration problems, and anxiety. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may provide a basis for future studies intending to 
      identify cohorts at risk for Lewy body diseases through screening of the general 
      elderly population for RBD.

TI  - Comprehensive analysis of patient and caregiver predictors for caregiver burden, 
      anxiety and depression in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 2668-78
LID - 10.1111/jocn.12870 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to examine the 
      correlations between patient and caregiver characteristics with caregiver burden, 
      anxiety and depression in Alzheimer's Disease. Secondary aim was to determine 
      which behavioural and psychological symptoms had the greatest impact on caregiver 
      burden, anxiety and depression in Alzheimer's Disease. BACKGROUND: Caregivers of 
      individuals with Alzheimer's Disease experience high levels of burden, both 
      psychologically and physically. Previous studies have examined caregiver burden, 
      anxiety and depression separately. However, no paper has examined these three 
      psychological conditions simultaneously. DESIGN: A cross-sectional design. 
      METHODS: A total of 310 patients with probable Alzheimer's Disease and their 
      primary caregivers were assessed. Cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms were assessed with the Mini Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive 
      Assessment, Clock Drawing Test and Neuropsychiatric Inventory, respectively. 
      Caregiver burden, anxiety and depression were assessed with the ZBI, Generalised 
      Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. 
      RESULTS: All 12 neuropsychiatric symptoms in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory were 
      significantly correlated with caregiver burden, anxiety and depression, with the 
      top three neuropsychiatric predictors being depression, apathy and anxiety. 
      Furthermore, higher levels of caregiver anxiety were associated with a longer 
      duration of being a caregiver. Within caregivers, higher levels of depression 
      were independently associated with higher numbers of additional caregivers, lower 
      educational background and being the spouse of the patient. Higher levels of 
      burden were associated with a longer duration of being a caregiver and being the 
      spouse of the patient. Caregiver burden, anxiety or depression were not 
      significantly correlated with hours/day of caring for the patient. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Caregiver burden, anxiety and depression were significantly correlated with 
      different neuropsychiatric symptoms in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. RELEVANCE 
      TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Practitioners are able to identify caregivers at risk for 
      burden, anxiety and depression. Understanding which Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
      symptom is more closely associated with distress in caregivers will help 
      practitioners to be more specific and effective in detecting caregiver distress.

PG  - 2273-8
LID - 10.1007/s11136-015-0944-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous validation studies of the Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS) suffer 
      methodological shortcomings. The present study aimed to re-evaluate its 
      psychometric properties using exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM). 
      METHODS: A Chinese sample of 1259 community-dwelling residents completed the 
      11-item Chinese CFS and a variety of health measures (anxiety, depression, 
      exhaustion, sleep disturbance, and quality of life). In addition to traditional 
      confirmatory factor analysis, ESEM was performed to assess the fit of two- and 
      three-factor models using robust maximum likelihood estimation and oblique geomin 
      rotation. Convergent validity of the CFS was examined via associations with five 
      covariates (gender, age, exercise, perceived health, and life event) and the 
      health measures in the ESEM model. RESULTS: The ESEM models displayed a superior 
      fit to confirmatory factor models. The three-factor ESEM model showed a 
      satisfactory model fit to the data but not for the two-factor model. The three 
      factors were physical fatigue (three items, α = .800), low energy (four items, 
      α = .821), and mental fatigue (four items, α = .861). The factors exhibited 
      convergent validity with the model covariates and health measures. CONCLUSION: 
      The results demonstrate the satisfactory reliability and convergent validity for 
      the three-factor structure of the CFS as a valid measure of fatigue symptoms in 
      the general population. Future psychometric studies could adopt the ESEM approach 
      as a practical alternative to traditional confirmatory factor analysis.

TI  - Pain in Community-Dwelling Older Adults with Dementia: Results from the National 
      Health and Aging Trends Study.
PG  - 1503-11
LID - 10.1111/jgs.13536 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To report prevalence, correlates, and medication management of pain 
      in community-dwelling older adults with dementia. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. 
      SETTING: In-person interviews with self- or proxy respondents living in private 
      residences or non-nursing home residential care settings. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Nationally representative sample of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries 
      aged 65 and older enrolled in the National Health and Aging Trends Study 2011 
      wave. MEASUREMENTS: Dementia status was determined using a modified previously 
      validated algorithm. Participants were asked whether they had had bothersome and 
      activity-limiting pain over the past month. A multivariable Poisson regression 
      model was used to determine the relationship between bothersome pain and 
      sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 7,609 participants 
      with complete data on cognitive function, 802 had dementia (67.2% aged ≥80, 65.0% 
      female, 67.9% white, 49.7% proxy response, 32.0% lived alone, 18.8% lived in 
      residential care); 670 (63.5%) participants with dementia experienced bothersome 
      pain, and 347 (43.3%) had pain that limited activities. These rates were 
      significantly higher than in a propensity score-matched cohort without dementia 
      (54.5% bothersome pain, P < .001, 27.2% pain that limited activity, P < .001). 
      Proxies reported slightly higher rates of pain than self-respondents, but 
      differences were statistically significant only for activity-limiting pain (46.6% 
      proxy vs 40.1% self, P = .03). Correlates of bothersome pain included arthritis, 
      heart and lung disease, less than high school education, activity of daily living 
      disability, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and low energy. Of those reporting 
      pain, 30.3% stated that they rarely or never took any medications for pain. 
      CONCLUSION: Community-living older adults with dementia are at high risk of 
      having pain. Creative interventions and programs are needed to manage pain 
      adequately in this vulnerable population.

AB  - Identifying barriers to long-term adherence to reduced energy intake and 
      increased physical activity level is critically important for obese patients 
      seeking weight loss treatment. Previous research has identified that one such 
      barrier is low eating self-efficacy or poor confidence in one's ability to 
      control eating behavior in the presence of challenging situations. Accordingly, a 
      valid, brief measure of eating self-efficacy for longitudinal assessment of 
      weight loss and regain is needed. The purpose of this study was to test the 
      internal consistency and clinical validity of the Weight Efficacy Lifestyle 
      Questionnaire-Short Form (WEL-SF). Participants were 1740 consecutive obese 
      patients who presented for a psychological evaluation in consideration for 
      bariatric surgery. Median BMI was 44.9 (range: 35.0-111.9), age 48.7years (range: 
      18.9-77.3years), and patients were predominantly female (71.1%) and Caucasian 
      (90.8%). The median WEL-SF total score was 56 (range: 0-80) and Cronbach's alpha 
      measuring internal consistency was 0.92 with a one-factor structure. In terms of 
      clinical validation, lower WEL-SF total scores were significantly associated with 
      higher rates of binge eating episodes (P<0.0001), food addiction severity and 
      dependence (P<0.0001), night eating syndrome (P<0.0001), depression (P<0.0001), 
      and anxiety (P<0.0001). In contrast, higher WEL-SF total scores were associated 
      with higher weight management self-efficacy (P<0.0001) and motivation to make 
      positive lifestyle changes (P<0.0001). Taken together, these findings suggest 
      that the WEL-SF is a psychometrically valid clinically meaningful measure of 
      eating self-efficacy.

AB  - Cerebrovascular risk factors and white matter (WM) damage lead to worse cognitive 
      performance in Alzheimer dementia (AD). This study investigated WM microstructure 
      using diffusion tensor imaging in patients with mild to moderate AD and 
      investigated specific fiber tract involvement with respect to predefined 
      cerebrovascular risk factors and neurobehavioral data prediction 
      cross-sectionally and after 18 months. To identify the primary pathoanatomic 
      relationships of risk biomarkers to fiber tract integrity, we predefined 11 major 
      association tracts and calculated tract specific fractional anisotropy (FA) 
      values. Eighty-five patients with AD underwent neurobehavioral assessments 
      including the minimental state examination (MMSE) and 12-item neuropsychiatric 
      inventory twice with a 1.5-year interval to represent major outcome factors. In 
      the cross-sectional data, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, vitamin 
      B12, and homocysteine levels correlated variably with WM FA values. After 
      entering the biomarkers and WM FA into a regression model to predict 
      neurobehavioral outcomes, only fiber tract FA or homocysteine level predicted the 
      MMSE score, and fiber tract FA or age predicted the neuropsychiatric inventory 
      total scores and subdomains of apathy, disinhibition, and aberrant motor 
      behavior. In the follow-up neurobehavioral data, the mean global FA value 
      predicted the MMSE and aberrant motor behavior subdomain, while age predicted the 
      anxiety and elation subdomains. Cerebrovascular risk biomarkers may modify WM 
      microstructural organization, while the association with fiber integrity showed 
      greater clinical significance to the prediction of neurobehavioral outcomes both 
      cross-sectionally and longitudinally.

TI  - Citalopram, methylphenidate, or their combination in geriatric depression: a 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 561-9

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluated the potential of methylphenidate to improve 
      antidepressant response to citalopram, as assessed by clinical and cognitive 
      outcomes, in elderly depressed patients. METHOD: The authors conducted a 16-week 
      randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial for geriatric depression in 143 
      older outpatients diagnosed with major depression comparing treatment response in 
      three treatment groups: methylphenidate plus placebo (N=48), citalopram plus 
      placebo (N=48), and citalopram plus methylphenidate (N=47). The primary outcome 
      measure was change in depression severity. Remission was defined as a score of 6 
      or less on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes included 
      measures of anxiety, apathy, quality of life, and cognition. RESULTS: Daily doses 
      ranged from 20 mg to 60 mg for citalopram (mean=32 mg) and from 5 mg to 40 mg for 
      methylphenidate (mean=16 mg). All groups showed significant improvement in 
      depression severity and in cognitive performance. However, the improvement in 
      depression severity and the Clinical Global Impressions improvement score was 
      more prominent in the citalopram plus methylphenidate group compared with the 
      other two groups. Additionally, the rate of improvement in the citalopram plus 
      methylphenidate group was significantly higher than that in the citalopram plus 
      placebo group in the first 4 weeks of the trial. The groups did not differ in 
      cognitive improvement or number of side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment 
      with citalopram and methylphenidate demonstrated an enhanced clinical response 
      profile in mood and well-being, as well as a higher rate of remission, compared 
      with either drug alone. All treatments led to an improvement in cognitive 
      functioning, although augmentation with methylphenidate did not offer additional 
      benefits.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Patients with dementia experience a wide range of neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms. These symptoms often cause considerable distress to patients and 
      caregivers, and often contribute to institutionalization. The current study 
      examined the prevalence and course of neuropsychiatric symptoms in a large sample 
      of patients with dementia attending memory clinics. DESIGN: Three-year 
      nonprescriptive, observational study examining relationships between predictors 
      and outcome variables in patients with dementia. SETTING: Nine memory clinics 
      around Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Of 970 patients recruited, 779 patients had 
      dementia at baseline. MEASUREMENTS: Over 3 years, patients were rated on 6 
      occasions on the 12-item Neuropsychiatric Inventory and measures of cognition, 
      dementia severity, function, and medication use. Analyses focused on the 514 
      patients with dementia who completed the Neuropsychiatric Inventory on 4 or more 
      occasions. RESULTS: Overall levels of neuropsychiatric symptoms increased over 
      the 3 years. In particular, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, 
      apathy, disinhibition, irritability, and aberrant motor behavior increased over 
      the 3 years. Depression, euphoria, night time behavior, and appetite did not 
      significantly increase over this period. Severity of dementia, male sex, and 
      frontotemporal dementia were associated with greater levels of neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms at baseline. Dementia with Lewy bodies was associated with more 
      hallucinations and less appetite disturbances, and Alzheimer's disease was 
      associated with lower levels of neuropsychiatric symptoms than other types of 
      dementia at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirm that different symptoms 
      have different trajectories and that baseline characteristics of patients, 
      including sex and dementia type, predict the subsequent course of symptoms. The 
      findings also highlight the association between dementia severity and 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms, indicating the need to control for this variable when 
      examining their longitudinal trajectories.

TI  - International validation of a behavioral scale in Parkinson's disease without 
      dementia.
PG  - 705-13
LID - 10.1002/mds.26223 [doi]
AB  - The "Ardouin Scale of Behavior in Parkinson's Disease" is a new instrument 
      specifically designed for assessing mood and behavior with a view to quantifying 
      changes related to Parkinson's disease, to dopaminergic medication, and to 
      non-motor fluctuations. This study was aimed at analyzing the psychometric 
      attributes of this scale in patients with Parkinson's disease without dementia. 
      In addition to this scale, the following measures were applied: the Unified 
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating 
      Scale, the Lille Apathy Rating Scale, the Bech and Rafaelsen Mania Scale, the 
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the MacElroy Criteria, the Patrick Carnes 
      criteria, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Mini-International 
      Neuropsychiatric Interview. Patients (n=260) were recruited at 13 centers across 
      four countries (France, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States). Cronbach's 
      alpha coefficient for domains ranged from 0.69 to 0.78. Regarding test-retest 
      reliability, the kappa coefficient for items was higher than 0.4. For inter-rater 
      reliability, the kappa values were 0.29 to 0.81. Furthermore, most of the items 
      from the Ardouin Scale of Behavior in Parkinson's Disease correlated with the 
      corresponding items of the other scales, depressed mood with the Montgomery and 
      Asberg Depression Rating Scale (ρ=0.82); anxiety with the Hospital Anxiety and 
      Depression Scale-anxiety (ρ=0.56); apathy with the Lille Apathy Rating Scale 
      (ρ=0.60). The Ardouin Scale of Behavior in Parkinson's disease is an acceptable, 
      reproducible, valid, and precise assessment for evaluating changes in behavior in 
      patients with Parkinson's disease without dementia.

TI  - Low-grade inflammation differentiates between symptoms of apathy and depression 
      in community-dwelling older individuals.
PG  - 639-47
LID - 10.1017/S1041610214002683 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic low-grade inflammation has repeatedly been associated with 
      depression in old age, but the relationship with apathy is less clear. The 
      present study assessed whether C-reactive protein (CRP) is differentially 
      associated with symptoms of apathy and depression. METHODS: A population-based 
      cohort study was carried-out. At baseline and after two and four years of 
      follow-up, CRP levels were assessed and symptoms of apathy and depression were 
      measured using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Logistic regression 
      analysis was used to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal 
      associations of CRP with symptoms of apathy and depression. RESULTS: Two thousand 
      forty-seven community-dwelling participants (70-78 years) without a history of 
      cardiovascular disease or stroke were studied. A cross-sectional association was 
      found between CRP and apathy symptoms at three time points (odds ratio (OR) per 
      natural log unit increase in CRP: baseline visit = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.12-1.75; 
      two-year follow-up visit = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.17-2.25; four-year follow-up visit = 
      1.51, 95% CI = 1.03-2.21). This did not change after adjustment for demographics 
      and depressive symptoms, and was slightly attenuated after adjustment for 
      cardiovascular risk factors. No cross-sectional association was found with 
      depressive symptoms. Baseline CRP did not predict incident apathy or depressive 
      symptoms during four years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Increased CRP levels are 
      associated with apathy symptoms but not with depressive symptoms. This suggests a 
      differential effect of inflammation on apathy and depression. In older persons, 
      symptoms of apathy may be a behavioral manifestation of concurrent low-grade 
      inflammation.

TI  - Establishing the content validity of the Sexual Arousal, Interest, and Drive 
      Scale and the Hypogonadism Energy Diary.
PG  - 454-65
LID - 10.1111/ijcp.12542 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this qualitative analysis was to establish the content validity 
      of two new patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures: Sexual Arousal, Interest, and 
      Drive Scale (SAID) and Hypogonadism Energy Diary (HED). METHODS: Four separate 
      qualitative studies were conducted with 125 men with hypogonadism (mean age: 53 
      years, 85% adult onset). Study 1 used focus groups/interviews to identify 
      important and relevant concepts related to the experience of hypogonadism and its 
      treatment in men primarily with adult-onset hypogonadism. Study 2 tested items 
      generated for assessments of low sex drive and low energy. Study 3 used 
      interviews to confirm in men with early-onset hypogonadism that low sex drive and 
      low energy were also important and relevant symptoms. Study 4 tested final 
      versions of the two PROs and determined equivalency of paper-based and electronic 
      versions of the two PROs. RESULTS: Of the concepts emerging in Studies 1 and 3, 
      low sex drive and low energy were the symptoms most often spontaneously 
      mentioned. Coding of transcripts from Studies 1 and 3 led to the generation of 
      items for the SAID and HED. After item testing (Studies 2 and 4), the final SAID 
      included five items pertaining to arousal, interest in sex and sex drive with a 
      7-day recall period and the final HED included two items (energy, 
      tired/exhausted) to be administered three times per day. CONCLUSION: The SAID and 
      HED have content validity established according to regulatory guidance and, 
      therefore, the potential to provide the patient perspective of treatments for 
      hypogonadism.

TI  - The psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of the Memorial Symptom 
      Assessment scale (MSAS-Heb) in patients with breast cancer.

LID - 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2014.08.016 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: To date, no report of the psychometric properties of the Hebrew version 
      of the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS-Heb) has been available, which may 
      be a barrier to comprehensively assessing symptom frequency, severity, and 
      distress in Israeli patients with cancer. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to 
      translate the MSAS into Hebrew and to evaluate the psychometric properties in 
      Israeli patients with cancer. METHODS: The original 32-item MSAS was translated 
      into Hebrew using the forward and backward procedure, and administered to female 
      patients with early stage breast cancer (stages I-IIIA) who had received adjuvant 
      chemotherapy. In addition, patients completed a demographic questionnaire, the 
      Lee Fatigue Scale, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, the 
      General Sleep Disturbance Scale, a numeric rating scale for pain intensity, the 
      Multidimensional Quality of Life Scale-Cancer and the Karnofsky Performance 
      Status Scale. RESULTS: A sample of 110 patients was recruited (mean age 
      45.5 ± 10.1 years). The most frequent symptoms were hair loss (96.4%), lack of 
      energy (88.2%) and "I do not look like myself" (80.9%), and the most infrequent 
      were vomiting (7.3%), problems with urination (10.9%), and shortness of breath 
      (20.9%). Cronbach alpha coefficients for the MSAS-Heb subscales (i.e., physical, 
      psychological and global distress index) ranged from 0.78 to 0.90. All MSAS-Heb 
      subscales and all the other questionnaires used in this study were significantly 
      correlated (P < 0.0001), with expected directions. CONCLUSION: The MSAS-Heb is a 
      valid and a reliable measure and should be a useful tool in the clinical arena 
      and in future studies for evaluation of multiple symptoms in Israeli patients 
      with cancer.

TI  - Association of sex hormones with sexual function, vitality, and physical function 
      of symptomatic older men with low testosterone levels at baseline in the 
      testosterone trials.
PG  - 1146-55
LID - 10.1210/jc.2014-3818 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: The prevalence of sexual dysfunction, low vitality, and poor physical 
      function increases with aging, as does the prevalence of low total and free 
      testosterone (TT and FT) levels. However, the relationship between sex hormones 
      and age-related alterations in older men is not clear. OBJECTIVE: To test the 
      hypotheses that baseline serum TT, FT, estradiol (E2), and sex hormone-binding 
      globulin (SHBG) levels are independently associated with sexual function, 
      vitality, and physical function in older symptomatic men with low testosterone 
      levels participating in the Testosterone Trials (TTrials). DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional study of baseline measures in the TTrials. SETTING: The study was 
      conducted at 12 sites in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: The 788 TTrials 
      participants were ≥ 65 years and had evidence of sexual dysfunction, diminished 
      vitality, and/or mobility disability, and an average of two TT < 275 ng/dL. 
      INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Question 4 of Psychosocial Daily 
      Questionnaire (PDQ-Q4), the FACIT-Fatigue Scale, and the 6-minute walk test. 
      RESULTS: Baseline serum TT and FT, but not E2 or SHBG levels had small, but 
      statistically significant associations with validated measures of sexual desire, 
      erectile function, and sexual activity. None of these hormones was significantly 
      associated within or across trials with FACIT-Fatigue, PHQ-9 Depression or 
      Physical Function-10 scores, or gait speed. CONCLUSIONS: FT and TT levels were 
      consistently, independently, and positively associated, albeit to a small degree, 
      with measures of sexual desire, erectile function, and sexual activity, but not 
      with measures of vitality or physical function in symptomatic older men with low 
      T who qualified for the TTrials.

      apathy.
PG  - 341-7
LID - 10.1111/ene.12575 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study aimed to reveal the structural basis of 
      post-ischaemic stroke apathy, especially in relation to disruptions in structural 
      connectivity. METHODS: Eighty-eight participants were included. The Apathy 
      Evaluation Scale, clinician version, was used to characterize the severity of 
      apathy. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography was used to examine white matter 
      integrity and to reconstruct white matter networks using 90 nodes based on the 
      automated anatomical labeling atlas. The degree for each node was extracted to 
      determine the relationship to the severity of apathy. RESULTS: Apathy was not 
      significantly associated with damage to any single brain region. The degrees of 
      24 nodes (limbic system, three nodes; frontal lobe, six; basal ganglia, two; 
      temporal lobe, three; parietal lobe, three; insula, two; occipital lobe, five) 
      were significantly correlated to the Apathy Evaluation Scale scores. These 24 
      nodes constituted an apathy-related sub-network and its global and local 
      efficiencies were negatively correlated with apathy levels (global, r = -0.54, P 
      < 0.01; local, r = -0.64, P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression indicated 
      that decreased global efficiency of this sub-network was an independent risk 
      factor for apathy (odds ratio 0.03, 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.04, P = 
      0.007). Efficiencies of the non-apathy-related sub-network (the remaining 66 
      nodes) did not correlate or predict the presence of apathy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Post-stroke apathy is not due to the dysfunction of a single region or circuit. 
      Rather, it results from disconnection of a complex sub-network of brain regions. 
      This provides new insights into the neuroanatomical basis of post-stroke apathy.

TI  - Sexual activity and functioning in ovarian cancer survivors: an internet-based 
      evaluation.
PG  - 94-8
LID - 10.3109/13697137.2014.929104 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sexual dysfunction is a known complication of treatment for many 
      cancers, but there have been relatively few studies investigating outcomes for 
      ovarian cancer survivors. We have previously reported that women treated for 
      ovarian cancer experience persistent psychological and physical problems. Sexual 
      functioning was highlighted as a significant factor and we sought to investigate 
      this further. METHODS: Women were invited to complete a questionnaire using both 
      paper and online response formats. A validated tool, the Sexual Activity 
      Questionnaire, was used to obtain information from women following a diagnosis of 
      ovarian cancer. RESULTS: Across all responders (n = 102, mean age 51.3 years), 
      63% of women reported their ovarian cancer diagnosis had negatively changed their 
      sex life. The most common reasons given for an absence of sexual activity were a 
      lack of interest in sex, physical problems that prevented sex or no partner. Of 
      the 46% of responders who stated they were sexually active, 77% reported pain or 
      discomfort during intercourse and 87% described vaginal dryness. CONCLUSION: For 
      the majority of women, treatment for ovarian cancer negatively impacts on their 
      sex lives. Many of the symptoms described by participants are potentially 
      reversible and clinicians should be open to raising the issue of sexual 
      functioning with their patients.

TI  - Relationship between apathy and cognitive dysfunctions in de novo untreated 
      Parkinson's disease: a prospective longitudinal study.
PG  - 253-60
LID - 10.1111/ene.12467 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Apathy may be either a symptom of major depression or a 
      behavioral disturbance occurring in concomitance with depression or alone in 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of the present study was to determine the 
      progression of cognitive impairment in drug-naïve untreated PD patients with or 
      without clinically significant apathy. METHODS: Sixty-two PD patients with a 
      disease duration <2 years and without history of present or past therapy with 
      pro-dopaminergic agents were included and underwent the Apathy Evaluation Scale 
      (S-AES), a clinical interview based on diagnostic criteria for apathy and a 
      comprehensive neuropsychological battery to assess memory, frontal functions and 
      visuospatial functions. Two years after the first assessment, all patients were 
      re-evaluated on the S-AES, a clinical interview and neuropsychological tests. 
      RESULTS: According to the cut-off value of the S-AES and diagnostic criteria for 
      apathy, eight patients experienced apathy at both baseline and follow-up (A+A+), 
      nine patients had apathy only at follow-up (A-A+), 37 patients never experienced 
      apathy (A-A-) and eight patients showed apathy at the baseline only (A+A-). 
      Cognitive performance significantly declined in all four groups. At both baseline 
      and follow-up A+A+ performed worse than A-A- on visuospatial and frontal tests; 
      A-A+ had lower scores than A-A- on the interference task of the Stroop test 
      (IT-ST). Regression analysis showed that poor performance on the IT-ST at 
      baseline was the only independent predictor of onset of apathy at follow-up. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated a relationship between apathy and dysexecutive 
      syndrome in early PD. Reduced scores on the IT-ST may predict development of 
      apathy in PD patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Apathy is one of the most frequent symptoms of dementia, still needing 
      better measurement methods. The objective of this study was to validate a new 
      scale for apathy in institutionalized persons with dementia (APADEM-NH). METHODS: 
      The scale includes 26 items distributed in three dimensions: Deficit of Thinking 
      and Self-Generated behaviors (DT): 13 items, Emotional Blunting (EB): 7 items, 
      and Cognitive Inertia (CI): 6 items. The sample included 100 institutionalized 
      patients (90% female) with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) (57%), possible AD 
      (13%), AD + cerebral vascular disease (17%), Lewy body dementia (11%), and 
      Parkinson associated to dementia (2%), covering all stages of dementia severity 
      according to the Global Deterioration Scale and Clinical Dementia Rating. 
      Additional assessments were the Apathy Inventory, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, 
      Cornell Scale for Depression, and the tested scale. Re-test and inter-rater 
      reliability were carried out in 50 patients. RESULTS: All subscales lacked 
      relevant floor and ceiling effects (<15%). Internal consistency for each 
      dimension was (Cronbach's α): DT = 0.88, EB = 0.83, CI = 0.88; item-total 
      correlations were >0.40; and item homogeneity 0.36-0.51. Test-retest reliability 
      for the items was kW = 0.48-0.92; for the subscales, intraclass correlation 
      coefficient (ICC) = 0.80-0.88; and for the total score, ICC = 0.90. Inter-rater 
      reliability reached kW values of 0.84-1.00; subscales ICC, 0.97-0.99, and total 
      score ICC, 0.99. Standard error of measurement for total score was 6.41 and 
      internal validity ranged from rS = 0.69-0.80. CONCLUSIONS: APADEM-NH proved to be 
      feasible, reliable, and valid for apathy assessment in institutionalized patients 
      suffering mild to severe dementia, discerning well between apathy and depression.

AB  - A definable concept of symptomatic remission in schizophrenia has been proposed 
      by the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group (RSWG). Nevertheless no studies 
      to date assessed eventual differences in core symptoms at onset between remitters 
      and non-remitters. The present study evaluated whether the severity of core 
      symptoms differed among 48 patients with first episode schizophrenia (FES), and 
      whether it predicted long-term (16-years) remission. Particularly, the present 
      study aimed to verify if RSWG remission criteria might identify a sub-group of 
      patients with mild core symptoms at their first episode. In the present study the 
      severity of core symptoms was significantly lower in remitted than in 
      non-remitted patients; interestingly, five out of the eight core symptoms already 
      satisfied the severity criteria for remission in most remitted patients. Among 
      the core symptoms only the severity of social withdrawal predicted the long-term 
      outcome, while age at onset, duration of untreated psychosis and employment 
      status did not exert any effect. Concluding, patients with FES presenting, mild 
      core symptoms, particularly low negative symptoms, were more likely to reach 
      long-term remission. Therefore, RSWG remission criteria seem to identify a 
      subgroup of FES patients with mild severe core symptoms so with a higher 
      probability to reach remission.

TI  - Neuropsychiatric Symptoms Predict Functional Status in Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 863-9
LID - 10.3233/JAD-150018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive deficits are presumed to be the primary driver of 
      functional impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, functional impairment 
      is likely multifactorially determined. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine 
      the relative contribution of neuropsychiatric symptoms in predicting ratings of 
      functional status. METHODS: A total of 223 patients received routine neurological 
      and neuropsychological evaluations and met criteria of probable AD dementia based 
      on the McKhann criteria. Demographic, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric variables 
      were entered in a hierarchical linear regression analysis to predict functional 
      status as measured by the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). RESULTS: The 
      total model explained 29.7% of the variance (p <  0.001) in FAQ. Importantly, 
      neuropsychiatric variables explained 12.7% of the unique variance, with apathy 
      and sleep as significant contributors. CONCLUSION: Two neuropsychiatric 
      variables, apathy and changes in sleep/nighttime behaviors, predicted ratings of 
      functional status in AD patients independent of age, global cognition, memory and 
      executive function measures, and depressive symptoms. These results highlight the 
      importance of neuropsychiatric symptoms in understanding and potentially treating 
      the functional limitations so prevalent in AD.

TI  - The Apathy Evaluation Scale: A Comparison of Subject, Informant, and Clinician 
      Report in Cognitively Normal Elderly and Mild Cognitive Impairment.
PG  - 421-32
LID - 10.3233/JAD-150146 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a common neuropsychiatric symptom in Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Detecting apathy accurately 
      may facilitate earlier diagnosis of AD. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is a 
      promising tool for measurement of apathy in prodromal and possibly preclinical 
      AD. OBJECTIVE: To compare the three AES sub-scales - subject-reported (AES-S), 
      informant-reported (AES-I), and clinician-reported (AES-C) - over time in 
      individuals at risk for AD due to MCI and advanced age (cognitively normal [CN] 
      elderly). METHODS: Mixed effects longitudinal models were used to assess 
      predictors of score for each AES sub-scale. Cox proportional hazards models were 
      used to assess which AES sub-scales predict progression from MCI to AD dementia. 
      RESULTS: Fifty-seven MCI and 18 CN subjects (ages 53-86) were followed for 1.4 ± 
      1.2 years and 0.7 ± 0.7 years, respectively. Across the three mixed effects 
      longitudinal models, the common findings were associations between greater apathy 
      and greater years in study, a baseline diagnosis of MCI (compared to CN), and 
      male gender. CN elderly self-reported greater apathy compared to that reported by 
      informants and clinicians, while individuals with MCI under-reported their apathy 
      compared to informants and clinicians. Of the three sub-scales, the AES-C best 
      predicted transition from MCI to AD dementia. CONCLUSION: In a sample of CN 
      elderly and elderly with MCI, apathy increased over time, particularly in men and 
      those with MCI. AES-S scores may be more sensitive than AES-I and AES-C scores in 
      CN elderly, but less reliable if subjects have MCI. Moreover, the AES-C sub-scale 
      predicted progression from MCI to AD dementia.

TI  - Rating Apathy in Huntington’s Disease: Patients and Companions Agree.
PG  - 49-59
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a common feature of Huntington’s disease (HD), even from 
      early disease. However, patients are believed to lack insight into their own 
      apathy and therefore clinicians and/or companions are relied upon to estimate the 
      extent of a patient’s apathy. In addition, the evolution of apathy over time in 
      HD has not been unequivocally established. OBJECTIVEs: The purpose of this study 
      was to determine whether HD patient’s self-rated apathy scores were consistent 
      with the scores given by companions who were also asked to rate the patients 
      apathy. Furthermore, the clinical correlates of apathy and its stability over 
      time were examined for both self-rated and companion-rated scores. METHODs: 
      Apathy was measured in a large cross-sectional population of HD patients ranging 
      from early to late stage disease (n = 106) using the Apathy Evaluation Scale; a 
      subgroup of whom were followed longitudinally (n = 62) on average 18.7 (1.2 SD) 
      months later. Comparisons were made between self-rated and companion-rated apathy 
      and the relationship between apathy and motor, cognitive and functional 
      performance was explored. RESULTS: Analysis of the cross-sectional data revealed 
      that self-rated and companion-rated apathy were highly correlated, establishing 
      the validity of using self-rated instead of, or in combination with, 
      companion-rated assessments of apathy in future studies. Both self-rated and 
      companion-rated scores had a relationship with motor and functional impairment, 
      but had a complex relationship with cognition. The results of the longitudinal 
      comparison revealed that apathy did not change over time in this 
      cohort.CONCLUSIONs: Apathy can be equally well assessed by either patients or 
      companions and does not change significantly over an18 month period. These 
      findings have implications in the design of studies looking at treating this 
      important aspect of HD.

PG  - 42-47
LID - 10.17116/jnevro20151152142-47 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare psychometric and molecular-genetic characteristics of 
      depression caused by ischemic heart disease (IHD) and depression in patients with 
      IHD caused by other psychogenic factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and 
      thirty-five patients with depression comorbid to ischemic heart disease (IHD) 
      were examined. Depression was associated with IHD in 71 patients (group 1). In 64 
      patients, depression was caused by other psychogenic factors (group 2). The 
      HAMD-21 scale was used to measure depressive symptoms. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: 
      The comparative analysis of the core symptoms of depression demonstrated that 
      group 1 had a peculiar psychometric profile with marked apathy, which was not 
      accompanied by marked hypothymia, guilt feelings or anxiety, compared to group 2. 
      The molecular-genetic correlate of this profile was found. It included a

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The increasing population of elderly people in Japan has accelerated 
      the demand for a simple screening test to detect cognitive and affective declines 
      in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the early stage of dementia. Methods We 
      compared the cognitive and affective functions, activities of daily living (ADLs) 
      and the results of four computerized touch-panel screening tests in 41 MCI 
      subjects, 124 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 75 age- and 
      gender-matched normal controls. RESULTS: All computerized touch-panel games were 
      successfully used to discriminate the AD patients from the normal controls (** 
      p<0.01). Although there were no differences in the findings of the conventional 
      cognitive assessments, the results of the flipping cards game were significantly 
      different (** p<0.01) between the normal controls (19.3 ± 9.5 sec) and MCI 
      subjects (30.9 ± 18.4 sec). Three conventional affective assessments, the ADL 
      score, Abe's behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (ABS) (** p<0.01) 
      and the apathy scale (AS) (* p<0.05), could be used to discriminate the MCI 
      subjects (ABS, 0.9 ± 1.5; AS, 12.8 ± 5.9) from the normal controls (ABS, 0.1 ± 
      0.4; AS, 8.9 ± 5.3). CONCLUSION: In the present study, all four touch-panel 
      screening tests could be employed to discriminate AD patients from normal 
      controls, whereas only the flipping cards game was effective for distinguishing 
      MCI subjects from normal controls. Therefore, this novel touch-panel screening 
      test may be a more sensitive tool for detecting MCI subjects among elderly 
      patients.

TI  - Burden of Behavioral and Psychiatric Symptoms in People Screened Positive for 
      Dementia in Primary Care: Results of the DelpHi-Study.
PG  - 451-9
LID - 10.3233/JAD-143114 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited knowledge about the range and effects of 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms shown by persons with dementia (PWD) living in the 
      community and their related caregiver burden. OBJECTIVE: To examine 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms in PWD in primary care with regard to frequency, 
      severity, and burden to caregiver; to compare PWD with and without symptoms with 
      regard to sociodemographics, care-related, and disease-related variables; and to 
      identify variables associated with symptoms. METHODS: A general physician-based 
      epidemiological cohort of 248 people screened positive for dementia over the age 
      of 70 (living at home) and their caregivers, was assessed using the 
      Neuropsychiatric Interview (NPI), sociodemographics, and disease-related 
      variables. RESULTS: In preliminary analyses, neuropsychiatric symptoms were 
      frequent in PWD. Prevalence numbers ofdysphoria/depression, apathy, and 
      agitation/aggression were each more than 30% . The severity of neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms in people screened positive for dementia in primary care is moderate 
      with a mean NPI score of m = 11.91 (SD = 16.0). Overall, caregiver distress is 
      low, indicated by a total distress score of m = 5.94 (SD = 7.2, range 0-39). 
      Common or frequent symptoms are not necessarily the most distressing symptoms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in people screened positive for 
      dementia in primary care. While frequency, severity, and perceived distress might 
      be low in the total sample, we identified the dimensions delusions, aggression, 
      anxiety, disinhibition, and depression to be perceived "severely" to "extremely" 
      distressing in more than 30% of the caregivers affected. The association between 
      activities of daily living and symptoms needs further attention.

AB  - Although major depressive disorder (MDD) has a variety of symptoms beyond the 
      affective dimensions, the factor structure and contents of comprehensive 
      psychiatric symptoms of this disorder have rarely been explored using the 18-item 
      Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). We aimed to identify the factor structure 
      of the 18-item BPRS in Korean MDD patients. A total of 258 MDD patients were 
      recruited from a multicenter sample of the Clinical Research Center for 
      Depression of South Korea study. Psychometric scales were used to assess overall 
      psychiatric symptoms (BPRS), depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), 
      anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), global severity (Clinical Global 
      Impression of Severity Scale), suicidal ideation (Scale for Suicide Ideation), 
      functioning (Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale), and quality 
      of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment-abbreviated 
      version). Common factor analysis with oblique rotation was used to yield factor 
      structure. A four-factor structure was designed and interpreted by the symptom 
      dimensions to reflect mood disturbance, positive symptoms/apathy, bipolarity, and 
      thought distortion/mannerism. These individual factors were also significantly 
      correlated with clinical variables. The findings of this study support the view 
      that the BPRS may be a promising measuring tool for the initial assessment of MDD 
      patients. In addition, the four-factor structure of the BPRS may be useful in 
      understanding the mood and psychotic characteristics of these patients.

      questionnaire for dementia.
PG  - 103-10
LID - 10.1017/S1041610214001811 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are many quality of life (QOL) instruments for evaluating 
      dementia patients. The QOL questionnaire for Dementia (QOL-D) is one of such 
      instruments and a validated objective measure of QOL for patients with dementia. 
      It comprises 31 items encompassing six domains. However, with 31 items, its 
      length is a disadvantage. The purpose of this study was to develop a short 
      version of QOL-D (short QOL-D). METHODS: We used data from two studies. The 
      participants were 264 inpatients with dementia in the first sample and 395 
      outpatients at a memory clinic in the second sample. We used maximum likelihood 
      factor analysis with promax rotation to reduce the number of items. RESULTS: We 
      produced a nine-item version of QOL-D (short QOL-D) with positive (six items) and 
      negative (three items) dimensions. The correlation coefficients of short and 
      total versions of QOL-D were 0.892-0.918 for total scores, 0.903-0.936 for 
      positive dimension scores, and 0.788-0.837 for negative dimension scores. Total 
      short QOL-D scores showed a significant correlation to the Geriatric Depression 
      Scale score and the apathy score of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The short QOL-D produced results comparable with that of the full version. 
      Reducing the number of items may make administration of the instrument easier.

      of Apathy Evaluation Scale.
PG  - 2319-28
LID - 10.1007/s00415-014-7498-1 [doi]
AB  - Apathy is a behavioural disturbance occurring alone or in concomitance with 
      depression in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we present a validation study for 
      the self-report version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-S), carried out in a 
      sample of 60 non-demented, non-depressed untreated, drug-naïve, de novo PD 
      patients; 20 patients of the sample (33.3%) were classified as apathetic 
      according to current clinical criteria. All enrolled patients completed the AES-S 
      and a neurological and cognitive assessment. Mean AES-S score was 34.43. AES-S 
      did not show floor or ceiling effect. Cronbach's alpha was 0.872. Principal 
      component analysis revealed three factors: the first (34.4% of the variance) 
      represented constitutive aspects of the construct of apathy; the second (8.5% of 
      the variance) represented a social dimension; the third factor (7.9% of the 
      variance) represented a dimension related to insight. With respect to clinical 
      criteria for apathy considered as the gold standard, receiver operating 
      characteristics curve analysis showed that a cut-off of 36/37 has the maximum 
      discrimination power. High sensitivity and negative predictive values were 
      obtained with cut-off scores of 33/34 or lower; high specificity and positive 
      predictive values were obtained with cut-off scores of 38/39 or higher. AES-S 
      score correlated with scores on frontal tasks, but not on Beck Depression 
      Inventory, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr scale. The 
      AES-S is a reliable and valid questionnaire for detecting apathy in PD. For 
      screening purposes a 33/34 cut-off score is indicated, but a 38/39 cut-off score 
      is necessary when a high specificity is desired.

TI  - The cognition and emotional well-being indices of the Parkinson's disease 
      questionnaire-39: what do they really measure?

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Parkinson's disease questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) is a common 
      measure of health related quality of life (HRQoL) that is widely used with 
      Parkinson disease (PD) patients. Previous evidence suggests that the PDQ-39 
      reflects at least 8 dimensions (i.e., Emotion, Cognitions, Mobility, etc). To 
      date, little research has examined the external/convergent validity of the 
      Cognitions and Emotional Well-being domains of the PDQ-39. METHODS: A convenience 
      sample of 303 PD patients underwent a comprehensive multi-domain 
      neuropsychological evaluation, including tests of execution function, episodic 
      verbal memory, processing speed, language and working memory, as well as 
      completing measures of depression, apathy, state and trait anxiety and HRQoL 
      (PDQ-39). Hierarchical regressions were conducted in order to examine the 
      relationship between scores on neuropsychological tests and the Cognitions index, 
      as well as mood measures and the Emotional Well-being index of the PDQ-39. 
      RESULTS: Neuropsychological test performance did not account for a significant 
      amount of variance in the PDQ-39 Cognitions index scores. Instead, it was 
      depression that significantly contributed to the Cognitions index, above and 
      beyond neuropsychological performance. The PDQ-39 Emotional Well-being index was 
      also related to mood measures, primarily depression and trait anxiety. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The PDQ-39 Cognition index may be more related to mood functioning, 
      as opposed to cognitive functioning, and should not be considered a "proxy" for 
      cognitive functioning. Future studies are needed to better explain the construct 
      of this index.

AB  - PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH: (a) To identify the degree of much loneliness reported 
      in the Portuguese population over 50 years of age and (b) test whether loneliness 
      can be predicted by socio-demographic, health related or social characteristic of 
      the sample other than age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1174 late middle age and older 
      adults were interviewed face to face by different interviewers across the 
      country; after the informed consent was signed, we asked the participants several 
      socio-demographic and health-related questions; finally we asked "How often do 
      you feel lonely?" and participants responded according to a five point Likert 
      scale. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: The results showed that 12% of participants reporting 
      feeling lonely often or always, whereas 40% reporting never feeling lonely. The 
      remaining 48% self-reported they felt lonely seldom or sometimes. Additionally, 
      results show that, when taken together, variables such as marital status, type of 
      housing, residence settings, health conditions, social satisfaction, social 
      isolation, lack of interest, transportation, and age were predictors of 
      loneliness. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: (1) The association of loneliness with advanced 
      age has been greatly exaggerated by mass media and common sense; (2) But although 
      our findings did not confirm the most alarmist views, the 12% of older adults 
      reporting that they are feeling lonely always or often should be cause for 
      attention and concern. It is necessary to understand the meaning, reasons and 
      level of suffering implied on those feelings of loneliness. (3) Our findings 
      suggest that it makes no sense to construe age as a singular feature or cause for 
      feelings of loneliness. Instead, age and also a number of other features combine 
      to predict feelings of loneliness. But even with our predictor variables there 
      was a substantial of variance left unexplained. Therefore it is necessary to 
      continue exploring how feelings of loneliness arise from the experience of living 
      and how they can be changed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: There are problems with the fatigue measures currently used in 
      depressed patients. The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) covering 
      general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced activity and reduced 
      motivation has been widely used in patients with cancer and chronic fatigue 
      syndrome. To address the multidimensional nature of fatigue, we examined the 
      validity and reliability of a Chinese version of the MFI-20 in major depressive 
      disorder (MDD). METHODS: Data were derived from a randomized controlled trial of 
      acupuncture in 137 patients with partially remitted MDD. The test-retest 
      reliability, internal consistency, construct and concurrent validity and 
      sensitivity to change of the MFI-20 were analyzed. RESULTS: The MFI-20 was found 
      to have good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.89) and 1-week test-retest 
      reliability (Pearson correlation of the total score=0.73). Factor analysis showed 
      5 factors, but the factor structure was different from that in medical 
      conditions. The 2 most prominent factors, explaining 46% of the total variance, 
      were both associated with physical and mental energy but different in directions. 
      There were adequate concurrent validity and sensitivity to change as evidenced by 
      the significant correlations between the MFI-20 scores and depressive and anxiety 
      symptoms, general health and quality of life. CONCLUSION: The Chinese MFI-20 is a 
      valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of fatigue in MDD patients with 
      residual symptoms. The construct of fatigue in MDD seems to be different from 
      that in medical conditions. Further studies are needed to examine the MFI-20 in 
      MDD patients from other cultures.

AB  - Although aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) accounts for only 3-5% of all 
      strokes, a high degree of morbidity has been reported in this relatively young 
      subset of patients. Neuropsychiatric disturbance has often been neglected in 
      these reports. We aimed to investigate the pattern and pathological factors of 
      chronic neuropsychiatric disturbance in aSAH patients. This cross-sectional 
      observational four-center study was carried out in Hong Kong. Neuropsychiatric 
      outcome (Neuropsychiatric Inventory Chinese Version [CNPI]) assessments were 
      conducted cross-sectionally 1-4 years after ictus. Pathological factors 
      considered were early brain injury as assessed by admission World Federation of 
      Neurosurgical Societies grade, aneurysm treatment (clipping versus coiling), 
      delayed cerebral infarction, and chronic hydrocephalus. One hundred and three 
      aSAH patients' spouses or caregivers completed the CNPI. Forty-two (41%) patients 
      were reported to have one or more domain(s) of neuropsychiatric disturbance. 
      Common neuropsychiatric disturbance domains included agitation/aggression, 
      depression, apathy/indifference, irritability/lability, and appetite/eating 
      disturbance. Chronic neuropsychiatric disturbance was associated with presence of 
      chronic hydrocephalus. A subscore consisting of the five commonly affected 
      domains seems to be a suitable tool for aSAH patients and should be further 
      validated and replicated in future studies.

AB  - CONTEXT: Multidimensional questionnaires estimating cancer-related fatigue (CRF) 
      as a symptom cluster or a clinical syndrome primarily have been used and 
      validated in English-speaking populations. However, cultural issues and language 
      peculiarities can affect CRF assessment OBJECTIVES: The main aims of this study 
      were to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Polish version of the 
      Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 (MFI-20) and to deliver to clinicians a 
      multidimensional tool for CRF assessment in Polish-speaking patients with cancer. 
      METHODS: After forward-backward translation procedures, the Polish version of 
      MFI-20 was administered to 340 cancer patients. The Polish MFI-20 was appraised 
      in terms of acceptability, reliability, and validity. Internal consistency was 
      assessed by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficients. Structural validity was 
      evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis. RESULTS: The translated MFI-20 was 
      well accepted; 90% of subjects fully completed the questionnaire. The overall 
      Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.9, ranging from 0.57 to 0.81. All correlation 
      coefficients among Numeric Rating Scale-fatigue, fatigue-related items from the 
      European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
      Core-30 questionnaire, and the MFI--20 were statistically significant (P < 
      0.001). Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated good structural validity and 
      revealed only three dimensions in the Polish version of the MFI-20-physical and 
      mental fatigue as well as reduced motivation. CONCLUSION: The Polish version of 
      the MFI-20 is well accepted by patients, reliable, and a valid instrument to 
      assess CRF in Polish cancer patients.

TI  - Issues patients would like to discuss at their review consultation in breast 
      cancer clinics--a cross-sectional survey.
PG  - 568-79
LID - 10.1700/1660.18184 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND BACKGROUND: In breast cancer (BC) there are different therapies 
      available with different side effects affecting the health-related quality of 
      life (HRQOL) of patients. Here we report a novel tool, the BC-specific Patient 
      Concerns Inventory (PCI). This work includes a survey that is part of the 
      validation process to allow a larger cohort and comparisons with clinical 
      characteristics. We report the concerns that BC patients would like to discuss in 
      the outpatient clinic - using the PCI - and also their choice of 
      multidisciplinary team members they would like to see. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: 
      We carried out a cross-sectional survey - using the BC-specific PCI, the EORTC 
      QLQ-C30 and the EORTC BC QLQ-BR23 - of patients who had completed their initial 
      treatment and were attending a review outpatient clinic. 249 patients were 
      recruited from February to July 2012. RESULTS: Survey responses were obtained 
      from 80% (200/249). The three most frequent items were fear of cancer coming back 
      (62%, 124), breast sensitivity/pain (46%, 92), and fatigue/tiredness and low 
      energy levels overall (46%, 92). The most frequently selected members of the 
      multidisciplinary team that patients wished to see were the breast care nurse 
      (46%, 92), the medical oncologist (28%, 55) and the psychologist (20%, 40). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The PCI provides the opportunity for multiprofessional engagement 
      across a range of issues specific to BC. It can identify issues relating to 
      physical, psychological, sexual and social functioning, as well as issues 
      relating to body image and lifestyle.

TI  - Life concerns of elderly people living at home determined as by Community General 
      Support Center staff: implications for organizing a more effective integrated 
      community care system. The Kurihara Project.
PG  - 188-95
LID - 10.1111/psyg.12061 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Japan, the integrated community care system aims to enable people 
      to continue to live in their homes. Based on the concept, one of the activities 
      of a Community General Support Center (CGSC) is to provide preventive 
      intervention based on a Community Support Program. Currently, a Basic Checklist 
      (BC) is sent to elderly people to identify persons appropriate for a Secondary 
      Prevention Program. METHODS: To find people who had not responded to the BC, CGSC 
      staff evaluated the files of 592 subjects who had participated in the Kurihara 
      Project to identify activities they cannot do that they did in the past, 
      decreased activity levels at home, loss of interaction with people other than 
      their family, and the need for medical interventions. This information was 
      classified, when applicable, into the following categories: (A) 'no life 
      concerns'; (B) 'undecided'; and (C) 'life concerns'. The relationships between 
      these classifications and clinical information, certified need for long-term 
      care, and items on the BC were examined. RESULTS: The numbers of subjects in 
      categories A, B, and C were 291, 42, and 186, respectively. Life concerns were 
      related to scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating, global cognitive function, 
      depressive state, and apathy. Most items on the BC were not associated with 
      classification into category C, but ≥25% of the subjects had life concerns 
      related to these items. DISCUSSION: Assessment of life concerns by the CGSC staff 
      has clinical validity. The results suggest that there are people who do not 
      respond to the checklist or apply for Long-Term Care Insurance, meaning that they 
      'hide' in the community, probably due to apathy or depressive state. To organize 
      a more effective integrated community care system, the CGSC staff should focus 
      mainly on preventive care.

TI  - Motivational deficits and cognitive test performance in schizophrenia.
PG  - 1058-65
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2014.1105 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Motivational and cognitive deficits are core features of 
      schizophrenia, both closely linked with functional outcomes. Although poor effort 
      and decreased motivation are known to affect performance on cognitive tests, the 
      extent of this relationship is unclear in patients with schizophrenia. OBJECTIVE: 
      To evaluate the association between intrinsic motivation and cognitive test 
      performance in patients with schizophrenia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      Cross-sectional and 6-month prospective follow-up study performed at 57 sites in 
      the United States, including academic and community medical treatment centers, 
      participating in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness 
      study. The primary sample included 431 stable patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of 
      schizophrenia currently receiving a stable medication regimen. INTERVENTIONS: 
      Cognitive performance and intrinsic motivation were evaluated using a 
      comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and a derived measure from the 
      Heinrichs-Carpenter Quality of Life Scale, respectively. Symptom severity and 
      functional status were also assessed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary 
      outcome variable was global neurocognition. Individual domains of cognition were 
      also evaluated for their association with motivation. RESULTS: Level of intrinsic 
      motivation was significantly and positively correlated with global cognitive test 
      performance, a relationship that held for each domain of cognition evaluated 
      (correlation range, 0.20-0.34; P < .001). This association was found to be 
      reliable after statistically accounting for positive, negative, depressive, and 
      overall symptom severity (P < .05) and after accounting for community functioning 
      (P < .001). The relationship between motivation and cognitive performance also 
      remained significant after controlling for antipsychotic dose (P < .05). 
      Prospective increase in motivation during the 6-month follow-up was also found to 
      be significantly related to improvement in global cognitive performance 
      (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The present findings provide strong support 
      for a robust and reliable relationship between motivation and cognitive 
      performance and suggest that test performance is not purely a measure of ability. 
      Future studies assessing cognition in patients with schizophrenia should consider 
      potential moderating variables such as effort and motivation. Implications for 
      the assessment and interpretation of cognitive impairment based on 
      neuropsychological test measures in schizophrenia are discussed, especially in 
      the case of clinical trials for cognition-enhancing treatments. TRIAL

TI  - [A behavioural rating scale of activity engagement in psychogeriatric day care].
PG  - 208-25
LID - 10.1007/s12439-014-0080-6 [doi]
AB  - The Participation Scale was developed as an observational measure of activity 
      engagement (as rated by group facilitators) of adult day care clients with mild 
      to moderate dementia. In a consecutive sample of 448 subjects Mokken scaling 
      procedure was conducted to assess the latent structure of 27 questionnaire items. 
      The study included an exploratory and a confirmatory approach. For that purpose 
      the sample was randomly divided into two halves. Exploratory analysis revealed 
      three dimensions of participation that adequately captured the item structure: 
      motivation (10 items; Loevinger's H = 0.48), competence (7 items; H = 0.56) and 
      self-confidence (4 items; H = 0.57). The structure was validated in a 
      confirmatory analysis. In a stepwise multiple regression model 49% of the 
      variance in motivation was explained by independent behavioural measures of 
      apathy and affect. Apathy and cognitive impairment were significant predictors of 
      competence in participation (R(2) = 31.2%). Negative affect was the main 
      predictor of reduced self-confidence (R(2) = 37.9%). Cross-validation of these 
      exploratory regression models on the confirmatory sample explained 39.6%, 29.2% 
      and 23.1% of the variance in motivation, competence and self-confidence, 
      respectively. Test-retest intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC2(A,1)) as 
      determined in a random subsample of 56 participants, were 0.77 (motivation), 0.85 
      (competence) and 0.76 (self-confidence). The three measures allow the

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is critical to employ accurate measures when assessing physical 
      activity (PA) barriers in any subpopulation, yet existing measures are not 
      appropriate for persons with blindness or visual impairment (PBVI) due to a lack 
      of validity or reliability evidence. OBJECTIVE: To develop and calibrate a PA 
      barrier scale for PBVI. METHODS: An expert panel (n = 3) and 18 PBVI were 
      recruited to establish content validity for a PA barriers subscale; 160 PBVI (96 
      females) completed the scale along with the Physical Activity Scale for 
      Individuals with Physical Disabilities for calibration. To establish 
      construct-related validity evidence, Confirmative factor analysis (CFA) and Rasch 
      analysis were applied. To investigate internal consistency and reliability, 
      Cronbach's alpha and the reliability coefficient (R) were employed, respectively. 
      RESULTS: Following CFA and Rasch analyses, five items were eliminated due to 
      misfits; reliability coefficients were unchanged upon deletion of these items. 
      The barriers perceived by PBVI to have the most negative impact on PA included 
      "lack of self-discipline" (logit = 1.40) and "lack of motivation" (logit = 1.27). 
      "Too many stairs in the exercise facility" (logit = -1.49) was perceived to have 
      the least impact. CONCLUSIONS: The newly-developed scale was found to be a valid 
      and reliable tool for evaluating PA barriers in PBVI. To enhance promotion of 
      health-producing levels of PA in PBVI, practitioners should consider applying 
      this new tool as a precursor to programs aimed at improving PA participation in 
      this group.

TI  - A novel tool to detect behavioural symptoms in ALS.
PG  - 298-304
LID - 10.3109/21678421.2014.896927 [doi]
AB  - There is need for a valid, sensitive and short instrument capable of detecting 
      and quantifying behavioural changes in ALS, which can be utilized in clinical and 
      research settings. This study aimed to 1) develop and validate such an 
      instrument; 2) verify the most common behavioural symptoms; and 3) investigate 
      longitudinal changes over a six-month period. Two hundred and nineteen patients 
      were included. The development sample (n = 140) was used to determine the most 
      appropriate items to include in the new tool, the Motor Neuron Disease 
      Behavioural Instrument (MiND-B) * , via a data-driven approach. An independent 
      sample (n = 79) validated the tool. A more comprehensive sample (n = 50, 
      sub-classified into ALS and ALS plus) was utilized to verify if the MiND-B could 
      detect ALS plus patients. Finally, 20 ALS patients completed the MiND-B after a 
      six-month period. Apathy, disinhibition and stereotypical behaviour were all 
      found to be very common symptoms in ALS occurring in 75%, 66% and 58%, 
      respectively, of cases. Notably, the MiND-B could identify ALS plus patients 
      without standard cognitive assessments. In conclusion, the MiND-B tool can detect 
      patients with ALS plus reliably, by means of questions to the informant. This 
      test could enable ALS centres to evaluate non-motor symptoms and adapt management 
      and decision-making approaches as necessary. *only available in the online

AB  - White matter (WM) tract alterations were assessed in patients with progressive 
      supranuclear palsy (PSP) relative to healthy controls and patients with 
      idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) to explore the relationship of WM tract 
      damage with clinical disease severity, performance on cognitive tests, and 
      apathy. 37 PSP patients, 41 PD patients, and 34 healthy controls underwent an MRI 
      scan and clinical testing to evaluate physical disability, cognitive impairment, 
      and apathy. In PSP, the contribution of WM tract damage to global disease 
      severity and cognitive and behavioural disturbances was assessed using Random 
      Forest analysis. Relative to controls, PSP patients showed diffusion tensor (DT) 
      MRI abnormalities of the corpus callosum, superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), 
      cingulum and uncinate fasciculus bilaterally, and right inferior longitudinal 
      fasciculus. Corpus callosum and SCP DT MRI measures distinguished PSP from PD 
      patients with high accuracy (area under the curve ranging from 0.89 to 0.72). In 
      PSP, DT MRI metrics of the corpus callosum and superior cerebellar peduncles were 
      the best predictors of global disease severity scale scores. DT MRI metrics of 
      the corpus callosum, right superior longitudinal and inferior longitudinal 
      fasciculus, and left uncinate were the best predictors of executive dysfunction. 
      In PSP, apathy severity was related to the damage to the corpus callosum, right 
      superior longitudinal, and uncinate fasciculi. In conclusion, WM tract damage 
      contributes to the motor, cognitive, and behavioural deficits in PSP. DT MRI 
      offers markers for PSP diagnosis, assessment, and monitoring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) is often used to assess 
      depressive symptoms among stroke patients, but more evidence is needed regarding 
      its psychometric properties in this population. The purpose of this study was to 
      assess the BDI-II׳s psychometric properties using a Rasch model application in a 
      sample of patients 6 months after a first clinical stroke. METHODS: Data were 
      collected prospectively from patient medical records and from questionnaires 
      (with assistance if needed) as a part of a longitudinal study of poststroke 
      fatigue. Data from the 6-month follow-up were used in this analysis. The sample 
      consisted of 106 patients with first-ever stroke recruited from two Norwegian 
      hospitals between 2007 and 2008. Depressive symptoms were measured with the 
      BDI-II. Rasch analysis was used to assess the BDI-II׳s psychometric properties in 
      this sample. RESULTS: Five BDI-II items did not demonstrate acceptable 
      goodness-of-fit to the Rasch model: items 10 (crying), 16 (changes in sleep), 17 
      (irritability), 18 (changes in appetite), and 21 (loss of interest in sex). If 
      these 5 items were removed, the resulting 16-item version not only had fewer 
      items, it also had better internal scale validity, person-response validity, and 
      person-separation reliability than the original 21-item version in this sample of 
      stroke survivors. LIMITATIONS: The study did not include a clinical evaluation of 
      depression. CONCLUSION: A 16-item version of the BDI-II, omitting items 10, 16, 
      17, 18 and 21, may be more appropriate than the original 21-item BDI-II for use 
      as a unidimensional measure of depression in patients following first-ever 
      stroke.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Heinrichs-Carpenter Quality of Life Scale (QLS) is the most 
      extensively used real-world community functioning scale in schizophrenia 
      research. However, the extensive time required to administer it and the inclusion 
      of items that overlap conceptually with negative symptoms limit its use across 
      studies. The present study examined the validity and utility of two abbreviated 
      QLS measures against the full QLS excluding negative symptom items. METHOD: The 
      sample included 1427 patients with schizophrenia who completed the baseline visit 
      in the CATIE study. The validity of two abbreviated QLS measures (7-item and 
      4-item) were examined with the full QLS, excluding the intrapsychic foundations 
      subscale, using correlation analysis. The utility of the abbreviated measures was 
      explored by examining associations between the functioning scales and clinical 
      variables and longitudinal change. RESULTS: Both abbreviated QLS measures were 
      highly predictive of the full QLS (both r=0.91, p<0.001), with no difference in 
      predictive value between the abridged measures. Functional status was 
      significantly associated with symptoms and cognition. Importantly, the strength 
      of these associations was similar between the abbreviated and full QLS. Finally, 
      multiple regression models examining the explanatory power of amotivation/apathy 
      in predicting functioning scores after other symptoms and neurocognition had been 
      accounted for were essentially identical irrespective of the QLS instrument used 
      as the dependent measure. Longitudinal change was also similar across the three 
      scales. CONCLUSIONS: The 7-item abbreviated QLS is recommended as a brief measure 
      of community functioning for individuals with schizophrenia, especially when 
      assessment of functional outcome is not the focus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postural instability (PI) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated 
      with depression and apathy based on UPDRS scores. We sought to examine the link 
      using more objective PI measures. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, depression and 
      apathy data were recorded for PD patients prospectively recruited from an 
      outpatient university movement disorders clinic. PI was objectively evaluated 
      using the standing center of pressure sway area. RESULTS: Thirty-seven PD 
      patients participated in the study. Bivariate analysis revealed that PI was 
      significantly correlated to both apathy (p=0.018) and depression (p=0.014). 
      Hierarchical regression revealed that apathy significantly predicted PI but 
      depression did not significantly add to the prediction. Also, depression did not 
      significantly predict PI and the addition of apathy did not increase this 
      prediction. CONCLUSION: Apathy and depression are both associated with objective 
      measures of PI, and apathy appears a stronger predictor of PI than depression. 
      Concomitant improvement in PI may be important to consider when measuring apathy 
      or depression interventions in PD.

AB  - Reliable and valid measurement of behavioural and psychological symptoms of 
      dementia (BPSD) is important for research and clinical practice. Here we provide 
      an overview of the different instruments and discuss issues involved in the 
      choice of the most appropriate instrument to measure BPSD in research. A list of 
      BPSD instruments was generated. For each instrument Pubmed and SCOPUS were 
      searched for articles that reported on their use or quality. Eighty-three 
      instruments that are used to measure BPSD were identified. Instruments differ in 
      length and detail, whether the interview is with participants, informants or by 
      observation, the target sample and the time frames for use. Reliability and 
      validity is generally good, but reported in few independent samples. When 
      choosing a BPSD instrument for research the research question should be carefully 
      scrutinised and the symptoms of interest, population, quality, detail, time frame 
      and practical issues should be considered.

PG  - 174-81
LID - 10.3109/14992027.2013.852256 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the tactics people use when aural communication fails 
      owing to environmental circumstances or impaired hearing. DESIGN: Persons with 
      different degrees of self-reported hearing impairment completed an online 
      questionnaire constructed from items taken from the literature on communication 
      strategies but reworded to be understood by people with normal hearing. Tactics 
      were examined for frequency of use in two severities of impairment and between 
      genders. All the data were then factor analysed and factor scores related to 
      variables of relevance to communication. STUDY SAMPLE: A large convenience sample 
      (n = 188) with a range of self-assessed hearing impairment from normal to 
      profound. RESULTS: Descriptive data revealed some differences in frequency of use 
      in relation to severity and gender. Factor analysis yielded six clearly 
      interpretable factors, the largest relating to disengagement (avoidance). 
      Self-assessed impairment was chiefly associated with a speech reading tactic, 
      negatively with environmental optimization strategies, and to a small extent with 
      disengagement and conversation repair. CONCLUSIONS: Only the tactic of speech 
      reading was closely associated with impaired hearing, with some evidence that 
      females were more inclined to use it. Otherwise, all tactics were commonly 
      employed, regardless of hearing status.

TI  - Effect of methylphenidate on attention in apathetic AD patients in a randomized, 
      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 239-46
LID - 10.1017/S1041610213001762 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the effect of methylphenidate (MPH) on 
      attention in Alzheimer's disease (AD). MPH has shown to improve apathy in AD, and 
      both apathy and attention have been related to dopaminergic function. The goal 
      was to investigate MPH effects on attention in AD and assess the relationship 
      between attention and apathy responses. METHODS: MPH (10 mg PO twice daily) or 
      placebo was administered for six weeks in a randomized, double-blind trial in 
      mild-to-moderate AD outpatients with apathy (Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) 
      Apathy ≥ 4). Attention was measured with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence 
      Scale--Digit Span (DS) subtest (DS forward, selective attention) and apathy with 
      the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). A mixed effects linear regression estimated 
      the difference in change from baseline between treatment groups, defined as δ 
      (MPH (DS week 6-DS baseline)) - (placebo (DS week 6-DS baseline)). RESULTS: In 60 
      patients (37 females, age = 76 ± 8, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) = 20 ± 
      5, NPI Apathy = 7 ± 2), the change in DS forward (δ = 0.87 (95% CI: 0.06-1.68), p 
      = 0.03) and DS total (δ = 1.01 (95% CI: 0.09-1.93), p = 0.03) favored MPH over 
      placebo. Of 57 completers, 17 patients had improved apathy (≥3.3 points on the 
      AES from baseline to end point) and 40 did not. There were no significant 
      associations between AES and NPI Apathy with DS change scores in the MPH, 
      placebo, AES responder, or non-responder groups. DS scores did not predict apathy 
      response to MPH treatment. CONCLUSION: These results suggest MPH can improve 
      attention and apathy in AD; however, the effects appear independent in this 
      population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Technology-based aids for lifestyle change are becoming more 
      prevalent for chronic conditions. Important "digital divides" remain, as well as 
      concerns about privacy, data security, and lack of motivation. Researchers need a 
      way to characterize participants' readiness to use health technologies. To 
      address this need, we created an instrument to measure patient readiness to 
      engage with health technologies among adult patients with chronic conditions. 
      METHODS: Initial focus groups to determine domains, followed by item development 
      and refinement, and exploratory factor analysis to determine final items and 
      factor structure. The development sample included 200 patients with chronic 
      conditions from 6 family medicine clinics. From 98 potential items, 53 best 
      candidate items were examined using exploratory factor analysis. Pearson's 
      Correlation for Test/Retest reliability at 3 months. RESULTS: The final 
      instrument had 28 items that sorted into 8 factors with associated Cronbach's 
      alpha: 1) Health Information Need (0.84), 2) Computer/Internet Experience (0.87), 
      3) Computer Anxiety (0.82), 4) Preferred Mode of Interaction (0.73), 5) 
      Relationship with Doctor (0.65), 6) Cell Phone Expertise (0.75), 7) Internet 
      Privacy (0.71), and 8) No News is Good News (0.57). Test-retest reliability for 
      the 8 subscales ranged from (0.60 to 0.85). CONCLUSION: The Patient Readiness to 
      Engage in Health Internet Technology (PRE-HIT) instrument has good psychometric 
      properties and will be an aid to researchers investigating technology-based 
      health interventions. Future work will examine predictive validity.

TI  - Self-stigma in psychiatric patients--standardization of the ISMI scale.
PG  - 624-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Self-stigma in psychiatric patients is an issue deserving both 
      research and therapeutic attention. The objective of the present study was to 
      evaluate the psychometric properties of a Czech version of the Internalized 
      Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale assessing the levels of self-stigma in 
      individuals with mental disorders. METHODS: It consists of 29 items classified 
      into 5 subscales, namely alienation, stereotype endorsement, perceived 
      discrimination, social withdrawal and stigma resistance. The study group 
      comprised 369 patients with a mean age of 41.5±13.3 years, of whom 210 (56.6%) 
      were females. RESULTS: The most frequent diagnosis was neurotic disorders 
      (46.1%), followed by affective disorders (18.4%), substance use disorders 
      (13.3%), psychotic disorders (10.8%), personality disorders (9.5%) and organic 
      disorders (1.6%). Reliability of the scale was evaluated by internal consistency 
      analysis (α=0.91), the split-half method (Spearman-Brown coefficient: 0.93) and 
      test-retest at 3 weeks from the first measurement (N=17; r=0.90, p<0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: Exploratory factor analysis of the scale was performed, its validity 
      was verified and norms were established that were based on T-scores and sten 
      scores for the entire scale and individual subscales. The Czech translation of 
      the ISMI has adequate psychometric properties.

TI  - [Reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the Apathy Evaluation 
      Scale].
PG  - 445-52
AB  - AIM: Clinicians need an objective scale to measure apathy in patients with 
      dementia. However, different cutoff scores for the Apathy Evaluation Scale 
      Informant version (AES-I), an international apathy scale, have been used in 
      previous studies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cutoff score, 
      reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the AES-I (AES-I-J). METHODS: 
      We acquired the author's permission to translate the AES from English to 
      Japanese. The subjects of this study included 50 patients with dementia living in 
      institutions or the community. The mean (standard deviation; SD) age of the 
      subjects was 82.7 (5.7) years, the mean (SD) educational level was 8.9 (2.7) 
      years and the mean (SD) Mini-Mental State Examination score was 14.8 (8.1). We 
      provided the caregivers with two apathy scales to assess each patient: the 
      AES-I-J (re-test: four weeks later) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory in Nursing 
      Home version apathy score. RESULTS: The mean (SD) score for the AES-I-J was 45.8 
      (16.2). For this test, Cronbach's α was 0.97, and the intraclass correlation 
      coefficient of test-retest was 0.88 (95%CI: 0.72-0.95) (p<0.0001). In addition, 
      the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.90 (95%CI: 
      0.78-1.00) (p<0.0001) and the cut-off score was 45/46, with a sensitivity of 
      89.5% and specificity of 81.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the cutoff 
      score for the AES-I-J is higher than that used in previous reports.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To date, no rating scales for detecting apathy in Parkinson's 
      disease (PD) patients have been validated in Spanish. For this reason, the aim of 
      this study was to validate a Spanish version of Lille apathy rating scale (LARS) 
      in a cohort of PD patients from Spain. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: 130 PD patients 
      and 70 healthy controls were recruited to participate in the study. Apathy was 
      measured using the Spanish version of LARS and the neuropsychiatric inventory 
      (NPI). Reliability (internal consistency, test-retest, and interrater 
      reliability) and validity (construct, content, and criterion validity) were 
      measured. RESULTS: Interrater reliability was 0.93. Cronbach's α for LARS was 
      0.81. The test-retest correlation coefficient was 0.97. The correlation between 
      LARS and NPI scores was 0.61. The optimal cutoff point under the ROC curve was 
      -14, whereas the value derived from healthy controls was -11. The prevalence of 
      apathy in our population tested by LARS was 42%. CONCLUSIONS: The Spanish version 
      of LARS is a reliable and useful tool for diagnosing apathy in PD patients. Total 
      LARS score is influenced by the presence of depression and cognitive impairment. 
      However, both disorders are independent identities with respect to apathy. The 
      satisfactory reliability and validity of the scale make it an appropriate 
      instrument for screening and diagnosing apathy in clinical practice or for 
      research purposes.

TI  - Social adaptive functioning, apathy, and nondysphoric depression among nursing 
      home-dwelling very old adults.
PG  - 319-26
LID - 10.1159/000360823 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathetic and subsyndromal depressive conditions are common in the 
      oldest old. This study examined whether nondysphoric depression (NDD), a clinical 
      condition characterized by ideational and vegetative but no emotional symptoms of 
      depression, belongs to the apathetic presentations of late-life depression. Rates 
      of NDD, dysphoric depression (DD), apathy, and social functional impairment were 
      examined in a sample of nondemented very old (mean age 87.5 years, SD = 7.7) 
      nursing home residents. It was hypothesized that individuals with NDD show 
      greater apathy and greater social functional impairment relative to DD and 
      nondepressed individuals. METHODS: Social functioning was measured using the 
      Social-Adaptive Functioning Evaluation (SAFE) and apathy was measured using the 
      global apathy rating on the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). 
      RESULTS: The rates of DD (50.0%) and NDD (27.4%) were quite high. Participants 
      with DD reported greater apathy than those with NDD (and nondepressed 
      individuals). NDD and DD subjects showed greater social functional impairment 
      relative to the comparison group. There was no difference in social functioning 
      between DD and NDD individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The present data are inconsistent 
      with the view that NDD among the oldest old is an apathetic form of depression. 
      NDD involves social functional impairment. Limitations include rather selected 
      population of nursing home residents that may have included individuals with 
      early dementia, lack of data on prior depressive episodes, and apathy assessment 
      not validated on the specific population.

TI  - A case of atypical progressive supranuclear palsy.
PG  - 31-9
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S51640 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative 
      extrapyramidal syndrome. Studies have demonstrated that PSP can present 
      clinically as an atypical dementing syndrome dominated by a progressive apraxia 
      of speech (AOS) and aphasia. AIM: We aimed to investigate the clinical 
      presentation of PSP, using a comprehensive multidimensional evaluation, and the 
      disease response to various pharmacological treatments. METHODS: A 72-year-old 
      right-handed male, with 17 years education, who first presented with aphasia, 
      AOS, depression, apathy, and postural instability at 69 years; a complete 
      neuropsychological evaluation, tapping the different cognitive domains, was 
      performed. RESULTS: Testing revealed a moderate global cognitive deficit 
      (Mini-Mental State Examination test score =20), low memory test scores (story 
      recall, Rey's 15-word Immediate and Delayed Recall), and poor phonemic and 
      semantic fluency. The patient's language was characterized by AOS, with slow 
      speech rate, prolonged intervals between syllables and words, decreased 
      articulatory accuracy, sound distortions, and anomia. Behavioral changes, such as 
      depression, anxiety, apathy, and irritability, were reported. The neurological 
      examination revealed supranuclear vertical gaze palsy, poor face miming, and a 
      mild balance deficit. Magnetic resonance imaging showed only widespread cortical 
      atrophy. Single photon emission computed tomography demonstrated left > right 
      frontotemporal cortical abnormalities. After 6 months, a further 
      neuropsychological assessment showed a progression in cognitive deficits, with 
      additional attention deficits. The patient reported frequent falls, but the 
      neurological deficits remained unchanged. Neuroimaging tests showed the same 
      brain involvement. CONCLUSION: Our case highlights the heterogeneity of the 
      clinical features in this syndrome, demonstrating that atypical PSP can present 
      as AOS and aphasia, without the classical features or involvement of the 
      subcortical gray and brainstem region, commonly affected in typical PSP.

TI  - Measuring life space in older adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease 
      using mobile phone GPS.
PG  - 154-62
LID - 10.1159/000355669 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As an indicator of physical and cognitive functioning in 
      community-dwelling older adults, there is increasing interest in measuring life 
      space, defined as the geographical area a person covers in daily life. Typically 
      measured through questionnaires, life space can be challenging to assess in 
      amnestic dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). While global 
      positioning system (GPS) technology has been suggested as a potential solution, 
      there remains a lack of data validating GPS-based methods to measure life space 
      in cognitively impaired populations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to 
      evaluate the construct validity of a GPS system to provide quantitative 
      measurements of global movement for individuals with mild-to-moderate AD. 
      METHODS: Nineteen community-dwelling older adults with mild-to-moderate AD 
      (Mini-Mental State Examination score 14-28, age 70.7 ± 2.2 years) and 33 controls 
      (CTL; age 74.0 ± 1.2 years) wore a GPS-enabled mobile phone during the day for 3 
      days. Measures of geographical territory (area, perimeter, mean distance from 
      home, and time away from home) were calculated from the GPS log. Following a 
      log-transformation to produce symmetrical distributions, group differences were 
      tested using two-sample t tests. Construct validity of the GPS measures was 
      tested by examining the correlation between the GPS measures and indicators of 
      physical function [steps/day, gait velocity, and Disability Assessment for 
      Dementia (DAD)] and affective state (Apathy Evaluation Scale and Geriatric 
      Depression Scale). Multivariate regression was performed to evaluate the relative 
      strength of significantly correlated factors. RESULTS: GPS-derived area (p < 
      0.01), perimeter (p < 0.01), and mean distance from home (p < 0.05) were smaller 
      in the AD group compared to CTL. The correlation analysis found significant 
      associations of the GPS measures area and perimeter with all measures of physical 
      function (steps/day, DAD, and gait velocity; p < 0.01), symptoms of apathy (p < 
      0.01), and depression (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis indicated that 
      gait velocity and dependence were the strongest variables associated with GPS 
      measures. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that GPS-derived area and 
      perimeter: (1) distinguished mild-to-moderate AD patients from CTL and (2) were 
      strongly correlated with physical function and affective state. These findings 
      confirm the ability of GPS technology to assess life space behaviour and may be 
      particularly valuable to continuously monitor functional decline associated with 
      neurodegenerative disease, such as AD.

AB  - AIMS: Apathy in the context of treated major depressive disorder (MDD) is a 
      frequently observed phenomenon in clinical practice. This study aimed to assess 
      the validity of the Rothschild Scale for Antidepressant Tachyphylaxis® (RSAT) and 
      the Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning 
      Questionnaire (CPFQ) for measuring apathy, and to assess the relationship between 
      apathy and possible contributing factors, in patients with MDD and residual 
      apathy in the absence of depressed mood. METHODS: The underlying structure and 
      validity of the RSAT and CPFQ were assessed via factor analysis and correlation 
      with the Apathy Evaluation Scale-Clinician rated version (AES-C) in 483 patients 
      who had previously responded to treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitor. The relationship between apathy and contributing variables was 
      investigated via structural equation modeling. Correlation and regression 
      analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between the Sheehan 
      Disability Scale (SDS) and the RSAT, CPFQ, and AES-C. RESULTS: The RSAT and CPFQ 
      were validated with the AES-C with respect to energy and motivation. The latent 
      variable "Energy and Interest", based on the energy, motivation, and interest 
      items (RSAT and CPFQ), was a major contributing factor to apathy. Improvements in 
      function (SDS) were significantly correlated with, and predicted by, improvements 
      in apathy and cognitive and physical functioning (assessed by the RSAT, CPFQ, and 
      AES-C). CONCLUSIONS: These analyses provide further information on apathy and its 
      assessment in the context of treated MDD. A better understanding of apathy will 
      aid further investigation of this phenomenon and, ultimately, determination of 
      the most appropriate approach for its clinical management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anhedonia, or loss of pleasure and/or interest in people or things, 
      is a key component of many forms of psychopathology. Extant anhedonia measures 
      only assess current state or longstanding trait anhedonia, which risks 
      discounting recent changes. Thus, we created the Specific Loss of Interest and 
      Pleasure Scale (SLIPS), to assess recent changes in anhedonia. METHODS: Four 
      studies assessed the reliability and validity of the SLIPS through factor and 
      internal consistency analyses, convergent and divergent validity analyses, and 
      incremental validity analyses in individuals reporting non-clinical and clinical 
      levels of psychopathology. RESULTS: The SLIPS was internally consistent, 
      converged with existing state measures of anhedonia and depression, and diverged 
      from general measures of affect and trait anticipatory and consummatory pleasure. 
      Furthermore, the SLIPS predicted recent changes in anhedonia independent of 
      existing measures. Moreover, in respondents reporting moderate or severe symptoms 
      of depression, only the SLIPS was associated with recent changes in anhedonia. 
      LIMITATIONS: Prospective limitations included a resulting one factor solution and 
      the potential that the method of scaling influenced results. However, these 
      limitations were offset by empirical verification and the unique strength of the 
      scaling of the SLIPS. CONCLUSIONS: The SLIPS is the first validated measure that 
      allows for the assessment of recent changes in anhedonia in non-clinical and 
      clinical samples. Results suggest that the SLIPS offers unique clinical utility 
      by discriminating changes in anhedonia within at-risk and clinically depressed 
      groups.

      disturbances.
PG  - 77-84
LID - 10.1002/gps.3972 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Individuals suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) often have 
      impaired awareness or a lack of insight into their cognitive deficits and 
      functional abilities, especially in the later stages of the disease. Previous 
      research has documented a relationship between depression and insight in AD, such 
      that greater awareness of one's disease has been associated with a higher degree 
      of depression. However, little is known about the relationship between insight, 
      cognitive decline, and other psychiatric or behavioral problems associated with 
      AD. METHODS: This study included 107 outpatients who met criteria for probable 
      AD. Instruments included the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale, the Apathy Evaluation 
      Scale, and the mini mental state exam. A series of hierarchical regression 
      analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between insight and 
      depressed mood, anxiety, psychosis, apathy, agitation, and behavioral retardation 
      in AD patients after controlling for cognitive skills. RESULTS: Insight was found 
      to significantly predict depressed mood, anxiety, and apathy even after 
      controlling for global cognition. Greater insight was found to be associated with 
      depressed mood and anxiety. However, impaired insight was associated with higher 
      levels of apathy. CONCLUSION: Insight may be differentially related to mood 
      symptoms and apathy within AD, such that patients with intact insight are more 
      depressed, whereas patients with impaired insight are more apathetic. This 
      suggests that assessment of insight in AD may complement the clinical evaluation 
      of depression and apathy in AD and help guide the most appropriate interventions.

TI  - Assessing apathy in everyday clinical practice with the short-form Lille Apathy 
      Rating Scale.
PG  - 2014-9
LID - 10.1002/mds.25584 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is an invalidating behavioral disorder that must always be 
      screened for and assessed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The Lille 
      Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) has been validated in several different contexts, but 
      the lengthy administration time means that it is mostly recommended for research 
      use. The aim of the present study was to validate a short form of the LARS for 
      use in everyday practice. METHODS: In total, 416 patients with PD and 56 healthy 
      controls participated in the study. Apathy, depression, motor symptoms, and 
      overall cognitive efficiency were assessed. The most discriminant items of the 
      LARS for apathy detection were selected using multiple indicators. RESULTS: A 
      subset of 12 items (constituting the short-form LARS) showed the best 
      convergence. Concurrent and criterion-related validity, internal consistency, 
      test-retest reliability, and inter-rater reliability were very good. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The short-form LARS is a reliable, practical, patient interview-based instrument 
      for assessing apathy in everyday clinical practice.

TI  - [Diagnostic mistakes in post-traumatic stress disorder. The problem of symptom 
      overlap with depression].
PG  - 1051-63
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The overlap between symptoms of PTSD and MDD is substantial. PTSD 
      symptoms arise after a traumatic experience and the trauma is present in all of 
      the diagnostic clusters. In individuals who have experienced a trauma a long time 
      before, it is difficult to establish the exact moment of onset of their symptoms 
      in relation to the trauma suffered. We proposed to raise awareness among 
      operators who may encounter this problem, with the aim of providing them with 
      valuable help in order to achieve a correct differential diagnosis. METHODS: A 
      sample of subjects suffering from PTSD without comorbidity was assessed to 
      confirm the diagnosis and the severity of post-traumatic symptoms. The 
      Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare any modifications in the parameters 
      analyzed through the Davidson Trauma Scale with the presence and severity of 
      depressive symptoms as evaluated by the Hamilton-D scale. RESULTS: Half of the 
      PSTD patients recruited showed values of HAM-D > 18, although an active Major 
      Depressive Episode was clinically excluded. Symptom of "numbing", despite being 
      different from the apathy experienced in depression, is identified as a 
      depressive symptom by the HAM-D. CONCLUSIONS: Giving prevalence to depressive

TI  - Apathy is more severe in vascular than amnestic mild cognitive impairment in a 
      community: the Kurihara Project.
PG  - 517-25

AB  - AIM:  The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of apathy, and to 
      compare vascular mild cognitive impairment (vMCI), amnestic MCI (amMCI), and 
      other type using Clinical Assessment for Spontaneity (CAS). METHODS:  Agreement 
      to take part in the study was obtained from 590 community dwellers, aged 
      ≥75 years living in Kurihara, Japan. Of the 590 subjects, 221 had a clinical 
      dementia rating (CDR) of 0 (normal); 295 had CDR 0.5 (mild cognitive impairment; 
      MCI); and 74 had CDR 1+ (dementia). The CDR 0.5 subjects were divided into three 
      groups: 55 with vMCI (Erkinjuntti et al. criteria), 91 with amMCI and 149 with 
      other type. To evaluate the various aspects of apathy, we used the three CAS 
      subscales: clinical interview (CAS1), self-evaluation (CAS2), and caregiver 
      assessment (CAS3). Three analyses were then performed to determine: (i) the 
      validity of CAS; (ii) the prevalence rate of apathy in CDR 0 versus CDR 0.5 
      versus CDR 1+; and (iii) the prevalence rate of apathy in normal versus vMCI 
      versus amMCI versus other type. RESULTS:  CAS was validated with the Apathy 
      Evaluation Scale. There were significant differences among the three CDR groups 
      in CAS1, CAS2 and CAS3 (P < 0.001). The prevalence rate of apathy in each CAS in 
      the CDR 1+ group was higher than the CDR 0.5 group, which was higher than the CDR 
      0 group. There was a significant difference in CAS3 score between the four groups 
      (the normal and the three subgroups; P < 0.001). Apathy in vMCI was more severe 
      than in the other three groups (P < 0.05) on CAS3 score. CONCLUSIONS:  vMCI 
      subjects have more severe apathy compared with amMCI subjects on caregiver 
      assessment.

TI  - Trajectories of individual symptoms in remitters versus non-remitters with 
      depression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It remains unclear regarding the contribution of each individual 
      symptom in predicting the outcome in major depressive disorder (MDD). The 
      objective of this analysis was to evaluate trajectories of individual symptoms 
      over time to identify which specific depressive item(s) could predict subsequent 
      clinical response. METHODS: The data of 2874 outpatients with nonpsychotic MDD 
      who received citalopram for up to 14 weeks in the Sequenced Treatment 
      Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial were analyzed. Average 
      trajectories of individual symptoms over time were estimated for remitters and 
      non-remitters. Moreover, specific symptoms whose improvement at week 2 predicted 
      remission were identified, using binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 
      Trajectories were significantly different between remitters and non-remitters in 
      all depressive symptoms. All depressive symptoms in the 16-item Quick Inventory 
      of Depressive Symptomatology, Self-Report (QIDS-SR16) in the two groups, except 
      for hypersomnia and weight change in non-remitters, substantially improved within 
      2 weeks and gradually continued to improve thereafter throughout the 14 weeks. 
      Early improvements in the following five symptoms, in order of magnitude, in the 
      QIDS-SR16 were significantly associated with remission: sad mood, negative 
      self-view, feeling slowed down, low energy, and restlessness (P<0.001, P<0.001, 
      P=0.001, P=0.004, P=0.021). LIMITATIONS: The participants were limited to the 
      nonpsychotic MDD outpatients who received citalopram. Further, symptomatology was 
      not evaluated at the very beginning of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: While the data 
      pertain to citalopram and replication is necessary for other antidepressants, 
      early improvements in certain core depressive symptoms may serve as a predictor 
      of subsequent remission.

TI  - The head and neck symptom checklist©: an instrument to evaluate nutrition impact 
      symptoms effect on energy intake and weight loss.
PG  - 3127-36
LID - 10.1007/s00520-013-1870-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to validate the Head and Neck Patient Symptom 
      Checklist(©) (HNSC(©)) by tracing the prevalence and interference with eating of 
      nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) over time and by examining relationships among 
      NIS included in the HNSC, energy intake, and weight loss. METHODS: Height, 
      weight, 3-day diet records, and HNSC(©) were obtained at baseline, posttreatment, 
      and 2.5 month follow-up for 52 treatment-naive head and neck cancer (HNC) 
      patients. Relationships among energy intake, weight loss, age, sex, treatment, 
      tumor stage, and NIS were evaluated using general estimating equation (GEE) 
      modeling. Cumulative hazard (CH) analysis was used to determine the time and risk 
      of weight loss. RESULTS: From baseline to posttreatment, 71 % of patients had 5 % 
      body weight loss. Despite energy intakes returning to baseline levels at 
      follow-up, 88 % of patients continued to lose weight. At posttreatment, 100 % of 
      patients reported 2 or more NIS (range 2-12); these symptoms were still present 
      at follow-up in 83 % of the patients. Univariate GEE analysis demonstrated that 
      most NIS predicted energy intake and weight loss, while multivariate GEE analysis 
      showed that depression, dysphagia, and sore mouth predicted energy intake, and 
      dysphagia and sore mouth predicted weight loss. CH analysis showed that NIS 
      accelerated the time and probability of weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: The HNSC(©) is 
      a valid tool for assessing NIS in HNC. Identification of NIS may aid in the 
      management of symptoms associated with reduced energy intake and weight loss and 
      thus decrease the malnutrition risk in HNC patients.

TI  - Nonmotor symptoms in nursing home residents with Parkinson's disease: prevalence 
      and effect on quality of life.
PG  - 1714-21
LID - 10.1111/jgs.12458 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of nonmotor symptoms (NMS) in nursing 
      home (NH) residents with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to establish the 
      association with quality of life. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Nursing homes 
      in the southeast of the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents with PD 
      and a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 18 or greater (N = 73; mean age 
      78.7, disease duration 10 years, mainly Hoehn and Yahr Stages 4 (38%) and 5 
      (49%)) underwent detailed examination to determine the prevalence of NMS. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Validated instruments for PD-related NMS were used to examine the 
      NH residents with PD. The overall burden of NMS, and autonomic problems in 
      particular, were measured using the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS). Depression, 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms, sleep problems, cognitive dysfunction, and motor 
      impairments were focused on in further detail using established clinimetric 
      tests. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between 
      these symptoms and quality of life, which was measured using the Parkinson's 
      Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8). RESULTS: The NMSS revealed a mean of nearly 13 
      different NMS per resident. Autonomic problems (constipation, urinary urgency) 
      were particularly prevalent (48-75% of residents). Depressive symptoms were 
      present in 45%. The most prevalent neuropsychiatric symptoms other than 
      depression were irritability and apathy. The most common sleep problems were 
      overall poor nighttime sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and nocturia. Cognitive 
      problems were highly prevalent, and 77% of the residents met the criteria for 
      PD-related dementia. High scores were also obtained for motor impairments. Mean 
      PDQ-8 score was high, indicating poor quality of life. Poor quality of life was 
      most strongly associated with the prevalence and severity of overall NMS burden 
      (coefficient of determination = 0.45). CONCLUSION: Nonmotor symptoms were highly 
      prevalent in NH residents with PD. Quality of life was poor, largely because of 
      NMS. Because many NMS are potentially treatable, diagnosis and treatment of these 
      severely affected individuals deserve more attention.

TI  - Salience network resting-state activity: prediction of frontotemporal dementia 
      progression.
PG  - 1249-53
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Noninvasive measures of activity within intrinsic brain networks may 
      be clinically relevant, providing a marker of neurodegenerative disease and 
      predicting clinical behaviors. OBJECTIVE: To correlate baseline resting-state 
      measures within the salience network and changes in behavior among patients with 
      frontotemporal dementia. DESIGN: Baseline resting-state functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging data and longitudinal clinical measures were obtained from 
      prospectively accrued patients during 8 weeks. SETTING: Tertiary academic care 
      center specializing in the assessment and management of patients with 
      neurodegenerative disease. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen patients with clinically 
      diagnosed frontotemporal dementia (5 behavioral variant and 10 semantic 
      dementia). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Baseline resting-state functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging data measured within regions of interest were regressed on 
      serial behavioral measures from prospectively accrued patients with 
      frontotemporal dementia to determine the ability of baseline resting-state 
      activity to account for changes in behavior. RESULTS: Low-frequency fluctuations 
      in the left insula significantly predicted changes in Frontal Behavioral 
      Inventory scores (standard β = 0.51, P = .049), accounting for 28% of the change 
      variance. The trend was driven by changes in measures of apathy independent of 
      dementia severity. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Baseline measures of salience 
      network connectivity involving the left insula may predict behavioral changes in 
      patients with frontotemporal dementia.

AB  - The Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) is a 46-item questionnaire that 
      measures behaviors associated with frontal subcortical deficits (apathy, 
      disinhibition, and executive dysfunction) in adult neurologic populations. Based 
      on findings from a previous exploratory factor analysis on the scale, the current 
      study used confirmatory factor analysis to explore and potentially improve on the 
      measurement model fit of current FrSBe scores. Model fit indices and 
      reliabilities (measured using internal consistency reliability) were compared in 
      the original and in several alternative models. The original scale demonstrated a 
      generally good fitting model, although the best fitting model (referred to as the 
      reduced model) removed eight items from the original measure and modestly 
      improved model fit over the original FrSBe. Strong reliability was found in both 
      versions. Results from the current study provide a critical first step in a 
      potential FrSBe scale revision.

TI  - To what extent do single symptoms from a depression rating scale predict risk of 
      long-term sickness absence among employees who are free of clinical depression?
PG  - 735-9
LID - 10.1007/s00420-012-0797-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Depression rating scales have predicted long-term sickness absence 
      (LTSA) in previous studies. With this study, we investigated to what extent 
      single symptoms from a depression rating scale predicted LTSA among employees who 
      were free of clinical depression. METHODS: We studied 6,670 female employees in 
      the Danish eldercare sector. Frequency of 12 depressive symptoms over the last 2 
      weeks was assessed with the Major Depression Inventory. A symptom was considered 
      as elevated if it was present at least "slightly more than half of the time." 
      Data were linked to a national register on LTSA (≥3 weeks). We calculated hazard 
      ratios (HR) from Cox's proportional hazard models to analyze whether a symptom 
      predicted time to onset of LTSA during a 1-year follow-up. Analyses were adjusted 
      for age, family status, health behaviors, occupational group, and previous LTSA. 
      RESULTS: Of the 12 symptoms, three predicted LTSA after adjustment for 
      covariates: "felt low in spirits and sad" (HR = 1.41, 95 % CI = 1.05-1.89), "felt 
      lacking in energy and strength" (HR = 1.33, 95 % CI = 1.08-1.64), and "had 
      trouble sleeping at night" (HR = 1.38, 95 % CI = 1.09-1.74). CONCLUSION: Among 
      female eldercare workers free of clinical depression, feelings of low spirits and 
      sadness, feelings of lack of energy and strength, and sleep disturbances predict 
      risk of LTSA. Interventions that decrease the prevalence of these symptoms might 
      contribute to a reduction in LTSA in this population.

      Inpatients (GIP)].
PG  - 166-74
LID - 10.1007/s12439-013-0035-3 [doi]
AB  - The Behavioural Rating Scale for Geriatric Inpatients (GIP) consists of fourteen, 
      Rasch modelled subscales, each measuring different aspects of behavioural, 
      cognitive and affective disturbances in elderly patients. Four additional 
      measures are derived from the GIP: care dependency, apathy, cognition and affect. 
      The objective of the study was to determine the reproducibility of the 18 
      measures. A convenience sample of 56 patients in psychogeriatric day care was 
      assessed twice by the same observer (a professional caregiver). The median time 
      interval between rating occasions was 45 days (interquartile range 34-58 days). 
      Reproducibility was determined by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients 
      (ICC agreement) for test-retest reliability. The minimal detectable difference 
      (MDD) was calculated based on the standard error of measurement (SEM agreement). 
      Test-retest reliability expressed by the ICCs varied from 0.57 (incoherent 
      behaviour) to 0.93 (anxious behaviour). Standard errors of measurement varied 
      from 0.28 (anxious behaviour) to 1.63 (care dependency). The results show how the 
      GIP can be applied when interpreting individual change in psychogeriatric day 
      care participants.

TI  - The Brazilian version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician rating scale 
      (NPI-C): reliability and validity in dementia.
PG  - 1503-11
LID - 10.1017/S1041610213000811 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with dementia may be unable to describe their symptoms, and 
      caregivers frequently suffer emotional burden that can interfere with judgment of 
      the patient's behavior. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician rating scale 
      (NPI-C) was therefore developed as a comprehensive and versatile instrument to 
      assess and accurately measure neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in dementia, 
      thereby using information from caregiver and patient interviews, and any other 
      relevant available data. The present study is a follow-up to the original, 
      cross-national NPI-C validation, evaluating the reliability and concurrent 
      validity of the NPI-C in quantifying psychopathological symptoms in dementia in a 
      large Brazilian cohort. METHODS: Two blinded raters evaluated 312 participants 
      (156 patient-knowledgeable informant dyads) using the NPI-C for a total of 624 
      observations in five Brazilian centers. Inter-rater reliability was determined 
      through intraclass correlation coefficients for the NPI-C domains and the 
      traditional NPI. Convergent validity included correlations of specific domains of 
      the NPI-C with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Cohen-Mansfield 
      Agitation Index (CMAI), the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), and 
      the Apathy Inventory (AI). RESULTS: Inter-rater reliability was strong for all 
      NPI-C domains. There were high correlations between NPI-C/delusions and BPRS, 
      NPI-C/apathy-indifference with the AI, NPI-C/depression-dysphoria with the CSDD, 
      NPI-C/agitation with the CMAI, and NPI-C/aggression with the CMAI. There was 
      moderate correlation between the NPI-C/aberrant vocalizations and CMAI and the 
      NPI-C/hallucinations with the BPRS. CONCLUSION: The NPI-C is a comprehensive tool 
      that provides accurate measurement of NPS in dementia with high concurrent 
      validity and inter-rater reliability in the Brazilian setting. In addition to 
      universal assessment, the NPI-C can be completed by individual domains.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a frequent neuropsychiatric condition in neurodegenerative 
      disorders, depression, and often in mild cognitive impairment. The Apathy 
      Inventory (AI) is a reliable instrument for improving the accuracy of the apathy 
      diagnosis. The aim was to establish the validity of the Apathy Inventory for the 
      Brazilian community. METHODS: We established the concurrent validity, internal 
      consistency, inter-rater reliability, and the sensitivity and specificity of AI 
      for the Brazilian community in a cohort of 175 individuals with Alzheimer's 
      disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy 
      controls. The three dimensions of the AI (emotional blunting, lack of initiative, 
      and lack of interest) were compared with the Apathy domain of the 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician rating scale (NPI-C) in an independent 
      scheme. RESULTS: The analyses demonstrated high correlation coefficients in AI's 
      individual dimensions and in AI-total score (F = 0.965). Concerning the 
      NPI-C/Apathy domain, intra-class correlation coefficients were also high 
      (F = 0.977). Concurrent validity was high according to both raters on AI 
      dimensions × NPI-C/Apathy domain and regarding total score (rater 1: rho = 0.956 
      vs. rater 2: rho = 0.970). The internal consistency of the AI was also high 
      concerning the AI's individual dimensions and total score (rater 1: 0.945 vs. 
      rater 2: 0.958). CONCLUSION: We observed high internal consistency, high 
      concurrent validity, and inter-rater reliability of the Apathy Inventory. In 
      addition, we found that its sensitivity and specificity were high. We suggest 
      that the Brazilian version of the Apathy Inventory would be an appropriate 
      instrument to identify the apathy syndrome in Brazilian patients.

AB  - The field of therapeutics in schizophrenia is redefining optimal outcome, moving 
      beyond clinical remission to a more comprehensive model that also includes 
      functional recovery. The Quality of Life Scale (QLS) has been adopted by many 
      large clinical trials, including CATIE and CUtLASS, as a measure of functioning. 
      The QLS is a 21-item semi-structured interview that takes approximately 45min to 
      administer. Although the QLS is considered comprehensive, its length limits its 
      applicability across studies. To circumvent this issue, short scales of the QLS 
      have been created that estimate total scores with high accuracy. However, these 
      abbreviated measures have not been adequately cross-validated in a large enough 
      sample to allow for subsample estimations nor has its predictive ability been 
      compared to the full scale. Here, we used data from the CATIE trial (n=1460) to 
      demonstrate the validity and utility of an abbreviated 7-item QLS. The shortened 
      QLS was robust in estimating total scores (r=0.953, p<0.001) across subsamples 
      and demonstrated predictive ability similar to the full QLS in multiple 
      regression models. The abridged QLS is recommended as a surrogate measure of

TI  - Safety and efficacy of methylphenidate for apathy in Alzheimer's disease: a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 810-6
LID - 10.4088/JCP.12m08099 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In a recent crossover trial, methylphenidate treatment decreased 
      apathy in Alzheimer's disease. We further assessed this finding in the Apathy in 
      Dementia Methylphenidate Trial (ADMET). METHOD: Six-week, randomized, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial enrolling Alzheimer's disease 
      participants (NINCDS-ADRDA criteria) with apathy assigned to methylphenidate 20 
      mg daily or placebo, conducted from June 2010 to December 2011. Primary outcomes 
      were change in Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) score and modified Alzheimer's 
      Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGI-C). 
      Secondary outcomes included change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) apathy 
      score, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, and safety. RESULTS: 60 
      participants were randomly assigned (29 methylphenidate, 31 placebo). At 
      baseline, mean (SD) age = 76 (8) years, MMSE score = 20 (5), AES score = 51 (12), 
      NPI total score = 16 (8), and 62% of the participants (n = 37) were female. After 
      6 weeks' treatment, mean (SD) change in AES score was -1.9 (1.5) for 
      methylphenidate and 0.6 (1.4) for placebo (P = .23). Odds ratio for improvement 
      in ADCS-CGI-C was 3.7 (95% CI, 1.3 to 10.8) (P = .02), with 21% of 
      methylphenidate versus 3% of placebo rated as moderately or markedly improved. 
      NPI apathy score improvement was 1.8 points (95% CI, 0.3 to 3.4) greater on 
      methylphenidate than on placebo (P = .02). MMSE trended toward improvement on 
      methylphenidate (P = .06). There were trends toward greater anxiety and weight 
      loss > 2% in the methylphenidate-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Methylphenidate 
      treatment of apathy in Alzheimer's disease was associated with significant 
      improvement in 2 of 3 efficacy outcomes and a trend toward improved global 
      cognition with minimal adverse events, supporting the safety and efficacy of 
      methylphenidate treatment for apathy in Alzheimer's disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Development of an oral assessment tool to evaluate appetite in patients with head 
      and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy.

LID - S1462-3889(12)00104-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ejon.2012.10.010 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to develop an oral assessment tool for 
      evaluating the appetite of patients with head and neck cancer receiving 
      radiotherapy, who had dysgeusia, xerostomia, and oral mucositis, as well as to 
      verify its validity and reliability. METHODS AND SAMPLE: A draft oral assessment 
      tool, which included a 5-point scale and 19 items, was prepared based on an 
      interview survey of 30 patients. The resultant questionnaire survey was provided 
      to 209 subjects. RESULTS: On the basis of factor analysis of construct validity, 
      3 factors (dysgeusia and loss of favors), (salivation abnormality and loss of 
      moisture in the oral cavity), and (pain in the oral cavity and lack of 
      motivation) comprising 14 items were adopted for the final survey. During a 
      review of criteria validity, a correlation was found between the scores of the 
      three factors and overall oral assessment tool, and the scores of taste 
      sensitivity, xerostomia, oral mucositis, and appetite with a correlation 
      coefficient of r = 0.41-0.89 (p < 0.01). With regard to reliability, stability 
      was determined as 0.87 (p < 0.01) according to test-retest study results. 
      Internal consistency was confirmed by a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.83 
      (p < 0.01) and an interclass correlation coefficient of 0.80 (p < 0.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the validity and reliability of the oral assessment 
      tool developed, it has been found to be practical for use in the assessment of 
      appetite of patients with head and neck cancer.

TI  - Assessment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia: toward improving accuracy.
PG  - 244-251
LID - 10.1590/S1980-57642013DN70300003 [doi]
AB  - The issue of this article concerned the discussion about tools frequently used 
      tools for assessing neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients with dementia, 
      particularly Alzheimer's disease. The aims were to discuss the main tools for 
      evaluating behavioral disturbances, and particularly the accuracy of the 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Clinician Rating Scale (NPI-C). The clinical 
      approach to and diagnosis of neuropsychiatric syndromes in dementia require 
      suitable accuracy. Advances in the recognition and early accurate diagnosis of 
      psychopathological symptoms help guide appropriate pharmacological and 
      non-pharmacological interventions. In addition, recommended standardized and 
      validated measurements contribute to both scientific research and clinical 
      practice. Emotional distress, caregiver burden, and cognitive impairment often 
      experienced by elderly caregivers, may affect the quality of caregiver reports. 
      The clinician rating approach helps attenuate these misinterpretations. In this 
      scenario, the NPI-C is a promising and versatile tool for assessing 
      neuropsychiatric syndromes in dementia, offering good accuracy and high 
      reliability, mainly based on the diagnostic impression of the clinician. This 
      tool can provide both strategies: a comprehensive assessment of neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms in dementia or the investigation of specific psychopathological 
      syndromes such as agitation, depression, anxiety, apathy, sleep disorders, and 
      aberrant motor disorders, among others.

TI  - Predictors of phenotypic progression and disease onset in premanifest and 
      early-stage Huntington's disease in the TRACK-HD study: analysis of 36-month 
      observational data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: TRACK-HD is a multinational prospective observational study of 
      Huntington's disease (HD) that examines clinical and biological findings of 
      disease progression in individuals with premanifest HD (preHD) and early-stage 
      HD. We aimed to describe phenotypic changes in these participants over 36 months 
      and identify baseline predictors of progression. METHODS: Individuals without HD 
      but carrying the mutant huntingtin gene (classed as preHD-A if ≥10·8 years and 
      preHD-B if <10·8 years from predicted onset), participants with early HD (classed 
      as HD1 if they had a total functional capacity score of 11-13 and HD2 if they had 
      a score of 7-10), and healthy control individuals were assessed at four study 
      sites in the Netherlands, the UK, France, and Canada. We measured 36-month change 
      for 3T MRI, clinical, cognitive, quantitative motor, and neuropsychiatric 
      assessments and examined their prognostic value. We also assessed the relation 
      between disease progression and the combined effect of CAG repeat length and age. 
      All participants were analysed according to their baseline subgroups. 
      Longitudinal results were analysed using a combination of repeated-measure 
      weighted least squares models and, when examining risk of new diagnosis, survival 
      analysis. FINDINGS: At baseline, 366 participants were enrolled between Jan 17, 
      and Aug 26, 2008, and of these 298 completed 36-month follow-up: 97 controls, 58 
      participants with preHD-A, 46 with preHD-B, 66 with HD1, and 31 with HD2. In the 
      preHD-B group, several quantitative motor and cognitive tasks showed 
      significantly increased rates of decline at 36 months, compared with controls, 
      whereas few had at 24 months. Of the cognitive measures, the symbol digit 
      modality test was especially sensitive (adjusted mean loss 4·11 points [95% CI 
      1·49-6·73] greater than controls; p=0·003). Among psychiatric indicators, apathy 
      ratings specifically showed significant increases (0·34 points [95% CI 0·02-0·66] 
      greater than controls; p=0·038). There was little evidence of reliable change in 
      non-imaging measures in the preHD-A group, with the exception of the speeded 
      tapping inter-tap interval (0·01 s [95% CI 0·01-0·02] longer than controls; 
      p=0·0001). Several baseline imaging, quantitative motor, and cognitive measures 
      had prognostic value, independent of age and CAG repeat length, for predicting 
      subsequent clinical diagnosis in preHD. Of these, grey-matter volume and 
      inter-tap interval were particularly sensitive (p=0·013 and 0·002, respectively). 
      Longitudinal change in these two measures was also greater in participants with 
      preHD who received a diagnosis of HD during the study compared with those who did 
      not, after controlling for CAG repeat length and age-related risk (p=0·006 and 
      0·0003, respectively). In early HD, imaging, quantitative motor, and cognitive 
      measures were predictive of decline in total functional capacity and tracked 
      longitudinal change; also, neuropsychiatric changes consistent with 
      frontostriatal pathological abnormalities were associated with this loss of 
      functional capacity (problem behaviours assessment composite behaviour score 
      p<0·0001). Age and CAG repeat length explained variance in longitudinal change of 
      multimodal measures, with the effect more prominent in preHD. INTERPRETATION: We 
      have shown changes in several outcome measures in individuals with preHD over 36 
      months. These findings further our understanding of HD progression and have 
      implications for clinical trial design. FUNDING: CHDI Foundation.

AB  - Decision-making and apathy have common neuropsychological processes and 
      neuroanatomical substrates. However, their links in mild cognitive impairment 
      (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: in 
      order to evaluate these links, we compared 3 groups of 20 control subjects to 20 
      patients with MCI and 20 patients with mild AD. All participants completed the 
      mini mental state examination (MMSE), the Lille apathy rating scale (LARS, a 
      multidimensional scale of apathy), the game of dice task (GDT, assessing decision 
      under risk) and the Iowa gambling task (IGT, assessing decision under ambiguity). 
      RESULTS: 60% of patients in both clinical groups were apathetic versus 5% of 
      control subjects. In both clinical groups the IGT and GDT net scores were 
      comparable (respectively: p = 0.76 and p = 0.84), while the control group had 
      higher scores than MCI and AD's groups (respectively, GDT p < 0.02 and p < 0.05; 
      IGT: p < 0.05 and p < 0.05). Cognitive impairment increased the risk of 
      disadvantageous choices in decision under risk (× 6), and under ambiguity (× 
      3.5). No global contribution of apathy was found for decision-making performances 
      (all PS > 0.05), but on the LARS, the "intellectual curiosity" (cognitive 
      dimension) was a predictor for the performances on GDT's (OR = 1.73, p = 0.05), 
      while the "action initiation" (behavioral dimension) was a predictor of those on 
      IGT (OR = 1.57, p = 0.05). DISCUSSION: these results highlight the behavioral and 
      the cognitive sensitivity of the IGT and the GDT, and are analyzed according to 
      Levy and Dubois's model of apathy, and to the three steps of the decision-making 
      process of Gleichgerrcht et al. (2010). However, more researches are necessary to 
      explain the causality links between action initiation and decision under 
      ambiguity.

      Parkinson's disease without dementia and depression].
PG  - 197-207
LID - 10.1684/pnv.2013.0404 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to assess the role of demotivation and various affective factors in 
      apathy in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) without dementia and depression. 
      SUBJECTS: 20 patients and 20 control subjects matched with age, education level, 
      and genre. METHODS: apathy was assessed by the Apathy evaluation scale (AES) and 
      by a specific scale including a quantitative evaluation of 32 intentional 
      activities and a qualitative assessment of the causes of attribution of 
      restricted activities by a semi-structured interview (GDAS). Four causal 
      attributions were distinguished: E = related to external factors, M = disease 
      symptoms related, C = affective disturbances with preservation of motivation, and 
      D = demotivation. The results were compared to a battery of tests including 
      cognitive evaluation (mini-mental state and Mattis dementia rating scale for 
      global evaluation, selecting reminding test for memory; Stroop test for 
      inhibition, and six element test for planification); affective evaluation 
      (Montgomery & Asberg and Hamilton depression rating scales for depression, 
      emotional disturbances by the Abrams and Taylor scale, the Depression mood scale, 
      and the International picture system), premorbid personality (NEOPI-R), and 
      defensive psychological mechanisms (DSQ-40); functional assessment by a combined 
      scale including the Self-maintenance physical scale and the Instrumental 
      activities of daily living (Lawton) and the Social activities scale (Katz & 
      Lyerly), the Disability assessment scale, and the UPDRS. RESULTS: apathy was 
      found in 25% of the patients according to the AES, but only in 15% according to 
      the GDAS. Scores on cognitive and affective evaluation were higher in patients 
      than in controls but only emotional blunting was correlated to apathy. Some 
      results coud be interpreted in favor of a premorbid personality disorder in 
      patients with PD, but were not correlated to apathy. Causal attribution was M in 
      38% of cases of reduced activities, D in 30%, E in 22%, and C in 10%. CONCLUSION: 
      emotional blunting was the main correlate of apathy in PD patients without 
      dementia and depression. Demotivation was the causal mechanism in only 30% of the 
      patients with apathy.

TI  - Fatigue after myocardial infarction - a two-year follow-up study.
PG  - 1647-52
LID - 10.1111/jocn.12114 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate changes in self-reported fatigue and 
      depression from four months to two years following a myocardial infarction, as 
      well as to explore gender differences, identify the incidence of fatigue without 
      coexisting depression and finally predict health-related quality of life at a 
      two-year follow-up. BACKGROUND: Depression and fatigue are associated with 
      decreased health-related quality of life after myocardial infarction. Although 
      there is a close relationship between fatigue and depression, it has been shown 
      that symptoms of fatigue can occur without coexisting depression. DESIGN: 
      Quantitative and longitudinal design. METHODS: Participants (n = 155) were asked 
      to complete the following questionnaires: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
      Scale, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 (MFI-20) and the Short Form 
      Survey (SF-36) following myocardial infarction (after four months and two years). 
      Descriptive statistics, paired t-tests and multiple regressions were carried out. 
      RESULTS: In the entire group, self-reported fatigue had decreased from four 
      months to two years after myocardial infarction. After two years, 18% of 
      respondents reported depression together with fatigue and 30% reported fatigued 
      without depression. Women scored higher than men on the fatigue dimensions 
      reduced activity, reduced motivation and mental fatigue. Moreover, the physical 
      dimension of health-related quality of life two years after myocardial infarction 
      was predicted by experienced general fatigue at four months. CONCLUSION: Fatigue 
      with or without coexisting possible/probable depression remains as a significant 
      symptom two years after myocardial infarction in nearly half of the entire group. 
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Fatigue is a problem following myocardial 
      infarction. Therefore, systematic screening and early identification of patients 
      experiencing symptoms of depression and fatigue after myocardial infarction are 
      important for suitable care planning. In contemporary coronary care, strategies 
      aimed at relieving fatigue should be developed.

TI  - Depression, anxiety and positive affect in people diagnosed with low-grade 
      tumours: the role of illness perceptions.
PG  - 1421-7
LID - 10.1002/pon.3158 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: People with low-grade brain tumour experience a range of emotional, 
      behavioural and psychosocial consequences. Using Leventhal's self-regulation 
      model to explore biopsychosocial factors associated with distress, we examine the 
      relationships between illness perceptions, coping and depression, anxiety and 
      positive affect. METHODS: A cross-sectional, self-report study in which 74 people 
      (54% women) diagnosed with a low-grade brain tumour completed the Illness 
      Perceptions Questionnaire-Revised was conducted. Mean time since diagnosis was 
      27.69 months (SD = 19.79). Mean age was 38.30 years (SD = 10.67). The Illness 
      Perceptions Questionnaire-Revised, in addition to clinical, demographic and 
      coping variables previously associated with psychological distress, was used to 
      predict three psychological outcomes: depression, anxiety and positive affect. 
      RESULTS: Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that a 
      biopsychosocial causal attribution was a significant predictor of anxiety and 
      depression. Illness identity also emerged as a significant predictor of 
      depression scores. Coping through self-blame was the only coping variable to 
      emerge as a significant predictor of anxiety scores. A combination of coping 
      through venting, acceptance, positive reframing, denial, behavioural 
      disengagement and self-blame contributed to the variance in all three 
      psychological outcome scores. No illness perception variables significantly 
      predicted positive affect. CONCLUSIONS: Illness perceptions play a significant 
      role in emotional distress experienced by people with low-grade brain tumours. 
      Illness perceptions did not play a significant role in positive affect. Coping 
      variables were shown to significantly contribute to the scores on all three 
      psychological outcomes. Results suggest interventions targeted at modifying 
      illness perceptions and enhancing problem-focused coping strategies may reduce 
      psychological distress.

LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e318293e368 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the interrater reliability of the new International 
      Behavioural Variant FTD Criteria Consortium (FTDC) criteria for behavioral 
      variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). METHODS: Twenty standardized clinical 
      case modules were developed for patients with a range of neurodegenerative 
      diagnoses, including bvFTD, primary progressive aphasia (nonfluent, semantic, and 
      logopenic variant), Alzheimer disease, and Lewy body dementia. Eighteen blinded 
      raters reviewed the modules and 1) rated the presence or absence of core 
      diagnostic features for the FTDC criteria, and 2) provided an overall diagnostic 
      rating. Interrater reliability was determined by κ statistics for multiple raters 
      with categorical ratings. RESULTS: The mean κ value for diagnostic agreement was 
      0.81 for possible bvFTD and 0.82 for probable bvFTD ("almost perfect agreement"). 
      Interrater reliability for 4 of the 6 core features had "substantial" agreement 
      (behavioral disinhibition, perseverative/compulsive, sympathy/empathy, 
      hyperorality; κ = 0.61-0.80), whereas 2 had "moderate" agreement (apathy/inertia, 
      neuropsychological; κ = 0.41-0.6). Clinician years of experience did not 
      significantly influence rater accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The FTDC criteria show 
      promise for improving the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of clinicians and 
      researchers. As disease-altering therapies are developed, accurate differential 
      diagnosis between bvFTD and other neurodegenerative diseases will become 
      increasingly important.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the time from symptom onset to institutionalization in 
      persons with young-onset dementia (YOD) and compare these findings with 
      late-onset dementia (LOD), and to determine which factors predict 
      institutionalization in persons with YOD compared with LOD. DESIGN/SETTING: 
      Longitudinal study of community-dwelling patients with YOD and LOD and their 
      caregivers. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 226 patients with YOD and 102 with LOD and 
      their informal caregivers were recruited through memory clinics and health care 
      facilities. MEASUREMENTS: Cox proportional hazard models were used to relate 
      covariates with time to institutionalization. The main outcome was time from 
      symptom onset to institutionalization. Key predictors were cohort (YOD or LOD), 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms, caregiver distress caused by neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms, and caregivers' sense of competence (Short Sense of Competence 
      Questionnaire total score). RESULTS: The time from symptom onset to 
      institutionalization was nearly 9 years for patients with YOD compared with 
      approximately 4 years for patients with LOD. In the YOD group, apathy 
      significantly predicted time of institutionalization. Furthermore, the 
      caregiver's competence in caring for the person with dementia significantly 
      predicted institutionalization in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with YOD are 
      cared for at home for a longer period than patients with LOD. The results of this 
      study underline the importance of a timely diagnosis for these patients and their 
      families to facilitate the initiation of appropriate care and support. Support 
      programs aimed at enhancing the caregivers' sense of competence and ability to 
      deal with neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially apathy, may postpone the 
      institutionalization of the patient.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) patient and caregiver reports of patient functioning are 
      often used interchangeably in clinical and research settings; however, the 
      consistency of these reports is largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate 
      the consistency and predictors of discrepancy between self- and caregiver reports 
      of patient apathy, disinhibition, and executive dysfunction. Fifty-one pairs of 
      nondemented PD patients and their caregivers completed the frontal systems 
      behavior scale (FrSBe). Patients were administered a neuropsychological battery, 
      and mood and burden were assessed in a subset of caregivers. Patients and 
      caregivers significantly differed in their ratings of all retrospective 
      prediagnosis behaviors and current levels of disinhibition. Current levodopa 
      equivalent dosages predicted patient-caregiver rating differences in prediagnosis 
      and current apathy and current executive dysfunction, while patient motor 
      function, cognition, and mood failed to predict any disparities in ratings. 
      Caregiver burden and depression were associated with apathy rating discrepancies, 
      while burden was associated with discrepancies in ratings of disinhibition. These 
      results suggest that consistency of patient and caregiver behavioral ratings may 
      vary depending on the behavior assessed; and underscore the importance of 
      considering the reporter when using subjective measures, as discrepancies in 
      behavioral reports may be influenced by specific patient and/or caregiver 
      symptoms or factors.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fatigue is a common symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, a 
      multidimensional scale that measures the impact of fatigue on functioning has yet 
      to be validated in this population. The aim of this study was to examine the 
      validity of the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), a self-report measure that 
      assesses the effects of fatigue on physical, cognitive, and psychosocial 
      functioning, in a sample of nondemented PD patients. METHODS: PD patients (N = 
      100) completed the MFIS, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X), and 
      several additional measures of psychosocial, cognitive, and motor functioning. A 
      Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and item analysis using Cronbach's alpha were 
      conducted to determine structural validity and internal consistency of the MFIS. 
      Correlational analyses were performed between the MFIS and the PANAS-X fatigue 
      subscale to evaluate convergent validity and between the MFIS and measures of 
      depression, anxiety, apathy, and disease-related symptoms to determine divergent 
      validity. RESULTS: The PCA identified two viable MFIS subscales: a cognitive 
      subscale and a combination of the original scale's physical and psychosocial 
      subscales as one factor. Item analysis revealed high internal consistency of all 
      21 items and the items within the two subscales. The MFIS had strong convergent 
      validity with the PANAS-X fatigue subscale and adequate divergent validity with 
      measures of disease stage, motor function, and cognition. CONCLUSION: Overall, 
      this study demonstrates that the MFIS is a valid multidimensional measure that 
      can be used to evaluate the impact of fatigue on cognitive and physical/social 
      functioning in PD patients without dementia.

TI  - Self-reported depressive syndromes in mild cognitive impairment and mild 
      Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 439-44
LID - 10.1017/S1041610212001676 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is suggestion that self-reported depressive syndromes can 
      independently manifest in the general population as cognitive/affective or 
      somatic/vegetative. The Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd edition (BDI-II), a 
      self-report measure of depressive symptoms, has been shown to support this 
      two-factor structure. However, this finding has not been examined in an older 
      adult sample with cognitive impairment. In order to determine whether older 
      adults with cognitive impairments exhibit similarly independent 
      cognitive/affective and somatic/vegetative depressive syndromes, we explored the 
      factor structure of the BDI-II in this population. METHODS: Participants were 228 
      older adults (mean age = 74, SD = 7.9) diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment 
      (MCI; n = 137) or early Alzheimer's disease (n = 85), who completed the BDI-II as 
      part of an outpatient neuropsychological evaluation. Exploratory principal 
      component factor analysis with direct Oblimin rotation was conducted, and a 
      two-factor solution was specified based on our theoretical conceptualization of 
      the cognitive/affective and somatic/vegetative items from the scale. RESULTS: The 
      first factor represented cognitive/affective symptoms of depression (e.g. 
      self-dislike, pessimism, worthlessness), and accounted for 36% of the variance. 
      Adding the second factor, reflecting somatic/vegetative items (e.g. sleep and 
      appetite changes, loss of energy), accounted for an additional 6.8% of the 
      variance. CONCLUSION: Results supported the presence of two distinct depressive 
      syndromes, cognitive/affective and somatic/vegetative symptoms. Thus, cognitively 
      impaired older adults report mood symptoms relatively similarly to younger and 
      midlife adults. This supports the validity of self-reported mood in this group, 
      and the results may have implications for psychiatric treatment in this 
      population.

LID - 10.1037/a0031265 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examine the rates of major depressive disorder, single episode 
      determined by the Inventory to Diagnose Depression (IDD) in a clinical sample of 
      persons with recent-onset spinal cord injury (SCI; ≤52 weeks) participating in an 
      inpatient SCI rehabilitation program. We also analyzed the factor structure of 
      the IDD measure in an attempt to replicate the factor structure reported by Frank 
      et al. (1992), and we examined item endorsement patterns. DESIGN: A retrospective 
      chart review was conducted. Participants were 354 individuals (93 women, 261 men) 
      in an inpatient SCI rehabilitation program. RESULTS: Fifteen percent of the 
      sample met criteria for a major depressive disorder (MDD). A higher rate of 
      depression was observed among women. A "dysphoria" factor accounted for 24% of 
      the variance in the final four-factor model. The four-factor solution explained a 
      total of 35.5% of the variance, with an "anhedonia" factor contributing 4.6%, a 
      "sleep" factor contributing 3.5%, and an "appetite" factor contributing 3.5%, 
      respectively. Items assessing symptoms of insomnia, weight loss, worrying about 
      health, and decreased energy had the highest percentage of endorsement to meet 
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text 
      Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for clinical significance. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of 
      single episodes of MDD determined by the IDD parallels the rate observed with the 
      Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The factor structure of the IDD was 
      similar to that reported by Frank et al. (1992). Information provided by the IDD 
      about the presence and severity of MDD symptoms can inform interventions for 
      persons with SCI.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Somatically ill patients in somatic rehabilitation 
      often show comorbid psychological distress and mental disorders. In the framework 
      of the implementation of a stepwise psychodiagnostic procedure, the present study 
      investigated the intention to use and the use of treatment due to psychological 
      distress. METHODOLOGY: Cohort study with a 6-months follow-up in 5 orthopedic, 
      cardiologic and oncologic inpatient rehabilitation clinics (n=1 374). 
      Psychological distress, sociodemographic data, intention to use psychotherapeutic 
      or psychiatric treatments and the use of health care offers due to psychological 
      distress were assessed by means of questionnaires. RESULTS: Every third patient 
      (34%) was psychologically distressed at the beginning of rehabilitation. A 
      positive intention to use psychotherapeutic or psychiatric treatment was reported 
      by 79% of the psychologically distressed patients. 6 months after the end of 
      rehabilitation, 26% of the patients who were psychologically distressed at the 
      beginning of rehabilitation, had received treatment for mental health reasons. 
      Reasons for non-utilization of treatment included lack of subjective need (45%) 
      and lack of interest in treatment despite a perceived need (30%). Further 25% 
      were considering treatment or were seeking appropriate treatment. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Psychologically distressed rehabilitation patients show a high intention to 
      undergo treatment. However, they show a clearly diminished use of 
      post-rehabilitative treatments due to mental health problems. Hence, the 
      promotion of motivation as well as the management of treatment barriers for 
      improving post-rehabilitative use in psychologically distressed rehabilitants are 
      of particular importance.

TI  - Post-stroke apathy: an exploratory longitudinal study.
PG  - 507-13
LID - 10.1159/000350202 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low 
      initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed 
      activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional 
      indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We 
      aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after 
      stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing 
      conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety 
      disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological 
      symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and 
      (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. 
      METHODS: Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without 
      aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke 
      and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated 
      version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression 
      (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment 
      (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and 
      non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), 
      functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health 
      (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (χ(2) and t test) and 
      stepwise multivariate analysis. RESULTS: We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% 
      women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of 
      education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 
      (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute 
      apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of 
      post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with 
      previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive 
      impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. 
      In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds 
      ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as 
      independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not 
      report worse quality of life or health. CONCLUSION: Apathy in acute stroke phase 
      was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both 
      phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for 
      post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed 
      activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional 
      outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.

TI  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms in amnestic mild cognitive impairment: increased risk 
      and faster progression to dementia.
PG  - 86-94
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) but its role as a predictive factor for the progression to 
      dementia is still not clear. The objective of this study is to identify NPS that 
      predict the progression from amnestic MCI (a-MCI) to dementia using an easy to 
      administer screening tool for NPS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 132 patients with a-MCI 
      were assessed for NPS by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and followed to 
      detect progression to dementia. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 3.5±2.9 
      years and rate of progression to dementia 28.8%. Two items of NPI were found to 
      be independent risk factors for progression, nighttime behavioural disturbance 
      (hazard ratio(HR)=2.2, 95%CI=1.10-4.43), anxiety (HR=2.5, 95%CI=1.01-6.20) and 
      apathy (HR=2.2, 95%CI=1.003-4.820). The risk of progression increased with higher 
      score on NPI (HR=1.046 per point, 95%CI=1.019- 1.073), and with a higher number 
      of items of NPI affected (HR=3.6 per item, 95%CI=2.0-6.4). Faster progression to 
      dementia was observed in patients with either nighttime behavioural disturbance, 
      apathy or anxiety (4.6 vs. 8.3 years, 5.3 vs. 8.4 years and 3.0 vs. 7.7 years 
      respectively, p < 0.01) as well as in those with a higher number of items 
      affected (no items = 9.2 years, 1-3 items = 6.6 years and > 3 items = 2.9 years, 
      p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Assessing a broad spectrum of NPS can help identify 
      patients with a-MCI presenting a higher risk for progression to dementia. This 
      can be useful to select patients for closer follow-up, clinical trials and future 
      therapeutic interventions.

LID - 10.1007/s00415-012-6600-9 [doi]
AB  - Non-motor symptoms (NMS) of Parkinson's disease (PD) have only recently been 
      increasingly recognized for their impact on a patient's quality of life. In this 
      study, we applied the validated, comprehensive self-completed NMS questionnaire 
      for PD (NMS Quest) to 101 patients with young-onset PD (onset between 21 and 45 
      years, YOPD) and 107 patients with late-onset PD (onset of PD ≥ 55 years, LOPD). 
      The mean total NMS (NMSQ-T) was 11.9 ± 6.0 (range: 0 to of a maximum of 26) in 
      LOPD and 7.7 ± 5.8 (range: 0 to of a maximum of 26) in YOPD (p < 0.05). Compared 
      to YOPD, dribbling of saliva, loss of taste/smell, nocturia, forgetfulness, loss 
      of interest, hallucinations, lack of concentration, anxiety, change in libido and 
      difficulty in sexual activities, were significantly more prevalent in LOPD. The 
      only NMS more prevalent in YOPD were restless legs and sweating, although such 
      findings might be associated with drug effects. Among the nine NMS Quest domains, 
      in both LOPD and YOPD patients the three most prevalent domains were 
      depression/anxiety, urinary and sexual. Also, in both groups, 
      hallucinations/delusions had the lowest frequency. In the multivariate linear 
      regression model, the Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stage of the disease and activities of 
      daily living scores in YOPD patients, while only the HY stage in LOPD patients 
      appeared to be statistically significant predictors of increasing number of NMS. 
      In contrast to a previous suggestion that YOPD patients might have an increased 
      risk for NMS, we found a higher prevalence of NMS in LOPD patients than in those 
      with YOPD.

TI  - Validation of the Head and Neck Patient Symptom Checklist as a nutrition impact 
      symptom assessment tool for head and neck cancer patients.
PG  - 27-34
LID - 10.1007/s00520-012-1483-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test the validity of the Head and Neck 
      Patient Symptom Checklist (HNSC). METHODS: Three hundred and sixty-eight 
      treatment-naive individuals with head and neck cancer prospectively completed the 
      HNSC and the Patient-Generated Symptom Global Assessment (PG-SGA). The predictive 
      validity was determined by comparing the HNSC symptoms interference scores to the 
      PG-SGA scores. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the HNSC 
      symptoms scores associated with reduced dietary intake, ≥ 5 % weight loss over 6 
      months, and reduced functional performance (FP). RESULTS: HNSC sensitivity (79-98 
      %), specificity (99-100 %), positive predictive value (92-100 %), and negative 
      predictive value (94-100 %) were excellent, and the Cronbach's alpha coefficient 
      was 0.92. The multivariate logistic regression showed that advanced tumor stage, 
      pain, loss of appetite (LOA), and difficulty swallowing significantly predicted 
      dietary intake. Advanced tumor stage, LOA, and difficulty swallowing were also 
      significant predictors of ≥ 5 % weight loss over 6 months. LOA, difficulty 
      swallowing, feeling full, and lack of energy were significant predictors of 
      reduced FP. CONCLUSIONS: The HNSC appears to be a valid tool for determining 
      symptoms interfering with dietary intake of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. 
      This instrument may aid in early identification of symptoms that place HNC 
      patients at risk for reductions in dietary intake, weight, and functional 
      performance.

TI  - The contribution of general and cancer-related variables in explaining physical 
      activity in a breast cancer population 3 weeks to 6 months post-treatment.
PG  - 203-11
LID - 10.1002/pon.2079 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Physical activity determinants are subject to change when confronted 
      with the diagnosis of 'cancer' and new cancer-related determinants appear. The 
      aim of the present study is to compare the contribution of cancer-related 
      determinants with more general ones in explaining physical activity 3 weeks to 6 
      months post-treatment. METHODS: A theory-based and validated questionnaire was 
      used to identify physical activity levels (total and domain-specific) and 
      associated determinants among 464 breast cancer survivors (aged 18 to 65 years) 3 
      weeks to 6 months post-treatment. RESULTS: Descriptive analyses showed higher 
      scores for general determinants in comparison with cancer-related determinants. 
      Nevertheless, regression analyses showed that both general and cancer-related 
      determinants explained total and domain-specific physical activity. 
      Self-efficacy, enjoyment, social support, lack of time and lack of company were 
      important general determinants. The perception of returning to normal life, 
      cancer-related barriers (fatigue, lack of energy and physical side effects) and 
      self-efficacy in overcoming these barriers were important cancer-related 
      determinants. Although results differed according to the women's working status 
      and the physical activity domain, general self-efficacy explained most physical 
      activity types in both groups. CONCLUSION: Comparable with the general 
      population, enhancing breast cancer survivors' self-efficacy in being 
      sufficiently physically active seems to be important in physical activity 
      interventions post-treatment. However, interventions should be tailored to the 
      experienced symptoms and working status of the women.

TI  - Evaluating sleepiness-related daytime function by querying wakefulness inability 
      and fatigue: Sleepiness-Wakefulness Inability and Fatigue Test (SWIFT).
PG  - 701-11
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.2270 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Routine assessment of daytime function in Sleep Medicine has 
      focused on "tendency to fall asleep" in soporific circumstances, to the exclusion 
      of "wakefulness inability" or inability to maintain wakefulness, and 
      fatigue/tiredness/lack of energy. The objective was to establish reliability and 
      discriminant validity of a test for wakefulness inability and fatigue, and to 
      test its superiority against the criterion standard for evaluation of 
      sleepiness-the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). METHODS: A 12-item 
      self-administered instrument, the Sleepiness-Wakefulness Inability and Fatigue 
      Test (SWIFT), was developed and administered, with ESS, to 256 adults ≥ 18 years 
      of age (44 retook the tests a month later); consecutive patients with symptoms of 
      sleep disorders including 286 with obstructive sleep apnea ([OSA], apnea-hypopnea 
      index ≥ 5/h sleep on polysomnography [PSG]), 49 evaluated with PSG and multiple 
      sleep latency test for narcolepsy and 137 OSA patients treated with continuous 
      positive airway pressure (CPAP). RESULTS: SWIFT had internal consistency 0.87 and 
      retest intraclass coefficient 0.82. Factor analysis revealed 2 factors-general 
      wakefulness inability and fatigue (GWIF) and driving wakefulness inability and 
      fatigue (DWIF). Normal subjects differed from patients in ESS, SWIFT, GWIF, and 
      DWIF. SWIFT and GWIF (but not DWIF) had higher area under ROC curve, Youden's 
      index, and better positive and negative likelihood ratios than ESS. ESS, SWIFT, 
      GWIF, and DWIF improved with CPAP. Improvements in SWIFT, GWIF, and DWIF (but not 
      ESS) were significantly correlated with CPAP compliance. CONCLUSIONS: SWIFT is 
      reliable and valid. SWIFT and its factor GWIF have a discriminant ability 
      superior to that of the ESS.

TI  - Psychometric properties of the multidimensional fatigue inventory in Brazilian 
      Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors.

AB  - CONTEXT: Fatigue is the most common symptom among Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors. 
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Brazilian version of 
      the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI). METHODS: The MFI was translated 
      into Brazilian Portuguese using established forward-backward translation 
      procedures, and the psychometric properties were evaluated in a sample of 200 
      Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors. The psychometric properties evaluated included 
      internal consistency and construct validity. The MFI was administered along with 
      the informed consent form. RESULTS: The overall Cronbach's alpha coefficient for 
      the 20 items was 0.84, ranging from 0.59 to 0.81 for each of the five scales. 
      Correlations between items and scales ranged from 0.32 to 0.72. The factor 
      analysis yielded a five-factor solution that explained 65% of the variance. The 
      first factor merged the original "general fatigue" and "physical fatigue" scales, 
      as has been previously reported. The second factor identified the original 
      "mental fatigue" scale and the fifth factor identified the original "reduced 
      activity" scale. Questions from the original "reduced motivation" scale were 
      represented in both factors three and four. CONCLUSION: The Brazilian version of 
      the MFI showed satisfactory psychometric properties and can be considered a valid 
      research tool for assessing cancer-related fatigue.

TI  - Learned helplessness among families and surrogate decision-makers of patients 
      admitted to medical, surgical, and trauma ICUs.
PG  - 1440-1446
LID - S0012-3692(12)60675-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1378/chest.12-0112 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the prevalence of and clinical variables 
      associated with learned helplessness, a psychologic state characterized by 
      reduced motivation, difficulty in determining causality, and depression, in 
      family members of patients admitted to ICUs. METHODS: We conducted an 
      observational survey study of a prospectively defined cohort of family members, 
      spouses, and partners of patients admitted to surgical, medical, and trauma ICUs 
      at a large academic medical center. Two validated instruments, the Learned 
      Helplessness Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale, were used, and self-report of 
      patient clinical characteristics and subject demographics were collected. 
      RESULTS: Four hundred ninety-nine family members were assessed. Of these, 238 of 
      460 (51.7%) had responses consistent with a significant degree of learned 
      helplessness. Among surrogate decision-makers, this proportion was 50% (92 of 
      184). Characteristics associated with significant learned helplessness included 
      grade or high school education (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.29-8.27; P = .01) and 
      Perceived Stress Scale score > 18 (OR, 4.15; 95% CI, 2.65-6.50; P < .001). The 
      presence of a patient advance directive or do not resuscitate (DNR) order was 
      associated with reduced odds of significant learned helplessness (OR, 0.56; 95% 
      CI, 0.32-0.98; P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of family members of patients 
      in the ICU experience significant learned helplessness. Risk factors for learned 
      helplessness include lower educational levels, absence of an advance directive or 
      DNR order, and higher stress levels among family members. Significant learned 
      helplessness in family members may have negative implications in the 
      collaborative decision-making process.

TI  - A short scale for evaluation of neuropsychiatric disorders in Parkinson's 
      disease: first psychometric approach.
PG  - 2299-308
LID - 10.1007/s00415-012-6490-x [doi]
AB  - The neuropsychiatric symptoms and behavioral disorders affecting Parkinson's 
      disease (PD) patients are common and disabling. A PD-specific interview-based 
      12-item scale, the Scale for Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders in 
      Parkinson's Disease (SEND-PD), has been developed to assess the severity of 
      neuropsychiatric manifestations. The present study is aimed at testing some basic 
      psychometric attributes of this scale. A total of 633 consecutive patients and 
      their caregivers were included in this cross-sectional, multicenter, 
      observational study. In addition to the tested scale, the following assessments 
      were applied: Hoehn and Yahr staging, Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease 
      Motor and Psychiatric complications, MiniMental State Examination, Clinical 
      Impression of Severity Index, and the Zarit Caregiver Burden Inventory. Patients 
      in all stages of disease were included and 18.38 % were demented. The SEND-PD was 
      responded by patients (86.16 %), caregivers (13.15 %), or both (0.69 %). Three 
      factors (accounting for 66.63 % of the variance) were identified and considered 
      as subscales: Psychotic symptoms, Mood/Apathy, and Impulse control disorders. The 
      subscales showed satisfactory scaling assumptions (multitrait-item success rate 
      100 %) and internal consistency (alpha indices >0.70). The convergent validity 
      with other measures of psychiatric symptoms and the discriminant validity to 
      distinguish between categories of patients' age, duration and severity of 
      disease, and dopaminergic treatment were satisfactory. The precision of the scale 
      dimensions was acceptable. The SEND-PD performed as an acceptable, consistent, 
      valid, and precise scale for evaluation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in 
      Parkinson's disease.

TI  - A predictive scoring instrument for tuberculosis lost to follow-up outcome.
PG  - 75
LID - 10.1186/1465-9921-13-75 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherence to tuberculosis (TB) treatment is troublesome, due to long 
      therapy duration, quick therapeutic response which allows the patient to 
      disregard about the rest of their treatment and the lack of motivation on behalf 
      of the patient for improved. The objective of this study was to develop and 
      validate a scoring system to predict the probability of lost to follow-up outcome 
      in TB patients as a way to identify patients suitable for directly observed 
      treatments (DOT) and other interventions to improve adherence. METHODS: Two 
      prospective cohorts, were used to develop and validate a logistic regression 
      model. A scoring system was constructed, based on the coefficients of factors 
      associated with a lost to follow-up outcome. The probability of lost to follow-up 
      outcome associated with each score was calculated. Predictions in both cohorts 
      were tested using receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). RESULTS: The 
      best model to predict lost to follow-up outcome included the following 
      characteristics: immigration (1 point value), living alone (1 point) or in an 
      institution (2 points), previous anti-TB treatment (2 points), poor patient 
      understanding (2 points), intravenous drugs use (IDU) (4 points) or unknown IDU 
      status (1 point). Scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 points were associated with a 
      lost to follow-up probability of 2,2% 5,4% 9,9%, 16,4%, 15%, and 28%, 
      respectively. The ROC curve for the validation group demonstrated a good fit 
      (AUC: 0,67 [95% CI; 0,65-0,70]). CONCLUSION: This model has a good capacity to 
      predict a lost to follow-up outcome. Its use could help TB Programs to determine 
      which patients are good candidates for DOT and other strategies to improve TB 
      treatment adherence.

TI  - Neuropsychiatric symptom clusters of Alzheimer's disease in Hong Kong Chinese: 
      prevalence and confirmatory factor analysis of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory.
PG  - 1465-73
LID - 10.1017/S1041610212000609 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the clustering of symptoms 
      on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the relative prevalence of symptom 
      clusters in mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Confirmatory 
      factor analysis (CFA) was performed on the polychoric correlation matrix of 12 
      NPI items (scored yes or no) using the weighted least squares with mean and 
      variance adjustment (WLSMV) estimator in Mplus (N = 224 community-dwelling 
      Chinese persons with mild/moderate AD). Severity of AD was determined by Clinical 
      Dementia Rating scores. The relative model fit of three competing measurement 
      models (also known as factor structures) was tested using a modified χ2 
      difference test. Prevalence rates across mild and moderate stages were compared 
      using χ2 tests. Furthermore, the measurement model of choice was cross-validated 
      in an independent sample of 181 community-dwelling persons with dementia. 
      RESULTS: CFA supported a four-factor model, namely behavioral problems 
      (agitation/aggressiveness, disinhibition, irritability, and aberrant motor 
      behavior), psychosis (delusions and hallucinations), mood disturbance 
      (depression, anxiety, sleep, appetite, and apathy), and euphoria (a stand-alone 
      item that is equivalent to the factor). The most prevalent symptom clusters were 
      behavioral (72%) and mood (69%) disturbances, followed by psychosis (45%). 
      Euphoria was rare (6%). All syndromes were more prevalent in moderate than in 
      mild stage, except for euphoria. In addition, the four-factor model was 
      replicated in the cross-validation sample. CONCLUSIONS: The four syndromes 
      provide a parsimonious conceptualization of neuropsychiatric symptoms 
      corresponding to clinical observations and neurochemical changes of the disease. 
      The independent replication in the second sample supports generalization of the 
      four-factor model in Chinese persons with AD.

TI  - The Oxford Questionnaire on the Emotional Side-effects of Antidepressants 
      (OQuESA): development, validity, reliability and sensitivity to change.
PG  - 66-74
LID - 10.1016/j.jad.2012.01.030 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some patients with major depression report a restricted range of 
      emotions that may appear to arise as a side-effect of treatment with 
      antidepressants. It is uncertain whether this phenomenon, sometimes called 
      emotional blunting, represents residual symptoms of depression or side-effects of 
      antidepressant treatment. There is currently no adequate instrument to measure 
      this phenomenon. METHODS: A draft questionnaire was developed from 
      patient-derived qualitative data, refined using cognitive interviewing, and 
      administered on three occasions to patients taking antidepressants. Statistical 
      methods including factor analysis were used to reduce the size of the draft 
      questionnaire, and to assess the performance of the resulting Oxford 
      Questionnaire on the Emotional Side-effects of Antidepressants (OQuESA). RESULTS: 
      207 patients completed the OQuESA on at least one occasion. Their BDI-II scores 
      and self-reported emotional blunting were spread across the possible range. The 
      factor analysis resulted in four dimensions: 'not caring', 'emotional 
      detachment', 'reduction in positive emotions', and 'general reduction in 
      emotions'. The OQuESA appears to be acceptable, valid, and reliable, with 
      sensitivity to change. CONCLUSIONS: The OQuESA offers promise as an effective 
      self-report measure of the symptoms of emotional blunting in patients with 
      depression. It can be used as a clinical tool, to facilitate the identification 
      of patients with the syndrome of emotional blunting. It should also be used in 
      research studies, to advance our understanding of the nature, causes and 
      treatment of this phenomenon.

TI  - Decreased daytime motor activity associated with apathy in Alzheimer disease: an 
      actigraphic study.
PG  - 806-14
LID - 10.1097/JGP.0b013e31823038af [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Across all stages of Alzheimer disease (AD), apathy is the most common 
      neuropsychiatric symptom. Studies using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) have 
      found that apathy is present in up to 70% of individuals with Alzheimer disease. 
      One of the main difficulties in assessing apathy and other neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms is the absence of reliable, objective measures. Motor activity 
      assessment using ambulatory actigraphy could provide an indirect, objective 
      evaluation of apathy. The aim of our study was to assess the relationship between 
      apathy and daytime motor activity in AD, using ambulatory actigraphy. METHODS: 
      One hundred seven AD outpatients wore a wrist actigraph (Motionlogger) during 
      seven consecutive 24-hour periods to evaluate motor activity. Participants were 
      divided into two subgroups according to their apathy subscores on the NPI: 
      individuals with apathy (NPI-apathy subscores >4) and those without. Daytime mean 
      motor activity scores were compared between the two subgroups. RESULTS: 
      Individuals with AD who had symptoms of apathy (n = 43; age = 79 ± 4.7 years; 
      Mini-Mental State Examination = 20.9 ± 4.8) had significantly lower daytime mean 
      motor activity than AD patients without apathy (n = 64; age = 76.3 ± 7.7; 
      Mini-Mental State Examination = 21.5 ± 4.7), while nighttime mean motor activity 
      did not significantly differ between the two subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Ambulatory 
      actigraphy could be added to currently used questionnaires as a simple, objective 
      technique for assessing apathy in the routine assessment of AD patients.

TI  - Patients undergoing subacute rehabilitation have accurate expectations of their 
      health-related quality of life at discharge.
PG  - 94
LID - 10.1186/1477-7525-10-94 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expectations held by patients and health professionals may affect 
      treatment choices and participation (by both patients and health professionals) 
      in therapeutic interventions in contemporary patient-centered healthcare 
      environments. If patients in rehabilitation settings overestimate their discharge 
      health-related quality of life, they may become despondent as their progress 
      falls short of their expectations. On the other hand, underestimating their 
      discharge health-related quality of life may lead to a lack of motivation to 
      participate in therapies if they do not perceive likely benefit. There is a 
      scarcity of empirical evidence evaluating whether patients' expectations of 
      future health states are accurate. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 
      accuracy with which older patients admitted for subacute in-hospital 
      rehabilitation can anticipate their discharge health-related quality of life. 
      METHODS: A prospective longitudinal cohort investigation of agreement between 
      patients' anticipated discharge health-related quality of life (as reported on 
      the EQ-5D instrument at admission to a rehabilitation unit) and their actual 
      self-reported health-related quality of life at the time of discharge from this 
      unit was undertaken. The mini-mental state examination was used as an indicator 
      of patients' cognitive ability. RESULTS: Overall, 232(85%) patients had all 
      assessment data completed and were included in analysis. Kappa scores ranged from 
      0.42-0.68 across the five EQ-5D domains and two patient cognition groups. The 
      percentage of exact correct matches within each domain ranged from 69% to 85% 
      across domains and cognition groups. Overall 40% of participants in each 
      cognition group correctly anticipated all of their self-reported discharge EQ-5D 
      domain responses. CONCLUSIONS: Patients admitted for subacute in-hospital 
      rehabilitation were able to anticipate their discharge health-related quality of 
      life on the EQ-5D instrument with a moderate level of accuracy. This finding adds 
      to the foundational empirical work supporting joint treatment decision making and 
      patient-centered models of care during rehabilitation following acute illness or 
      injury. Accurate patient expectations of the impact of treatment (or disease 
      progression) on future health-related related quality of life is likely to allow 
      patients and health professionals to successfully target interventions to 
      priority areas where meaningful gains can be achieved.

PG  - 328-32
LID - 10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.02.006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize dietary habits and eating patterns in patients with a 
      urea cycle disorder (UCD), and to identify dietary habits that may serve as clues 
      to lead to earlier diagnosis of these disorders. STUDY DESIGN: This was a 
      retrospective study of clinical and dietary data from hospital records of all 
      patients with UCD (n = 90) attending the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne 
      between 1972 and 2010. RESULTS: Protein aversion, food refusal, frequent 
      vomiting, poor appetite, and adverse reaction to high-protein-containing foods 
      were documented in the majority of patients with available detailed dietary 
      protein intake data. Fourteen of the 90 admissions for metabolic deterioration in 
      which information regarding the precipitating factor(s) were available were 
      directly related to protein intake (5 higher and 9 lower than prescribed). 
      CONCLUSION: Protein aversion is a common feature of UCD and may serve as a 
      diagnostic clue in patients presenting with food refusal, recurrent vomiting, 
      behavioral problems, mental retardation, and "unexplained" episodes of altered 
      consciousness. Dietary history should be included in the investigation of these 
      symptoms, which might lead to earlier diagnosis. Metabolic decompensation is more 
      frequently related to low energy/protein intake than to high protein intake in 
      these patients. Special attention should be given to protein aversion, which 
      often leads to eating patterns that make it difficult for a patient to achieve 
      the prescribed daily protein requirement.

TI  - Anxiety and depression are associated with coping strategies in caregivers of 
      Alzheimer's disease patients: results from the MÁLAGA-AD study.
PG  - 1325-34
LID - 10.1017/S1041610211002948 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Caregiving for people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly 
      stressful and has significant negative consequences, such as anxiety and 
      depression. Previous research offers conflicting findings as to whether coping 
      strategies are associated with greater psychological distress or not. We 
      conducted this study with a view to obtaining new data regarding the association 
      of coping strategies and psychological distress in AD caregivers. METHODS: Eighty 
      people with AD and their primary caregivers living in the community were 
      recruited from local health services. Purposive recruitment was carried out to 
      ensure that the sample was representative of people living with dementia in terms 
      of dementia severity, gender, and care setting. We used the State-Trait Anxiety 
      Inventory to measure anxiety, the Beck Depression Inventory to measure 
      depression, and the Coping Strategies Inventory to measure coping strategies. 
      RESULTS: Most caregivers reported higher anxiety and depression levels. Use of 
      disengagement coping strategies (Wald = 3.35, p = 0.01) and higher caregiver 
      burden (Wald = 4.83, p = 0.02) predicted anxiety on logistic regression. In turn, 
      use of disengagement coping strategies (Wald = 12.48, p = 0.001) and higher 
      caregiver burden (Wald = 6.91, p = 0.009) predicted depression on logistic 
      regression. CONCLUSION: These results may be useful for designing treatment 
      interventions that aim to modify the use of coping strategies and thus reduces 
      caregiver anxiety and depression.

      Routine Outcome Monitoring Study.
PG  - 523-30
LID - 10.1002/da.21958 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the predictive value of items for individual 
      depressive symptoms measured with the self-rated Beck Depression 
      Inventory-Revised (BDI-II) self-report scale on outcome in a large naturalistic 
      cohort of depressive outpatients. METHODS: We used a cohort of 1,489 adult 
      patients aged 18-65 years with major depressive disorder or dysthymic disorder 
      established with the MINI-Plus diagnostic interview. All patients had a routine 
      outcome monitoring baseline measurement in 2004-2009, with a maximum of 2 years 
      follow-up. We used multivariable Cox regression models to predict remission 
      (MADRS < 10; where MADRS stands for Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale) 
      and response (≥50% improvement), and adjusted for clinical and demographic 
      characteristics (i.e. marital status, level of education, working status, 
      comorbid anxiety, avoidant and borderline personality traits, and suicidality) 
      that were identified as predictors in earlier studies. RESULTS: Of the 21 BDI-II 
      items, the items "pessimism" and "loss of energy" independently predicted for 
      both remission and response. For pessimism, the hazard ratio (HR) for remission 
      was 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73-0.89, P < .001) and for loss of 
      energy, the HR was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.72-0.92, P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings of robust prediction of poor outcome by baseline items of "pessimism" 
      and "loss of energy" in a naturalistic treatment setting may help clinicians to 
      identify depressive patients in need for additional or alternative therapeutic 
      approaches.

TI  - Reliability and structural validity of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory 
      (MFI) in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 532-6

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is commonly used in 
      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, most measurement properties have 
      not been investigated in this population. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate internal consistency, test-retest reliability, measurement error, 
      structural validity, and floor and ceiling effects of the MFI in PD. METHODS: 
      Patients with PD (N = 153) completed the MFI at baseline and week 3 in a 
      randomized clinical trial. Cronbach's α, intraclass correlation coefficient 
      (ICC), and the smallest detectable change (SDC) were calculated. Bland and Altman 
      analysis was performed. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to explore 
      structural validity. Floor and ceiling effects were investigated. RESULTS: 
      Cronbach's α for the MFI-total and subscales ranged from 0.74 (reduced motivation 
      (RM)) to 0.92 (MFI-total). ICC's ranged from 0.65 (mental fatigue (MF) to 0.81 
      (physical fatigue (PF)), SDC ranged from 4 points (PF and RM) to 15 points 
      (MFI-total). Bland and Altman analysis showed no systematic differences between 
      assessments. A floor effect was found for MF and ceiling effects for PF and 
      reduced activity (RA). A four-factor model was extracted, combining general 
      fatigue (GF) and PF as one factor. CONCLUSIONS: The MFI is reliable and valid to 
      assess fatigue in patients with PD. Clinicians and researchers interested in 
      assessing specific aspects of fatigue should consider interpreting GF and PF as 
      one subscale measuring physical aspects of fatigue. To establish whether the MFI 
      can detect meaningful changes, studies on anchor-based responsiveness and the 
      minimal important change are needed in PD.

TI  - Adherence to CPAP therapy improves quality of life and reduces symptoms among 
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome patients.
PG  - 563-9
LID - 10.1007/s11325-011-0543-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to asses quality of life and symptoms of 
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) patients after adhering to 6 months of 
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. METHODS: A group of 50 
      patients (41 men and 9 women) were diagnosed by polysomnography and treated with 
      CPAP therapy for 6 months. Their symptoms and health-related quality of life were 
      assessed by administering a validated and translated version of the sleep apnea 
      quality of life index (SAQLI). Sleepiness was measured using the Epworth 
      Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and through electronic monitoring of CPAP usage per night 
      of sleep. RESULTS: Mean CPAP usage was 4.5 ± 0.5 h per night. Comparisons between 
      quality of life indexes before and after CPAP treatment showed an improvement in 
      the total SAQLI score (3.8 ± 0.9 vs. 5.8 ± 0.8 after CPAP, p < 0.01), in daily 
      functioning (4.2 ± 1.4 vs. 6.0 ± 0.9, p < 0.01), social interactions (4.8 ± 1.3 
      vs.6.3 ± 0.7, p < 0.01), emotional functioning (4.4 ± 1.4 vs. 5.7 ± 1.0, 
      p < 0.01), symptoms (1.6 ± 0.8 vs. 5.8 ± 1.2, p < 0.01), and in the ESS 
      (13.7 ± 6.5 vs. 3.9 ± 3.8, p < 0.01). Regarding the patients' symptoms, 
      improvement was noticed for "sleepiness while watching a spectacle" (96%), 
      "reading" (95%), "carrying on a conversation" (95%), "driving" (92.9%), "restless 
      sleep" (87.8%), and "urinating more than once per night" (84.8%). Smaller 
      improvements were observed for the reported "dry mouth-throat upon awakening" 
      (36.1%),"excessive fatigue" (54.5%), and "decreased energy" (55.3%). CONCLUSION: 
      We conclude that OSAS patients who adhere to nighttime CPAP therapy show 
      significant improvement of their quality of life, daytime sleepiness, and other 
      symptoms after 6 months of treatment with CPAP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a major component of the behavioral and psychological 
      symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other types of dementia. Most 
      researchers have reached a consensus on a new set of diagnostic criteria for 
      apathy (DCA) recently. However, no relevant reports on apathy exist for AD 
      patients in Asian countries yet. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of apathy 
      in Chinese AD patients. METHODS: 83 AD patients were recruited for a 
      cross-sectional observational study. Following the new diagnostic criteria for 
      apathy (DCA) and DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), each 
      patient was assessed successively by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory-apathy subscale (NPI-apathy), the Geriatric Depression 
      Screening scale (GDS), and the Caregiver Burden Scale (CBS). RESULTS: According 
      to the DCA, we found that the frequency of apathy in Chinese AD patients reached 
      61.4%. The DCA had very good standard validity and internal consistency. The 
      frequency of apathy was not significantly associated with that of depression, 
      whereas there was a significant association between apathy and more severe 
      cognitive deficits. Caregiver burden was significantly associated with severity 
      of apathy. CONCLUSIONS: From the symptoms of a group of Chinese AD patients, we 
      summarized a set of effective methods for the diagnosis and assessment of apathy.

AB  - AIM: Apathy is a well-recognized symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of 
      the present study was to validate the Taiwanese version of the Apathy Evaluation 
      Scale, clinician version (AES-C) and assess the severity of apathy in patients 
      with AD. METHODS: Comprehensive evaluations were conducted in a total of 144 AD 
      patients. This study used a cross-sectional comparative design. Data were 
      collected from clinical interviews using the AES, the Mini-Mental Status 
      Examination (MMSE), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and the Clinical 
      Dementia Rating Scale (CDR). RESULTS: Internal consistency was indicated by 
      Cronbach's alphas of 0.85; test-retest reliability was 0.89 over a period of 3 
      days. Criterion-related validity was supported by the fact that AES-C 
      significantly correlated with the apathy scores of the NPI. Factor analysis 
      indicated a three-factor structure. Convergent validity was supported by a 
      positive correlation between the AES-C score and the anxiety score of the NPI. 
      Discriminant validity was supported by the fact that the AES-C scores did not 
      correlate with the depression subscale of the NPI, and the correlation between 
      the AES-C score and the euphoria score of the NPI score was negative. Known-group 
      validity was supported by results showing that AD patients in a moderate stage of 
      dementia (CDR = 2) had significantly higher scores on the AES-C than patients 
      with mild-stage dementia (CDR = 1). CONCLUSION: The AES-C is a reliable and valid 
      instrument for measuring symptoms of apathy among AD patients in Taiwan.

TI  - Suboptimal perception of illness due to self-realization constraints impairs 
      psychological welfare in surgical patients.
PG  - 824-8
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezr134 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recognizing patients' psychological problems and understanding their 
      social needs constitute important tasks for medical personnel, because these 
      issues substantially contribute to overall outcome of treatment. People afflicted 
      with surgical diseases need to determine the sense of everyday pursuits and 
      activities and balance it against the therapeutic process. The aim of the study 
      was to assess the relationships between the perception of illness, satisfaction 
      with life and meaning of life among surgical patients. METHODS: A total of 225 
      patients undergoing surgical treatment in the thoracic surgery department were 
      enrolled in the questionnaire study using Multidimensional Essence of Disease and 
      Illness Scale (MEDIS), Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) and Life 
      Meaningfulness Scale (LMS). Relationships between variables were assessed with 
      Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: The analysis disclosed negative correlations 
      between the perception of the disease in the light of self-realization 
      constraints and the feeling of satisfaction with one's life (R = -0.25; P < 
      0.01), an affective component of the LMS (R = -0.29; P < 0.001) and the total 
      result of the LMS (R = -0.21; P < 0.01). Similar relationships were observed 
      between the MEDIS dimension describing a disease as a social withdrawal and the 
      total result of the SWLS (R = -0.21; P < 0.05) and the affective component of the 
      LMS (R = -0.23; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal hospitalization-related 
      perception of the disease due to self-realization constraints profoundly impairs 
      psychological welfare of patients and may exert negative impact on the overall 
      outcome of treatment. We believe that surgical patients require early 
      psychological, social and spiritual support to prevent these harmful 
      psycho-social consequences of illness and hospital stay. Preoperative clinical 
      application of presented scales may be useful to select patients who require more 
      psychological attention in providing information about planned surgical treatment 
      and expected outcomes.

      Questionnaire (SADQH-10).
PG  - 372-81
LID - 10.1177/0269215511422388 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the psychometric properties of an observational screening 
      measure of depressive symptoms (SADQH-10; 10-item Hospital version of the Stroke 
      Aphasic Depression Questionnaire) for use in stroke patients with aphasia and to 
      determine the convergent and divergent validity of the SADQH-10. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional cohort. SETTING: Hospital and community. PARTICIPANTS: Stroke 
      patients with aphasia (n = 165) were recruited through hospital wards and 
      community services as part of a randomised controlled trial. Participants were 
      aged 29 to 94 years (68.6 ± 12.1) and 65% were men. RESULTS: The SADQH-10 
      demonstrated good internal consistency (α = 0.77). Factor analysis revealed the 
      SADQH-10 to be measuring three constructs (social interaction and physical pain, 
      tearfulness, loss of interest and motivation). Significant correlations were 
      found between scores on the SADQH-10 and VAMS 'sad' item (r(s) = 0.297, P < 0.01) 
      but not with the VASES 'depression' item (r(s) = 0.064, P = 0.590) or measures of 
      physical and language abilities. CONCLUSIONS: The SADQH-10 is both a valid and 
      reliable observational screening measure of depressive symptoms for stroke 
      patients with aphasia.

TI  - Differences in psychological perception of lung cancer between patients, medical 
      staff and medical students.
PG  - 607-11
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezr046 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In clinical practice, medical staff is often unaware that what they 
      think about patient's disease differs much from the perceptions and feelings of 
      the patient. The aim of the study was to analyse the differences in psychological 
      perception of lung cancer between patients treated with combined regimen for lung 
      cancer (n = 30), medical staff (n = 94) and medical students (n = 303). METHODS: 
      A total of 427 persons were enrolled in this questionnaire study using 
      Imagination and Perception of Illness Scale (IPIS) by Sak. The IPIS scale items 
      described: loss of motivation to carry out specific activities (eight items), 
      mental sphere destruction (six items), physical sphere destruction (eight items), 
      pessimism (four items), being a burden to others (three items) and loss of 
      control over the illness (three items). A seven-point scale from '0', meaning the 
      choice of maximum positive feature, to '6', meaning the choice of maximum 
      negative feature, was used. The higher result obtained within a given factor 
      signified the more negative perception of the illness. RESULTS: In all IPIS 
      items, the results among patients were significantly lower than among medical 
      staff or students (P = 0.018 and P = 0.001, respectively). Medical staff and 
      students perceive lung cancer as causing more profound destruction in patient's 
      mental and physical spheres than patients do. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated for 
      lung cancer with combined regimen perceive their disease more optimistically than 
      what is imagined by medical staff and students, and may underestimate the threat. 
      It may be explained by psychological adaptation of patients to their disease 
      during prolonged treatment. We believe that informing lung cancer patients in 
      detail about their illness should be recommended to enhance self-awareness and 
      doctor-patient cooperation.

TI  - A comparative validation of the abbreviated Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-10) with

      apathy.
PG  - 308.e1-6
LID - 10.1016/j.jamda.2011.06.003 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the Neuropsychiatric Inventory apathy subscale (NPIa) with 
      the abbreviated Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-10) on discriminant validity and on 
      their performance to distinguish residents as apathetic or nonapathetic. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional design. SETTING: Nursing home. PARTICIPANTS: 100 residents of 4 
      dementia special care units (n = 58) and 3 somatic units (n = 42). MEASUREMENTS: 
      Primary professional caregivers were interviewed to score the AES-10 and NPIa. 
      The elderly care physician and the psychologist of each unit examined residents 
      for clinical apathy using diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: The AES-10 and NPIa 
      correlated moderately with each other (r(s) = 0.62, P < .0001). The AES-10 
      correlated weakly (r(s) = 0.27, P = .024) and the NPIa moderately (r(s) = 0.46, 
      P = .001) with the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. Receiver operating 
      characteristic analysis showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72 (P < .01) 
      for AES-10 and 0.67 (P < .05) for NPIa. The AES-10 produced higher sums of 
      sensitivity and negative predictive value than the NPIa. Explorative analyses 
      revealed that both instruments produced higher scores in dementia independently 
      of having an apathy diagnosis, whereas AUCs were significant in nondementia 
      (AES-10: AUC = 0.88, P < .001; NPIa: AUC = 0.77, P = .023), but not in dementia. 
      CONCLUSION: Both the AES-10 and NPIa may be used to distinguish apathetic from 
      nonapathetic residents in a heterogeneous sample with and without dementia, or in 
      residents without dementia. The AES-10 may be preferable to the NPIa apathy 
      subscale when ruling out or screening for apathy. The performance of the scales 
      against diagnostic criteria of apathy in dementia need to be further examined.

TI  - Prevalence, distribution, and impact of mild cognitive impairment in Latin 
      America, China, and India: a 10/66 population-based study.
PG  - e1001170
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001170 [doi]
LID - e1001170
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid demographic ageing is a growing public health issue in many 
      low- and middle-income countries (LAMICs). Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a 
      construct frequently used to define groups of people who may be at risk of 
      developing dementia, crucial for targeting preventative interventions. However, 
      little is known about the prevalence or impact of MCI in LAMIC settings. METHODS 
      AND FINDINGS: Data were analysed from cross-sectional surveys established by the 
      10/66 Dementia Research Group and carried out in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Peru, 
      Mexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, China, and India on 15,376 individuals aged 65+ 
      without dementia. Standardised assessments of mental and physical health, and 
      cognitive function were carried out including informant interviews. An algorithm 
      was developed to define Mayo Clinic amnestic MCI (aMCI). Disability (12-item 
      World Health Organization disability assessment schedule [WHODAS]) and 
      informant-reported neuropsychiatric symptoms (neuropsychiatric inventory [NPI-Q]) 
      were measured. After adjustment, aMCI was associated with disability, anxiety, 
      apathy, and irritability (but not depression); between-country heterogeneity in 
      these associations was only significant for disability. The crude prevalence of 
      aMCI ranged from 0.8% in China to 4.3% in India. Country differences changed 
      little (range 0.6%-4.6%) after standardization for age, gender, and education 
      level. In pooled estimates, aMCI was modestly associated with male gender and 
      fewer assets but was not associated with age or education. There was no 
      significant between-country variation in these demographic associations. 
      CONCLUSIONS: An algorithm-derived diagnosis of aMCI showed few sociodemographic 
      associations but was consistently associated with higher disability and 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms in addition to showing substantial variation in 
      prevalence across LAMIC populations. Longitudinal data are needed to confirm 
      findings-in particular, to investigate the predictive validity of aMCI in these 
      settings and risk/protective factors for progression to dementia; however, the 
      large number affected has important implications in these rapidly ageing 
      settings.

COIS- The 10/66 Dementia Research Group (DRG) works closely with Alzheimer's Disease 
      International (ADI), the non-profit federation of 77 Alzheimer associations 
      around the world. ADI is committed to strengthening Alzheimer associations 
      worldwide, raising awareness regarding dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and 
      advocating for more and better services for people with dementia and their 
      caregivers. ADI is supported in part by grants from GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, 
      Lundbeck, Pfizer, and Eisai. Concerning the relationship with ADI, the 10/66 
      Dementia Research Group is an autonomous research network administered from the 
      Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. Its relationship with Alzheimer's 
      Disease International is primarily around research dissemination; the 10/66 
      project website is hosted on the ADI server, and the cost of developing the site

TI  - Psychometric properties of the Starkstein Apathy Scale in patients with early 
      untreated Parkinson disease.
PG  - 142-8
LID - 10.1097/JGP.0b013e31823038f2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: : Although the 14-item Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS) is recommended 
      to screen for and measure the severity of apathetic symptoms in Parkinson disease 
      (PD), the psychometric attributes of this scale have not yet been fully 
      evaluated. OBJECTIVE: : The authors examined the reliability, factor structure, 
      and discriminant validity of the SAS in 194 nondemented patients with early 
      untreated PD. DESIGN: : Cross-sectional multicenter population-based study from 
      Western and Southern Norway. MEASUREMENTS: : Standardized rating scales for 
      parkinsonism and neuropsychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: : The SAS showed fair 
      internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.69) and exploratory factor analysis 
      identified two factors: the first factor (24.2% of the variance) represented 
      cognitive-behavioral aspects of apathy (items 1, 2, and 4-8; Cronbach's α = 0.74) 
      and the second factor (15.0% of the variance) a general apathy dimension (items 3 
      and 9-14; Cronbach's α = 0.52). The correlation between these two factors was low 
      (Spearman's r = 0.19, N = 194, p = 0.008), indicating clinically distinct 
      dimensions, but both factor scores were strongly related to the total SAS score 
      (Spearman's r > 0.6, N = 194, p < 0.0005). Item 3 (insight or self-reflection) 
      showed a negative item-total correlation, and removing this item raised the 
      Cronbach's α of the second factor to 0.70, but did not substantially alter the 
      other results. Both the total score and factor scores of SAS showed fair 
      discriminant validity. CONCLUSIONS: : Although the SAS showed fairly good 
      psychometric properties and the exploratory factor analysis suggested a 
      two-factor solution, the results with this PD sample indicate that item 3 is 
      ambiguous and should be considered removed from the scale.

TI  - Farsi version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory: validity and reliability study 
      among Iranian elderly with dementia.
PG  - 223-30
LID - 10.1017/S1041610211001797 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to validate the Farsi version of Neuropsychiatric 
      Inventory (F-NPI), with the aim of promoting clinical assessment and local 
      research on evaluation of neuropsychiatric symptom profiles of individuals with 
      dementia in Iran. METHODS: In this cross-sectional, psychometric study, 100 
      patients with dementia in the age range of 60–90 years participated. Two trained 
      psychiatrists interviewed the study subjects. Positive and Negative Symptoms 
      Scale (PANSS) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were used to determine the 
      concurrent validity. Testretest,inter-rater reliability and internal consistency 
      were calculated. Discrimination validity was determined,using a matched control 
      group consisting of 49 participants without dementia. Cronbach’s α and Pearson’ 
      scorrelation coefficients were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The internal 
      consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.9) was excellent. The inter-rater reliability 
      varied between 0.6 and 0.98 for frequency, severity and total scale of the F-NPI, 
      and test-retest reliability was between 0.4 and 0.96. Concurrent validity varied 
      between 0.3 and 0.9 (P < 0.05). The most prevalent symptom was “apathy” and the 
      least prevalent was “euphoria”. CONCLUSION: The Farsi version of NPI has 
      satisfactory psychometric indexes and is applicable for clinical and study works 
      in Iranian community.

TI  - Validation of the Icelandic version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory with 
      Caregiver Distress (NPI-D).
PG  - 26-32
LID - 10.3109/08039488.2011.593100 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dementia is a complex and often debilitating illness, presenting with 
      not only wide-ranging cognitive impairment but also neuropsychiatric challenges, 
      which can have diverse consequences in quality of life for both patient and 
      caregiver. AIM: Studying the validity and reliability of an Icelandic translation 
      of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory with Caregiver Distress (NPI-D). METHODS: NPI-D 
      was administered to 38 primary caregivers of dementia patients. The concurrent 
      validity was explored by statistically comparing the NPI-D to the Behavioural 
      Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD) and the Geriatric 
      Depression Scale (GDS). Regarding caregiver distress, concurrent validity was 
      established between NPI-D, BEHAVE-AD Global Rating and two other caregiver 
      distress scales. RESULTS: Significant correlation was found when total score on 
      the BEHAVE-AD was compared with total score on the NPI-D. All NPI-D subscales 
      achieved significant correlation with the corresponding BEHAVE-AD subscales apart 
      from the 'depression/dysphoria subscale'. This NPI-D subscale correlated however, 
      significantly with the GDS depression scale, a frequent and well validated 
      measure of depressive symptoms in the elderly population. Cronbach's alpha 
      coefficient indicated a high degree of overall internal consistency among the 
      items of the NPI-D. Interestingly, apathy was the most frequent neuropsychiatric 
      disturbance and the only subscale that differed significantly between dementia 
      severity levels. Finally, when studying caregiver distress, the NPI-D showed good 
      concurrent validity with other measures of caregiver burden and distress. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate an acceptable level of validity and 
      reliability; therefore the Icelandic translation of the NPI-D is well suited for 
      identifying neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia and associated caregiver 
      burden.

TI  - Memantine effects on behaviour in moderately severe to severe Alzheimer's 
      disease: a post-marketing surveillance study.
PG  - 23-31
LID - 10.1007/s10072-011-0618-0 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate memantine effectiveness on behavioural and 
      psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in clinical practice and to identify 
      variables that may predict the therapy effects. The effects of memantine on 
      behaviour were analysed in the database of a post-marketing surveillance study 
      promoted by the Lombardy Region Health Office and involving 43 Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) Units. From July to December 2005, 399 moderately severe-to-severe 
      AD patients free of cholinergic medications were enrolled, treated with memantine 
      and followed-up for 6 months. BPSD were assessed in a subgroup of 297 patients 
      [mean age 77 ± 8 years; 73% females; mean neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) score 
      28 ± 24] for whom the 12-item NPI subscores at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months 
      were available. The 12 BPSD were clustered as follows: affect, physical 
      behaviour, psychosis and hypomania. The main outcome measure was the proportion 
      of individual cluster responders at 6 months of therapy. The proportion of 
      individual cluster responders was 30% affect, 24% physical behaviour, 29% 
      psychosis, 27% hypomania. Patients taking 20 mg memantine daily during the study 
      period had a statistically significant higher probability to experience 
      behavioural improvement than those who discontinued treatment or did not complete 
      memantine titration (affect OR 9.0; 95% CI 3.8-21.6; physical behaviour OR 17.8; 
      95% CI 5.9-53.6; psychosis OR 23.6; 95% CI 5.1-110.8). The logistic regression 
      analysis was not applicable to the hypomania subsyndrome because of the low 
      cluster prevalence. The standard 20 mg daily memantine treatment regimen was 
      found to be associated with a modest 6-month behavioural improvement in the 
      affect, physical behaviour and psychosis domains in 24-30% of patients.

TI  - Hello, Who is Calling?: Can Words Reveal the Social Nature of Conversations?
PG  - 112-119
AB  - This study aims to infer the social nature of conversations from their content 
      automatically. To place this work in context, our motivation stems from the need 
      to understand how social disengagement affects cognitive decline or depression 
      among older adults. For this purpose, we collected a comprehensive and 
      naturalistic corpus comprising of all the incoming and outgoing telephone calls 
      from 10 subjects over the duration of a year. As a first step, we learned a 
      binary classifier to filter out business related conversation, achieving an 
      accuracy of about 85%. This classification task provides a convenient tool to 
      probe the nature of telephone conversations. We evaluated the utility of openings 
      and closing in differentiating personal calls, and find that empirical results on 
      a large corpus do not support the hypotheses by Schegloff and Sacks that personal 
      conversations are marked by unique closing structures. For classifying different 
      types of social relationships such as family vs other, we investigated features 
      related to language use (entropy), hand-crafted dictionary (LIWC) and topics 
      learned using unsupervised latent Dirichlet models (LDA). Our results show that 
      the posteriors over topics from LDA provide consistently higher accuracy (60-81%) 
      compared to LIWC or language use features in distinguishing different types of 
      conversations.

AB  - Apathy, an intrinsic disorder of motivation, can manifest in cognitive, 
      affective, and behavioral domains. Recent attempts to formalize diagnostic 
      criteria for apathy have advocated this triadic structure. The Apathy Scale (AS) 
      is the only recommended measure for assessing apathy in Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      by a Movement Disorders task force. We tested the hypothesis that the AS 
      distinctly measures the three proposed domains of apathy in PD. Participants were 
      226 non-demented PD patients. Apathy Scale data were examined with exploratory 
      factor analysis (EFA). The three factor solution resembled the triadic structure 
      of cognitive, behavioral, and affective domains; however, adjustments to the AS 
      may be appropriate.

AB  - Both neuropsychological tests of executive functioning and the Frontal Systems 
      Behavior Scale (FrSBe) consistently predict instrumental activity-of-daily-living 
      capacity. However, the nature of the predictive relationship between the FrSBe 
      and neuropsychological tests of executive functioning has received limited 
      attention. The current study was designed to assess the incremental validity of 
      the FrSBe in predicting instrumental activity-of-daily-living functioning when 
      added to comprehensive testing of executive functioning in a sample of 100 adult 
      general neuropsychological referrals. A composite measure of executive test 
      performance was calculated, and a family member completed the FrSBe and an 
      instrumental activity-of-daily-living measure. Stepwise multiple regression 
      analysis using the executive composite measure and the FrSBe accounted for 44% of 
      the variance in instrumental activity capacity, and the addition of the FrSBe 
      increased predictive ability by approximately 50%. The current results also 
      indicate that FrSBe Scale E is more important as a predictor of instrumental 
      activity capacity than the two self-regulation measures, Scale A and Scale D.

TI  - Farmers' stress and coping in a time of drought.
PG  - 2071
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Farmers as a group have unique attitudes, sources of stress and a 
      heightened risk of suicide. In the context of a prolonged drought and associated 
      stress and increased risk of mental-health problems, this study provides an 
      insight into the levels of psychological distress experienced by different 
      demographic groups within the Australian farming community. The study also 
      addresses a significant gap in the literature by exploring ways in which this 
      unique cohort copes and may better cope, with the inevitable challenges of life 
      'on the land'. METHODS: A sample of 309 drought-affected South Australian farmers 
      and their spouses (M=51.81, SD=11.69) completed questionnaires containing 
      measures of psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale) and 
      coping (situational version of the COPE) in response to a recent stressor. 
      RESULTS: There was<strong> </strong>no significant difference detected between 
      the levels of distress reported by men and women. Younger farmers (25-54 years) 
      were experiencing significantly higher levels of distress than those in the 55-64 
      age group but not those aged 65-74 years. The most commonly employed coping 
      strategies were <em>planning</em>, <em>acceptance</em> and <em>active coping</em> 
      and least used were <em>alcohol/drug use</em>, <em>denial</em>, <em>behavioural 
      disengagement</em> and <em>religion</em>. Gender, age-group and the type of 
      stressor (ie farm related, non-farm related, combination) were found to affect 
      farmers' choice of some coping strategies. A multiple regression analysis 
      suggested that behavioural disengagement<em> </em>(&&num;946;=.28, <em>p</em> < 
      .05),<em> suppression of competing activities </em>(&&num;946;= .20, <em>p <</em> 
      .05)<em>, venting </em>(&&num;946;= .18, <em>p</em> < .05)<em>, 
      </em><em>alcohol/drug use </em>(&&num;946;= .18, <em>p < </em>.05)<em>, </em>and 
      <em>mental disengagement </em>(&&num;946;=.12, <em>p </em>< .05) all 
      significantly and positively predicted distress in this population, collectively 
      accounting for 34.6% of the variance. CONCLUSION: This study offers a rare 
      examination of farmers' psychological distress and coping in a time of drought. 
      The results demonstrate that in this unique context it is erroneous to assume the 
      universality of models of coping that have been validated in other samples. The 
      results provide for the development of tailored interventions to help farmers 
      cope more effectively during future times of drought.

AB  - Aim. The objective of our study has been to evaluate the WHO-5 as a new early 
      screening instrument for apathy in a group of elderly persons. Methods. The WHO-5 
      was compared to the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). The GDS contains five 
      items measuring well-being and ten items measuring depression. The internal 
      validity of the WHO-5 (total score being a sufficient statistic) was evaluated 
      with both parametric and nonparametric item response theory models. The external 
      validity of the WHO-5 and the GDS was evaluated by ROC using depression as index 
      of validity. Results. The item response theory analyses confirmed that the total 
      score of the WHO-5 is a sufficient statistic. The ROC analysis shows an adequate 
      sensitivity (61%) and specificity (84%). The GDS(15) and its two subscales 
      obtained low sensitivity (25-42%), but high specificity (90-98%). Conclusion. The 
      WHO-5 was found both internally and externally valid when considering decreased 
      positive well-being to be an early indication of apathy reflecting that the wind 
      has begun to be taken out of the "motivation sail."

      with clinical measures.
PG  - 303-10
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the principal psychopathological dimensions of 
      post-stroke depression (PSD) through the assessment of the factorial structure of 
      the Post-Stroke Depression Rating Scale (PSDRS). METHODS: We enrolled 
      ninety-eight subjects with PSD, who underwent the PSDRS, MMSE and Barthel Index. 
      Information about demographic, clinical, and neuroanatomical factors was 
      collected. RESULTS: The factor analysis extracted three factors accounting for 
      63.4% of the total variance, and identified as: 1) "Depressive and Anxious 
      Symptoms" (DAS); 2) "Lack of Emotional Control" (LEC); 3) "Reduced Motivation" 
      (RM). On multivariate statistics, DAS severity was predicted by previous history 
      of mood disorders and Barthel Index; LEC severity was predicted by Barthel Index; 
      RM severity was predicted by age. CONCLUSIONS: The PSDRS displayed a reliable 
      factor structure that agreed with previous interpretation of PSD. In particular, 
      core depressive symptoms seem to be related to premorbid personality and 
      functional status, whereas apathy/anhedonia may be connected to brain aging.

TI  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms in older people with and without cognitive impairment.
PG  - 411-20
LID - 10.3233/JAD-2012-120169 [doi]
AB  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are non-cognitive disturbances such as 
      depression. Rates of NPS have been shown to increase as cognitive ability 
      declines and may be useful in predicting transition from mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) to dementia. This community-based study reports the association 
      between NPS and cognitive decline over two years. Participants included 873 
      community dwelling adults aged 70-90 years enrolled in the Sydney Memory and 
      Ageing Study. NPS were assessed by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). 
      Cognitive impairment was defined by diagnosis (MCI or incident dementia) or 
      neuropsychological test performance across five cognitive domains. Cognitive 
      decline was defined by progression to dementia or worse neuropsychological 
      performance. Total NPS at baseline did not differ between those without cognitive 
      impairment (26.2%) and those with MCI (28.8%), but agitation and apathy were 
      associated with MCI. Only baseline depression was associated with dementia at 
      follow-up. Total NPS at baseline was cross-sectionally associated with cognitive 
      impairment in executive function, attention, and global cognition, but did not 
      predict cognitive decline. Depression, anxiety, agitation, anxiety, and apathy 
      were all associated with impairment in at least one cognitive domain, but only 
      anxiety and agitation were significantly associated with cognitive decline. 
      Sensitivity analyses applied more stringent criteria for NPS and cognitive 
      impairment in MCI but did not alter interpretation of results from the main 
      analysis. Overall rates of NPS at baseline were not associated with MCI, 
      dementia, or cognitive decline over two years. Additional follow-up is needed to 
      further examine this association over a longer time course.

AB  - New criteria related to prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been proposed to 
      overcome the issue of heterogeneity of patients with mild cognitive impairment

      pro-cholinergic drug (V0191) in patients with prodromal AD. Two hundred forty two 
      (242) patients with a diagnosis of prodromal AD were randomized in an 
      approximately 1 : 1 ratio to receive either 1500 mg V0191 or matching placebo 
      once daily for 24 weeks. Changes in global cognitive functioning were assessed 
      using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog; 
      responder rate as primary efficacy measure). Standardized measures of memory, 
      executive function, attention, functional capacity, and apathy were also 
      obtained. Despite some interesting trends at week 12 and conversion rates 
      favoring V0191, no statistically significant differences in cognitive function 
      between V0191 and placebo were noted. In addition to the absence of drug efficacy 
      on this population, several design features may have hindered this study, 
      including insufficient powering to assess changes in cognition over time, a 
      relatively short duration of treatment, and the lack of validated clinical trial 
      measures designed to assess the prodromal AD population. Lessons learned in AD 
      study design optimization, including those presented in this paper, could be 
      valuable for further investigation with pro-cholinergic drugs such as V0191.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although non-motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease are common 
      and can cause severe disability, they are often under-recognized, leading to 
      missed treatment opportunities. Screening tools for non-motor symptoms are 
      urgently needed. Recently a 30-item screening Non Motor Symptoms Questionnaire 
      was developed. Although some psychometric properties have been evaluated, 
      sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaire have not been systematically 
      assessed. METHODS: Parkinson patients completed Non Motor Symptoms Questionnaire, 
      then underwent a gold-standard clinical evaluation of non-motor symptoms and 
      signs that included extensive standardized questionnaires, cognitive/behavioural 
      assessment, and neurological examination to determine whether each manifestation 
      was present or absent. The sensitivity and specificity of each non-motor symptom, 
      in relation to the gold-standard were estimated. RESULTS: For the 70 
      participants, the mean age was 66.7+/-9.3, 64% were men, and disease duration was 
      3.8+/-2.8 years. From the gold-standard evaluation, the prevalence of non-motor 
      manifestations ranged from 8.7% (hallucinations) to 78.3% (nocturia). The mean 
      sensitivity of all Non Motor Symptoms was 63.4%. This varied considerably among 
      different manifestations, ranging from 24% (sleepiness, hyposmia) to 100% 
      (diplopia). By restricting analysis to clinically significant non-motor problems 
      (i.e. those serious enough to warrant treatment), the mean sensitivity increased 
      to 71.8%. The specificity for most items was high, with an overall mean 
      specificity of 88.5%. CONCLUSIONS: For many non-motor manifestations Non Motor 
      Symptoms Questionnaire is an effective screen; however, for manifestations such 
      as somnolence, olfactory loss and apathy, sensitivity is suboptimal. Overall, 
      this questionnaire can be a useful clinical tool for screening non-motor problems 
      in an office setting.

PG  - 79-83
LID - 10.1002/mds.23939 [doi]
AB  - The UPDRS has been the main outcome measure in studies of PD. Modifications have 
      been made to improve scale properties and represent the breadth of manifestations 
      of PD, particularly nonmotor symptoms (NMS), resulting in the Movement Disorder 
      Society's revision of the UPDRS (MDS-UPDRS). This study was undertaken to 
      determine the validity of MDS-UPDRS Part I (nonmotor experiences of daily 
      living). The MDS-UPDRS and a number of validated scales for the NMS in PD were 
      used in 94 patients with PD from Hoehn and Yahr stage I to V. We assessed 
      reliability, floor and ceiling effects, and correlations with validated scales 
      for the nonmotor symptoms of PD. MDS-UPDRS Part I showed high internal 
      consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.85), small floor and ceiling effects (2% floor 
      and 0% ceiling effect), and good concurrent validity (correlation with the 
      original UPDRS Part I: r = 0.81, P < 0.001). The standardized z-score of the 
      MDS-UPDRS Part I score demonstrated high convergent validity with the composite 
      z-score of nonmotor scales (r = 0.89, P < 0.0001), and the two subscores based on 
      the original factor analysis of Part I also had high correlations with the 
      composite z-scores of corresponding nonmotor scales (depression, anxiety, apathy 
      factor score: r = 0.72, P < 0.0001; other nonmotor features factor score: r = 
      0.87, P < 0.0001). Our data demonstrate that the MDS-UPDRS Part I total score has 
      a strong relationship with a composite score of validated scales for the nonmotor 
      aspects of PD.

TI  - The SEA (Social cognition and Emotional Assessment): a clinical 
      neuropsychological tool for early diagnosis of frontal variant of frontotemporal 
      lobar degeneration.
PG  - 81-90
LID - 10.1037/a0025318 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The frontal variant of frontotemporal degeneration (fvFTD) is 
      characterized by a predominant behavioral syndrome, which is mostly attributable 
      to an orbital-medial prefrontal dysfunction. The orbital and ventral medial 
      prefrontal functions in humans are difficult to assess in clinical practice. 
      Here, we propose a new tool, the SEA (Social cognition and Emotional Assessment), 
      for use in evaluating the functions of the orbital and ventral-medial portions of 
      the prefrontal cortex. METHOD: The SEA is composed of five subtests, each 
      assessing a specific orbitofrontal-related function: a test of identification of 
      facial emotions, a reversal/extinction task, a behavioral control task, a theory 
      of mind test, and an apathy scale. The maximum score is 55. Three groups have 
      been tested: 22 fvFTD patients, 22 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or 
      amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 30 healthy control subjects, all 
      matched for age and educational level. RESULTS: FvFTD patients showed 
      significantly lower performances in all subtests of the SEA. A cut-off score of 
      39.4/55 was proposed to separate normal controls from fvFTD patients, with a 
      maximum sensitivity and specificity of 100%. A very high specificity (88.5%) was 
      obtained using the same cut-off with AD/aMCI patients and normal controls versus 
      fvFTD patients. FvFTD patients' performance in the SEA did not correlate with any 
      other neuropsychological scores, particularly the classical cognitive executive 
      tests. CONCLUSIONS: The SEA is a new and useful tool for diagnosing fvFTD and, 
      more generally, all of the diseases affecting the orbital and medial prefrontal 
      functions.

      patients.
PG  - 136
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-11-136 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The utility of serologic screening for celiac disease is still 
      debatable. Evidence suggests that the disorder remains undetected even in the 
      older population. It remains obscure whether screening makes good or harm in 
      subjects with long-standing gluten ingestion. We evaluated whether older subjects 
      benefit from active detection and subsequent gluten free dietary treatment of 
      celiac disease. METHODS: Thirty-five biopsy-proven patients aged over 50 years 
      had been detected by serologic mass screening. We examined the disease history, 
      dietary compliance, symptoms, quality of life and bone mineral density at 
      baseline and 1-2 years after the commencement of a gluten-free diet. Symptoms 
      were evaluated by gastrointestinal symptom rating scale and quality of life by 
      psychological general well-being questionnaires. Small bowel biopsy, serology, 
      laboratory parameters assessing malabsorption, and bone mineral density were 
      investigated. RESULTS: Dietary compliance was good. The patients had initially 
      low mean serum ferritin values indicating subclinical iron deficiency, which was 
      restored by a gluten-free diet. Vitamin B12, vitamin D and erythrocyte folic acid 
      levels increased significantly on diet. Celiac patients had a history of 
      low-energy fractures more often than the background population, and the diet had 
      a beneficial effect on bone mineral density. Alleviation in gastrointestinal 
      symptoms was observed, even though the patients reported no or only subtle 
      symptoms at diagnosis. Quality of life remained unchanged. Of all the cases, two 
      thirds would have been diagnosed even without screening if the family history, 
      fractures or concomitant autoimmune diseases had been taken carefully into 
      account. CONCLUSIONS: Screen-detected patients benefited from a gluten-free diet. 
      We encourage a high index of suspicion and active case-finding in celiac disease 
      as an alternative to mass screening in older patients.

TI  - Development of a patient reported outcome measure for fatigue in motor neurone 
      disease: the Neurological Fatigue Index (NFI-MND).
PG  - 101
LID - 10.1186/1477-7525-9-101 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this research was to develop a disease-specific 
      measure for fatigue in patients with motor neurone disease (MND) by generating 
      data that would fit the Rasch measurement model. Fatigue was defined as 
      reversible motor weakness and whole-body tiredness that was predominantly brought 
      on by muscular exertion and was partially relieved by rest. METHODS: Qualitative 
      interviews were undertaken to confirm the suitability of a previously identified 
      set of 52 neurological fatigue items as relevant to patients with MND. Patients 
      were recruited from five U.K. MND clinics. Questionnaires were administered 
      during clinic or by post. A sub-sample of patients completed the questionnaire 
      again after 2-4 weeks to assess test-retest validity. Exploratory factor analyses 
      and Rasch analysis were conducted on the item set. RESULTS: Qualitative 
      interviews with ten MND patients confirmed the suitability of 52 previously 
      identified neurological fatigue items as relevant to patients with MND. 298 
      patients consented to completing the initial questionnaire including this item 
      set, with an additional 78 patients completing the questionnaire a second time 
      after 4-6 weeks. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified five potential subscales 
      that could be conceptualised as representing: 'Energy', 'Reversible muscular 
      weakness' (shortened to 'Weakness'), 'Concentration', 'Effects of heat' and 
      'Rest'. Of the original five factors, two factors 'Energy' and 'Weakness' met the 
      expectations of the Rasch model. A higher order fatigue summary scale, consisting 
      of items from the 'Energy' and 'Weakness' subscales, was found to fit the Rasch 
      model and have acceptable unidimensionality. The two scales and the higher order 
      summary scale were shown to fulfil model expectations, including assumptions of 
      unidimensionality, local independency and an absence of differential item 
      functioning. CONCLUSIONS: The Neurological Fatigue Index for MND (NFI-MND) is a 
      simple, easy-to-administer fatigue scale. It consists of an 8-item fatigue 
      summary scale in addition to separate scales for measuring fatigue experienced as 
      reversible muscular weakness and fatigue expressed as feelings of low energy and 
      whole body tiredness. The underlying two factor structure supports the patient 
      concept of fatigue derived from qualitative interviews in this population. All 
      three scales were shown to be reliable and capable of interval level measurement.

PG  - 266-74
LID - 10.1016/j.brs.2010.12.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is one hallmark of major depression (MDD). It is distinguished 
      by lack of emotion, whereas other aspects of depression involve considerable 
      emotional distress. Investigating both apathy and depression may increase the 
      degree of treatment efficacy for both ailments together and apart. OBJECTIVE: 
      Evaluate the differential effects of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (DTMS) over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) on apathy and other aspects of depression 
      in patients suffering from a depressive episode. METHODS: Fifty-four 
      treatment-resistant MDD patients were evaluated with the Hamilton Rating Scale 
      for Depression (HRSD), and then treated with DTMS. Apathy-related items from HRSD 
      (ApHRSD) were compared with the remaining items from HRSD (DepHRSD). 
      Antidepressant medications were withdrawn and active DTMS treatment was 
      administered at 20 Hz, 5 days a week for 4 weeks. Changes in HRSD were recorded. 
      Primary efficacy time point was 1 week after the end of active treatment. 
      RESULTS: At screening, ApHRSD distribution was unimodal (moderate apathy), with 
      low correlation (r = 0.17) between ApHRSD and DepHRSD. After treatment, a third 
      had remitted apathy, and the correlation between ApHRSD and DepHRSD had 
      dramatically increased (r = 0.83). Severe ApHRSD (≥ 7) at screening correlated 
      with nonremission for both ApHRSD (R(2) = 0.1993, P = .0012) and DepHRSD (R(2) = 
      0.0860, P = .0334). CONCLUSIONS: DTMS over the PFC improved both apathy and 
      depression similarly. However, DTMS did not lead to MDD remission if ApHRSD at 
      screening was ≥ 7 of 12. Further investigation using a larger sample will 
      determine whether screening apathy at baseline could be used to predict efficacy 
      of DTMS in MDD patients.

TI  - Post-stroke fatigue.
PG  - 341-4
AB  - Post-stroke fatigue is still a relatively unexplored, often neglected condition. 
      The fatigue often manifests as physical and mental lack of energy, and many 
      patients mention fatigue as one of the most difficult sequels to which they have 
      to adjust. Our aim was to assess the fatigue in 35 three-month post-stroke 
      patients and its relation to personal and stroke-related factors, and to compare 
      them with 35 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. The main outcome 
      measures for the fatigue were Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Multidimensional 
      Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20). Barthel index was used for functional status 
      assessment, while anxiety and depressive symptoms were evaluated using Hospital 
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Study results showed fatigue to be frequent 
      (45%) and often severe. Post-stroke patients showed higher values of general 
      fatigue dimensions, physical fatigue and reduced activity. The number of subjects 
      reporting fatigue problems on the FSS and MFI-20 scales was significantly greater 
      in the stroke group (16/35; 45%) than in the control group (4/35; 11%; chi2 = 
      12.5; P < 0.001). Considering associations between fatigue and Barthel index 
      score, age, sex, HADS-A (anxiety) and HADS-D (depression) scores, statistically 
      significant associations were recorded between fatigue and anxiety (P = 0.01) and 
      depression symptoms (P = 0.02). Global fatigue showed positive correlation with 
      Barthel index score too (P = 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that anxiety and 
      depression symptoms could predict post-stroke fatigue (adjusted R2 = 0.556; P < 
      0.05). Clinical trials and follow-up studies to find an effective treatment for 
      patients with post-stroke fatigue are warranted.

TI  - Dementia with Lewy bodies is associated with higher scores on the Geriatric 
      Depression Scale than is Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 157-65
LID - 10.1111/j.1479-8301.2011.00368.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several reports suggest a higher morbidity of depression in patients 
      with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) than in patients with Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD). However, these results have not been duplicated consistently. The 
      psychiatric symptoms of dementia, including depression, are important for its 
      diagnosis and management. Thus, the aim of the present study was to clarify the 
      characteristics of the depressive symptoms in DLB compared with AD using the 
      Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). METHODS: We examined the GDS score for 86 
      patients with probable DLB (based on the Consensus Criteria for the clinical 
      diagnosis of DLB) and 86 patients with probable AD (based on criteria of the 
      National Institute for Neurological and Communicative Disorders and 
      Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association), who were matched 
      according to age, sex, education, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 
      scores. We also examined correlations between GDS scores and age, sex, or MMSE 
      scores in both groups. Correlations between GDS scores and 
      metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy were examined in patients with DLB. 
      To characterize the GDS in DLB, its profile was examined using factor structures. 
      RESULTS: Scores for DLB patients were twice as high on the GDS as those for AD 
      patients. There was no correlation between GDS score and age, sex, or MMSE scores 
      in either group. Furthermore, there was no correlation between the results of 
      MIBG scintigraphy and GDS scores in the DLB group. Using factor structures, the 
      depression symptom profile of these diseases suggested that depression-specific 
      symptoms, such as mood, worry, or future outlook, were more frequent in the DLB 
      group than non-specific symptoms, such as lack of energy, decreased 
      concentration, or apathy. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that depressive symptoms 
      are highly specific symptoms of DLB, independent of other features of this 
      disorder. The GDS could be used as a subsidiary tool in differentiating DLB from 
      AD and is more useful than clinical observations of depression.

TI  - Depression in Alzheimer's disease: specificity of depressive symptoms using three 
      different clinical criteria.
PG  - 944-51
LID - 10.1002/gps.2631 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies report contradictory results on whether the symptoms 
      of depression in Alzheimer's disease patients are the same as in cognitively 
      normal persons. Thus, provisional criteria for depression in Alzheimer's disease 
      (PDC-dAD) have been developed. AIM: To examine which symptoms in AD patients are 
      significant in diagnosing depression according to PDC-dAD compared to those for 
      the DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 criteria. METHODS: We included 112 patients with 
      Alzheimer's disease. They were interviewed by a psychiatrist who diagnosed 
      depression according to PDC-dAD, DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10. Without knowledge of that 
      diagnosis, trained nurses interviewed the caregivers of the patients using the 
      Cornell scale for depression in dementia (CSDD). RESULTS: Mean age of the 
      patients was 83.0 (s.d. 7.9), 77 (69.6%) were female. The proportion with 
      depression according to each set of criteria was: PDC-dAD 53.5%, ICD-10, 47.3% 
      and DSM-IV-TR, 34.8%. Sadness, loss of interest and agitation/retardation were 
      the most prevalent symptoms in depressed subjects as evaluated by the 
      psychiatrists. According to CSDD sadness, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, poor 
      self-esteem, multiple physical complaints and pessimism best distinguished the 
      depressed patients from the non-depressed. In multiple logistic regression 
      analyses poor self-esteem, delusion and multiple physical complaints best 
      predicted depression using PDC-dAD criteria, whereas sadness, suicidal thoughts 
      and poor self-esteem best predicted depression using ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR. 
      CONCLUSION: The most significant symptoms for a depressive disorder in AD are 
      pretty much the same as for patients without dementia using the DSM-IV-TR and 
      ICD-10 criteria, whereas they differ using the PDC-dAD criteria.

      analysis.
PG  - 444-54
LID - 10.1177/1557988311408410 [doi]
AB  - Depression can be a pathway to older men's suicide, yet the mechanisms by which 
      this can occur are poorly understood. A qualitative study of 22 older men who 
      self-identified or were formally diagnosed with depression was conducted to 
      describe the connections between masculinity, depression, and suicide. Analyses 
      of individual interviews revealed that cumulative losses around social bonds were 
      central to older men's depression, apathy for living, and thoughts about suicide. 
      Prominent were men's self-assessments of failing to fulfill breadwinner roles, 
      judgments that led participants to ruminate on their shortcomings amid 
      recognizing their older age as limiting opportunities for redemption. Stigma 
      featured as a barrier for men acting on their suicidal thoughts, and guilt about 
      the pain their suicide would evoke on family and friends was a strong deterrent 
      for men's self-harm. Overall, participants' alignment to masculine ideals 
      influenced both the connectedness and detachment between older men's depression 
      and suicide.

TI  - Midlife motivational abilities predict apathy and depression in Alzheimer 
      disease: the aging, demographics, and memory study.
PG  - 151-60

AB  - Apathy and depression are the most common neuropsychiatric symptoms in mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD). This study was the first 
      to explore midlife motivational abilities as a predictor of the progression of 
      apathy and depression in MCI and AD. It used a subsample of the Aging, 
      Demographics, and Memory Study (N = 137). Participants, aged over 70, were 
      categorized according to baseline clinical diagnosis (normal cognition, MCI, or 
      AD). Assessments were conducted at an 18-month interval. Neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Midlife motivational 
      abilities were estimated on the basis of the main occupation using the 
      Occupational Information Network (O*NET) database, which provides detailed 
      information on worker abilities. Repeated measures analysis of covariance was 
      used. Apathy and depression were found to be particularly high in participants 
      with AD and high motivational abilities. Apathy, but not depression, increased 
      over time in those with AD and high motivational abilities. It would appear that 
      holding on to unattainable goals with strong motivational efforts when faced with 
      severe cognitive loss might lead to unproductive persistence, depressive 
      reaction, and more apathetic behavior.

      Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 2051-7
LID - 10.1002/mds.23792 [doi]
AB  - Hyposmia, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive problems are common nonmotor 
      manifestations in Parkinson's disease, but how they are related remains unclear. 
      We investigated the relationship between olfactory dysfunction and 
      neuropsychiatric manifestations and performed a cross-sectional study of 248 
      patients at two movement disorders clinics at academic medical centers. 
      Psychiatric measures were the Geriatric Depression Scale-15, Inventory of 
      Depressive Symptomatology, State Anxiety Inventory, Apathy Scale, and Parkinson's 
      Psychosis Rating Scale. Cognitive measures were the Mini-Mental State 
      Examination, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Digit Span, Tower of 
      London-Drexel, and the Stroop Color Word Test. Olfaction was tested with the 
      University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. There was no significant 
      association between olfaction and mood measures, but psychotic symptoms were more 
      common in patients with olfaction scores below the median (30% vs. 12%; P < 
      0.001). Worse olfaction was associated with poorer memory (Hopkins Verbal 
      Learning Test-Revised delayed recall items: mean [standard deviation], 6.2 [3.2] 
      vs. 8.4 [2.8]; P < 0.001) and executive performance (Tower of London total moves, 
      52 [38] vs. 34 [21]; P < 0.001). Odor-identification score was a significant 
      predictor of abnormal performance on these cognitive tests after adjustment for 
      age, sex, and disease characteristics in logistic regression models. The 
      relationship between hyposmia, psychosis, and specific cognitive impairments may 
      reflect the anatomic distribution of Lewy pathology and suggests that olfactory 
      dysfunction could be a biomarker of additional extranigral disease. Future 
      prospective studies are warranted to assess whether hyposmia, a very early 
      feature of Parkinson's disease, might be used to predict the appearance of other 
      common nonmotor symptoms.

TI  - Predictors of depression among older people living in rural areas of Thailand.
PG  - 51-6
AB  - Global population is ageing and Thailand has one of the fastest growing ageing 
      populations in this region. Combined with this, depression has become a major 
      mental health problem for older people. The objective of this paper is to examine 
      the predictors of depression among rural older people of Thailand. This study has 
      used information from the Study on Health and Social Support among Older 
      Population living in Kanchanaburi Demographic Surveillance System (KDSS), 
      Thailand in 2006. Depression was measured by a 12 item questionnaire of Thai 
      validated Euro-D scale among 1001 respondents. The questions were on depression, 
      pessimism, wishing to die, guilt, sleep disturbance, loss of interest, 
      irritability, eating problems, fatigue, problem in concentration, lack of 
      enjoyment, and tearfulness. Among the respondents 28.5% had depression. The 
      results of logistic regression found that infirmity, disability and serious life 
      events had significant effect on depression of the respondent. Those who had 4 or 
      more infirmity, they were 2.08 times more likely to have depression compare to 
      those who had no or only 1 infirmity. Disability was another strong predictor of 
      the depression. It should be mentioned here that those who had medium disability, 
      had the chance of depression 3.12 times more compare to those who had no 
      disability. Serious life event was also a major factor for the respondents. Those 
      who had 3 or more serious life events they had the depression 5.25 times more 
      compare to those who had no serious life event.This study identified three major 
      predictors of depression for older people in KDSS, Thailand. The finding will 
      help to design specific prevention program to reduce the depression of older 
      people living in the rural area of Thailand.

TI  - Psychometric properties of the Spanish QoL-AD with institutionalized dementia 
      patients and their family caregivers in Spain.
PG  - 775-83
LID - 10.1080/13607863.2011.562183 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the psychometric attributes of the Spanish version of the 
      Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QoL-AD) in institutionalized patients 
      and family caregivers in Spain. METHOD: 101 patients (88.1% women; mean age, 83.2 
       ±  6.3) with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 82) and mixed dementia (n = 19) and 
      their closest family caregivers. Patient-related variables included severity of 
      dementia, cognitive status, perceived general health, quality of life, behavior, 
      apathy, depression, and functional status. QoL-AD acceptability, reliability, and 
      construct validity were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean Mini-Mental State Examination 
      (MMSE) score was 7.2  ±  6.1 and Global Deterioration Scale was: stage four (4%); 
      five (21.2%); six (34.3%); and seven (40.4%). Both, QoL-AD patient version 
      (QoL-ADp) (n = 40; MMSE = 12.0  ±  4.5) and QoL-AD caregiver version (QoL-ADc) 
      (n = 101) lacked significant floor and ceiling effects and the Cronbach α index 
      was 0.90 and 0.86, respectively. The corrected item-total correlation was 
      0.11-0.68 (QoL-ADc) and 0.28-0.84 (QoL-ADp). Stability was satisfactory for 
      QoL-ADp (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=0.83) but low for QoL-ADc 
      (ICC = 0.51); the standard error of measurement was 2.72 and 4.69. Construct 
      validity was moderate/high for QoL-ADc (QUALID=-0.43; EQ-5D = 0.65), but lower 
      for QoL-ADp. No significant correlations were observed between QoL-ADp and 
      patient variables or QoL-ADc. A low to high association (r = 0.18-0.55) was 
      obtained between QoL-ADc and patient-related measures of neuropsychiatric, 
      function, and cognitive status. CONCLUSION: Differences in their psychometric 
      attributes, and discrepancy between them, were found for QoL-ADp and QoL-ADc. In 
      patients with AD and advanced dementia, the QoL perceived by the patient could be 
      based on a construct that is different from the traditional QoL construct.

TI  - Do the GDS and the GDS-15 adequately capture the range of depressive symptoms 
      among older residents in congregate housing?
PG  - 950-60
LID - 10.1017/S1041610210002425 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In light of inconsistencies in cut points for identifying non-major 
      depression, this study examined the classification efficiency of the Geriatric 
      Depression Scale (GDS and GDS-15) total scores and individual items, and four 
      additional depressive symptoms for identification of subthreshold, minor, or 
      criterion depression among 166 vulnerable residents of congregate housing. 
      METHODS: Depression (combined categories of major depressive episode, minor, or 
      subthreshold depression) was determined by the Mini-International 
      Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) diagnostic interview depression module 
      administered by telephone to 166 older residents of congregate housing facilities 
      who also completed the 30-item GDS and four other yes/no potential indicators of 
      geriatric depression. Classification agreement and ROC curve analysis for the 
      full and 15-item GDS scale scores were calculated. Individual item hit rates for 
      MINI criterion were calculated for GDS items and four new items. RESULTS: GDS and 
      GDS-15 at standard cut points had 70-75% agreement with MINI. Best sensitivity 
      and specificity were obtained at lower than standard cut points. Some GDS 
      Withdrawal, Apathy, lack of Vigor (WAV) and cognitive items obtained very low hit 
      rates. New items "I just don't feel like myself" and "I feel I am a burden to 
      others" better discriminated MINI depression than most GDS items and had good 
      item-to-total correlations with the GDS. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic criteria and GDS 
      screen had partial agreement. Some GDS items did not adequately represent 
      depression among functionally impaired or oldest old older adults. Feeling one is 
      a burden and the sense of feeling "different" from usual may be useful indicators 
      of depression among vulnerable older adults.

      rural regions. Results of the 10/66 Dementia Research Group in Mexico].
PG  - 382-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe, in a Mexican sample of urban and rural residents older 
      than 65 years, with and without dementia, the frequency and severity of 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This work is part of the 
      multi-center, epidemiological study carried out by the 10/66 Dementia Research 
      Group, with 1,003 subjects from an urban region and 1,000 subjects from a rural 
      region. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed with the abbreviated version of 
      the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Q). RESULTS: Eighty six and eighty five 
      dementia cases were found in the urban and rural regions, respectively. Subjects 
      with dementia were more frequently widows, older and less educated, and the ones 
      from the rural region had fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms, compared to the urban 
      region. In both regions all symptoms were more severe in subjects with dementia. 
      A high frequency of affective symptoms (depression and apathy specially) was 
      observed, and irritability and anxiety in second term. The caregiver stress 
      levels were associated with the frequency and severity of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This is the first study reporting neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with 
      dementia identified by means of culturally validated and population based 
      diagnostic criteria, in Mexican residents of urban and rural settings.

TI  - Burnout levels and self-rated health prospectively predict future long-term 
      sickness absence: a study among female health professionals.
PG  - 788-93
LID - 10.1097/JOM.0b013e318222b1dc [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the predictive validity of the Oldenburg 
      Burnout Inventory (OLBI), and of three health indicators (depression, anxiety, 
      and self-rated health), for long-term sickness absence (LTSA). METHODS: 
      Questionnaires were sent to all employees in a Swedish County Council (N = 6118), 
      and the overall response rate was 65% (N = 3976). As 82% were women, only women 
      were included in the study. Certified LTSA data were collected. RESULTS: Logistic 
      regression analyses showed that high scores on exhaustion, depression, and poor 
      self-rated health increased the risk of future LTSA (≥90 days). Support for the 
      proposed two-factorial structure of the OLBI was found, including the dimensions 
      of exhaustion and disengagement from work. CONCLUSION: Using burnout measures 
      might be useful to identify those at risk for LTSA, and to enable preventive 
      solutions in organizations.

TI  - General and disease-specific quality of life in patients with chronic suppurative 
      otitis media--a prospective study.
PG  - 48
LID - 10.1186/1477-7525-9-48 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is frequently associated with 
      symptoms of inflammation like discharge from the ear or pain. In many cases, 
      patients suffer from hearing loss causing communication problems and social 
      withdrawal. The objective of this work was to collect prospective audiological 
      data and data on general and disease-specific quality of life with validated 
      quality of life measurement instruments to assess the impact of the disease on 
      health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). METHODS: 121 patients were included in 
      the study. Patients were clinically examined in the hospital before and 6 months 
      after surgery including audiological testing. They filled in the quality of life 
      questionnaires SF-36 and Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 (COMOT-15) 
      pre-operatively and 6 and 12 months post-operatively, respectively. RESULTS: 
      Complete data records from 90 patients were available for statistical analysis. 
      Disease-specific HR-QOL in patients with CSOM improved after tympanoplasty in all 
      the scales of the COMOT-15. There was no difference in HR-QOL assessment between 
      patients with mesotympanic respectively epitympanic CSOM. However, we did find 
      the outcome to be worse in patients who received revision surgery compared with 
      those receiving primary surgery. Audiometric findings correlated very well with 
      the subscale hearing function from the COMOT-15 questionnaire. General HR-QOL 
      measured with the SF-36 was not significantly changed by tympanoplasty. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Tympanoplasty did lead to a significant improvement of 
      disease-specific HR-QOL in patients with CSOM while general HR-QOL did not 
      change. Very well correlations were found between the subscale hearing function 
      from the COMOT-15 questionnaire and audiological findings. Revision surgery seems 
      to be a predictor for a worse outcome.

TI  - Concise Associated Symptoms Tracking scale: a brief self-report and clinician 
      rating of symptoms associated with suicidality.
PG  - 765-74
LID - 10.4088/JCP.11m06840 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warnings recommend monitoring 
      negative symptoms associated with the initiation of antidepressant medications as 
      these symptoms may interfere with full recovery and pose safety concerns. There 
      is currently no brief, reliable rating instrument for assessing 
      treatment-emergent, negative symptoms. We evaluated the psychometric properties 
      of 2 versions of the newly developed 17-item Concise Associated Symptom Tracking 
      (CAST) scale, the CAST Clinician Rating (CAST-C) and CAST Self-Rated (CAST-SR), 
      which are brief instruments designed to measure the 5 relevant associated symptom 
      domains (irritability, anxiety, mania, insomnia, and panic). METHOD: The study 
      enrolled 265 outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD), from July 2007 
      through February 2008, into an 8-week, open-label trial with a selective 
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Diagnosis of MDD was determined by the Psychiatric 
      Diagnostic Screening questionnaire and an MDD checklist based on DSM-IV-TR 
      criteria. Suicidality (suicidal ideation with associated behaviors) is 1 of 9 
      symptoms of MDD (depressed mood, loss of interest, appetite or weight change, 
      sleep disturbance, reduced concentration or indecisiveness, fatigue or decreased 
      energy, psychomotor agitation or retardation, feelings of worthlessness or 
      excessive guilt). Psychometric evaluations were conducted on both versions of the 
      CAST. RESULTS: Cronbach α was .80 (CAST-C) and .81 (CAST-SR). Factor analysis 
      identified 5 factors for each scale: (1) irritability, (2) anxiety, (3) mania, 
      (4) insomnia, and (5) panic. When the item that cross-loaded on 2 factors was 
      eliminated, the 16-item solution had a better goodness of fit (CAST-C: 0.90 vs 
      0.87; CAST-SR: 0.88 vs 0.84). Cronbach α for the 16-item versions was .77 
      (CAST-C) and .78 (CAST-SR). The 5 associated CAST symptom domains correlated well 
      with other standard measures of these domains. CONCLUSIONS: The 16-item CAST-C 
      and CAST-SR demonstrated excellent psychometric properties. These are potentially 
      useful measures for monitoring treatment-emergent negative symptoms associated 
      with antidepressants, as recommended by the FDA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00532103.

TI  - [Prefrontal symptoms assessment: psychometric properties and normative data of 
      the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX) in a sample from the Spanish population].
PG  - 394-404
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Research on the deficits derived from alterations in the prefrontal 
      circuits has been conducted almost exclusively from a categorical perspective, 
      which differentiates normal from pathological functioning. The functioning of the 
      prefrontal cortex, however, can be seen as a continuous dimension. The 
      Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX) was created with the intention of being useful 
      as a qualitative measure of the symptoms of 'dysexecutive syndrome' in day-to-day 
      life. AIM. To explore the psychometric properties of the self-reported DEX in a 
      broad sample of the non-clinical population with a view to providing 
      interpretations that can be of use in clinical practice. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 
      The Spanish version of the DEX was administered to 1013 non-clinical individuals 
      living in Madrid, Saragossa, Asturias, Navarre and Seville (380 males and 633 
      females). RESULTS: The factorial study conducted in parallel reveals the 
      existence of two factors with adequate consistency and internal validity indices: 
      items that explore difficulties in beginning, maintaining and organising 
      behaviour (disorganisation/apathy) and items related with the interruption of 
      behaviour in situations where it is inappropriate (disinhibition/impulsivity). 
      The distribution according to age matches the developmental premises. The 
      following cut-off points are proposed: < 10, optimal functioning; 10-18, 
      sub-optimal functioning within normality; 19-28, moderately dysexecutive 
      functioning that requires identification of the possible causes, and > 28, 
      important degree of dysexecutive disorder that would include severe pathologies. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The DEX may be useful as an instrument for detecting subjects with 
      demonstrable brain disorders and those with deficient executive functioning 
      without the presence of any known or identifiable pathology.

TI  - Assessment of social anxiety in first episode psychosis using the Liebowitz 
      Social Anxiety scale as a self-report measure.
PG  - 115-21
LID - 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2010.08.014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social anxiety is a common problem in psychotic disorders. The 
      Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, Self-Rating version (LSAS-SR) is a widely used 
      instrument to capture different aspects of social anxiety, but its psychometric 
      properties have not been tested in this patient group. The aims of the present 
      study were to evaluate the psychometric properties of the LSAS-SR in patients 
      with first episode psychosis, to investigate whether it differentiated between 
      active and passive social withdrawal and to test which clinical factors 
      contributed to current level of social anxiety. METHOD: A total of 144 first 
      episode psychosis patients from the ongoing Thematically Organized Psychosis 
      (TOP) study were included at the time of first treatment. Diagnoses were set 
      according to the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID-1) for DSM-IV. A factor 
      analysis was carried out and the relationship of social anxiety to psychotic and 
      general symptomatology measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
      (PANSS) was evaluated. Possible contributors to social anxiety were analyzed 
      using multiple hierarchic regression analysis. RESULTS: The factor analysis 
      identified three subscales: public performance, social interaction and 
      observation. All three subscales showed satisfactory psychometric properties, 
      acceptable convergent and discriminate properties, and confirmed previous 
      findings in social anxiety samples. Self-esteem explained a significant amount of 
      the variance in social anxiety, even after adjusting for the effects of 
      delusions, suspiciousness and depression. CONCLUSION: The study shows that the 
      LSAS-SR can be used in this patient group, that social anxiety is strongly 
      related to both behavioral social avoidance and to self-esteem. The results 
      support the use of this measure in assessment of social anxiety in both clinical 
      settings and in research.

TI  - Predicting functional decline in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia.
PG  - 432-48
LID - 10.1093/brain/awq348 [doi]
AB  - Behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia is characterized by a change in 
      comportment. It is associated with considerable functional decline over the 
      course of the illness albeit with sometimes dramatic variability among patients. 
      It is unknown whether any baseline features, or combination of features, could 
      predict rate of functional decline in behavioural variant frontotemporal 
      dementia. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different 
      baseline clinical, neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, genetic and anatomic 
      predictors on the rate of functional decline as measured by the Clinical Dementia 
      Rating Sum of Boxes scale. We identified 86 subjects with behavioural variant 
      frontotemporal dementia that had multiple serial Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of 
      Boxes assessments (mean 4, range 2-18). Atlas-based parcellation was used to 
      generate volumes for specific regions of interest at baseline. Volumes were 
      utilized to classify subjects into different anatomical subtypes using the 
      advanced statistical technique of cluster analysis and were assessed as predictor 
      variables. Composite scores were generated for the neuropsychological domains of 
      executive, language, memory and visuospatial function. Behaviours from the brief 
      questionnaire form of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory were assessed. Linear 
      mixed-effects regression modelling was used to determine which baseline features 
      predict rate of future functional decline. Rates of functional decline differed 
      across the anatomical subtypes of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, 
      with faster rates observed in the frontal dominant and frontotemporal subtypes. 
      In addition, subjects with poorer performance on neuropsychological tests of 
      executive, language and visuospatial function, less disinhibition, 
      agitation/aggression and night-time behaviours at presentation, and smaller 
      medial, lateral and orbital frontal lobe volumes showed faster rates of decline. 
      In many instances, the effect of the predictor variables observed across all 
      subjects was also preserved within anatomical subtypes. Furthermore, some of the 
      predictor variables improved our prediction of rate of functional decline after 
      anatomical subtype was taken into account. In particular, age at onset was a 
      highly significant predictor but only after adjusting for subtype. We also found 
      that although some predictor variables, for example gender, Mini-Mental State 
      Examination score, and apathy/indifference, did not affect the rate of functional 
      decline; these variables were associated with the actual Clinical Dementia Rating 
      Sum of Boxes score estimated for any given time-point. These findings suggest 
      that in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, rate of functional decline 
      is driven by the combination of anatomical pattern of atrophy, age at onset, and 
      neuropsychiatric characteristics of the subject at baseline.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current study examined how goal engagement and two coping 
      strategies (self-blame and denial) hypothesized to prevent successful 
      disengagement relate to affective well-being among adults with a functional 
      disability. METHOD: Ninety-nine community-dwelling adults (23 to 76 years old, 66 
      men) with spinal cord injury participated in structured interviews assessing 
      affective well-being using the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (Watson, Clark, 
      & Tellegen, 1988); goal engagement using a modified version of the Optimization, 
      Primary, and Secondary Control Scale (Heckhausen, Schulz, & Wrosch, 1998); and 
      self-blame and denial using items from Carver's (1997) Brief COPE Inventory. 
      RESULTS: Greater goal engagement was significantly associated with positive but 
      not negative affect. Greater use of self-blame and denial coping was associated 
      with lower positive affect for older adults and higher negative affect across the 
      age range.

TI  - Diagnostic criteria for apathy in clinical practice.
PG  - 158-65
LID - 10.1002/gps.2508 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is an important and distressing behavioural symptom in 
      Alzheimer's disease and in various neuropsychiatric disorders. Recently, 
      diagnostic criteria for apathy have been proposed. OBJECTIVES: In groups of 
      patients suffering from different neuropsychiatric diseases, (i) to estimate the 
      prevalence of patients meeting the proposed diagnostic criteria; (ii) to estimate 
      the concurrent validity of the criteria with the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) 
      apathy item; (iii) to identify the most frequently met criteria or sub-criteria 
      in each specific neuropsychiatric disease and (iv) to estimate the inter-observer 
      reliability of the diagnostic criteria for apathy. METHODS: This cross-sectional, 
      multicentric, observational study was performed on 306 patients. Each of the 
      participating centres had to check the presence of apathy according to the 
      diagnostic criteria for apathy in consecutive patients belonging to the following 
      diagnoses list: Alzheimer disease (AD), mixed dementia, mild cognitive impairment 
      (MCI), Parkinson's disease (PD), Schizophrenia (DSM-IV) and major depressive 
      episode. In addition to the clinical interview, the assessment included the Mini 
      Mental Score Examination (MMSE) and the NPI. At the end of the visit, clinicians 
      were required to check the diagnostic criteria for apathy. RESULTS: Using the 
      diagnostic criteria for apathy, the frequency of apathy was of 53% in the whole 
      population, 55% in AD, 70% in mixed dementia, 43% in MCI, 27% in PD, 53% in 
      schizophrenia and 94% in major depressive episode. In AD, mixed dementia, MCI and 
      PD, the NPI apathy score was significantly higher for patient fulfilling the 
      apathy criteria. Goal-directed cognitive activity (criteria B2-Cognition) was the 
      most frequently observed domain followed by goal-directed behaviour (criteria 
      B1-Behaviour) and emotion (criteria B3), respectively. Inter-rater reliability 
      was high for the overall diagnostic (κ coefficient = 0.93; p = 0.0001) and for 
      each criteria. CONCLUSION: This study is the first one to test the diagnostic 
      criteria for apathy in clinical practice. Results make the diagnostic criteria 
      useful for clinical practice and research.

TI  - [Diagnosis and assessment of psychopathological symptoms in Parkinson's disease].
PG  - 679-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease(PD) is a multidimensional disorder characterized 
      primarily by motor symptoms, but often accompanied by non-motor symptoms, 
      including psychopathological and autonomic symptoms. AIM: To provide an overview 
      of current knowledge concerning the diagnosis, assessment and epidemiology of a 
      number of psychopathological syndromes in PD. METHODS: Relevant literature is 
      discussed. RESULTS: Depressive disorders, apathy, anxiety, cognitive impairment 
      and hallucinations are all common in PD . For most of these syndromes, there is 
      consensus regarding diagnostic criteria, and reliable rating scales are 
      available. In general, an inclusive approach is recommended, which means that 
      without interpretation or attribution, all symptoms present contribute to a 
      psychopathological diagnosis. All psychopathological syndromes are more common in 
      the hypokinetic rigid subtype of the disease. CONCLUSION: The recognition and 
      treatment of psychopathological symptoms in PD require specific expertise. In the 
      treatment of pd patients, therefore, it is essential that there should be 
      multidisciplinary collaboration between the neurologist, the neuropsychologist 
      and the psychiatrist.

TI  - Key concepts of migraine postdrome: a qualitative study to develop a 
      post-migraine questionnaire.
PG  - 105-17
LID - 10.1111/j.1526-4610.2010.01817.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand migraine postdrome by directly interviewing migraine 
      patients with postdrome symptoms. To document these symptoms, as well as impacts, 
      as a prelude to developing a postdrome migraine questionnaire. BACKGROUND: 
      Migraine attacks are traditionally divided into 4 phases. Of these, the postdrome 
      is the least studied, and no patient-reported outcomes to assess symptoms and 
      impacts of this migraine phase have been published. METHODS: Qualitative concept 
      elicitation focus groups were conducted with 34 patients in 3 geographically 
      diverse US cities to elicit the symptoms and burden of migraine postdrome. Data 
      elicited from focus groups were coded using Atlas.ti software to facilitate 
      identification of concepts and terminologies of migraine postdrome. A draft 
      questionnaire was developed based on the symptoms and impacts of migraine 
      postdrome described by patients. Cognitive debriefing interviews were conducted 
      with 15 patients in Connecticut and Chicago to confirm content validity, 
      relevance, and comprehension. RESULTS: Patients defined the onset of postdrome as 
      when they no longer experienced the migraine pain. Postdrome was often described 
      as "[being] or [feeling] wiped out" and "headache hangover." The symptoms most 
      frequently reported by the patients who participated in the focus groups and 
      included in the draft post-migraine questionnaire were: tiredness, difficulty 
      concentrating, weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, and decreased energy. 
      Patients also reported decreased activity level as a result of experiencing 
      postdrome symptoms. Postdrome symptoms were reported to impact the ability to 
      work, to affect family interactions and social life, and to cause cognitive 
      impairment. A preliminary questionnaire measuring severity and duration of 
      symptoms and severity of impacts of the post-migraine experience, with an 
      11-point (0 to 10) response scale, was developed. This preliminary questionnaire 
      was tested for content validity, relevance, and comprehension using cognitive 
      debriefing interviews. All patients reported that the questionnaire was relevant 
      to their condition. Irrelevant and redundant items such as body tension and 
      annoyance were eliminated. CONCLUSIONS: Migraine postdrome is debilitating for 
      those who experience it. Concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing research 
      support the relevance of the items in the post-migraine questionnaire. Future 
      research will provide evidence of the post-migraine questionnaire's psychometric 
      properties and interpretation guidelines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge about sexuality in elderly persons is limited, and 
      normative data are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of older men 
      who are sexually active and to explore factors predictive of sexual activity. 
      DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Community-dwelling men from 
      Perth, Western Australia, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 3274 men aged 75 to 95 years. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Questionnaires from 1996 to 1999, 2001 to 2004, and 2008 to 2009 
      assessed social and medical factors. Sex hormones were measured from 2001 to 
      2004. Sexual activity was assessed by questionnaire from 2008 to 2009. RESULTS: A 
      total of 2783 men (85.0%) provided data on sexual activity. Sex was considered at 
      least somewhat important by 48.8% (95% CI, 47.0% to 50.6%), and 30.8% (CI, 29.1% 
      to 32.5%) had had at least 1 sexual encounter in the past 12 months. Of the 
      latter, 56.5% were satisfied with the frequency of activity, whereas 43.0% had 
      sex less often than preferred. In cross-sectional analyses, increasing age, 
      partner's lack of interest, partner's physical limitations, osteoporosis, 
      prostate cancer, diabetes, antidepressant use, and β-blocker use were 
      independently associated with reduced odds of sexual activity. Living with a 
      partner and having a non-English-speaking background were associated with 
      increased odds. In longitudinal analyses, higher testosterone levels were 
      associated with increased odds of being sexually active. Other factors were 
      similar to the cross-sectional model. LIMITATIONS: Response bias may have 
      influenced findings because sexuality can be a sensitive topic. Attrition may 
      have resulted in a healthier-than-average sample of older men. CONCLUSION: One 
      half of elderly men consider sex important, and one third report being sexually 
      active. Men's health problems were associated with lack of sexual activity. Key 
      modifiable risk factors include diabetes, depression, and medication use. 
      Endogenous testosterone levels predict sexual activity, but the role of 
      testosterone therapy remains uncertain. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Health

PG  - 656-60
LID - 10.1016/j.parkreldis.2010.08.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome in Parkinson's Disease 
      (PD) that affects quality of life. Research into apathy has been hampered by a 
      lack of broadly accepted diagnostic criteria. Recently, diagnostic criteria for 
      apathy in neuropsychiatric disorders have been proposed, which to date have not 
      been validated in PD. AIM: To validate the proposed diagnostic criteria for 
      apathy in PD. DESIGN AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, outpatients with PD 
      visiting a movement disorders clinic underwent a protocolized assessment of motor 
      function, activities of daily living (ADL), cognition and mood. In addition, the 
      diagnostic criteria for apathy were administered as well as two apathy rating 
      instruments: the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) and the apathy section of the 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). RESULTS: Of the included patients 17.2% were 
      diagnosed with apathy according to the criteria. Acceptability and internal 
      consistency of the criteria was good, as was the concurrent validity with the 
      LARS and apathy section of the NPI. Discriminant validity of the criteria with 
      depression was moderate to good. All domains of criterion B (behavior, cognition, 
      emotion) contributed to the diagnosis of apathy, of which reduced goal-directed 
      behavior was the most frequently observed symptom. CONCLUSION: The recently 
      proposed diagnostic criteria for apathy are useful in clinical practice and in 
      research with PD patients with and without cognitive impairment.

AB  - Recently, several instruments have been developed to measure the subjective 
      component of the quality of life (QOL) of people with profound intellectual and 
      multiple disabilities (PIMD). A next step, however, must be the further 
      validation of these instruments. The present study aimed at evaluating the 
      psychometric properties of one of these instruments, the Dutch version of the 
      Mood, Interest and Pleasure Questionnaire (MIPQ). The MIPQ is a 25-item Likert 
      scale questionnaire with two subscales (Mood and Interest and Pleasure). The MIPQ 
      and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist were completed on 360 participants with 
      severe or profound intellectual disabilities. About 27% of these participants 
      were included in an examination of test-retest of and the inter-rater reliability 
      of the MIPQ. The results suggest that the proposed two-factor structure did not 
      show an adequate fit to our data. An exploratory factor analysis revealed a 
      three-factor structure with positive mood, negative mood and interest as three 
      correlated but distinct subscales. These results are in concurrence with the 
      literature on positive emotions. High internal consistency (α ≥ .80), high 
      inter-rater (r ≥ .69) and high test-retest reliability (r ≥ .86) were found, 
      which indicates the reliable use of the MIPQ in the population of people with 
      PIMD. Strong negative correlations between the MIPQ total score and the Aberant 
      Behavior Checklist's 'lethargy, social withdrawal' subscale provides some 
      evidence of the construct validity of the MIPQ. However, further validation of 
      the MIPQ including other measures of subjective well-being is warranted.

TI  - Estimated prevalence of fatigue following stroke and transient ischemic attack is 
      dependent on terminology used and patient gender.
PG  - 431-4
LID - 10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2009.07.017 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of fatigue following stroke and Transient Ischaemic 
      Attack (TIA) is disputed, with prevalences ranging from 30% to 72% reported. We 
      hypothesized that methods and descriptors used may substantially affect the 
      prevalence reported. METHODS: Subjects completed validated assessments of fatigue 
      and sleepiness (the Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS] and Epworth Sleepiness Scale 
      [ESS]) as well as 5-point Likert scores on frequency of symptoms using the 5 
      statements of fatigue derived from patient interviews. RESULTS: Among the 91 
      subjects, the mean FSS score was 3.8. FSS score correlated more strongly with the 
      statement "I have a lack of energy" (r=0.470; ρ<0.001; Spearman's rho) than with 
      the statement "I feel physical fatigue" (r=0.349; ρ=0.001). The statement "I have 
      a lack of energy" also produced the highest prevalence of severe symptoms, with 
      37% agreeing that they had the symptom "often" or "always." Agreement between 
      Likert scales was only fair, the best being that for "I have a lack of energy" 
      and "I feel physical fatigue" (κ=0.50). There was a gender difference in simple 
      expression of fatigue, with the statement "I feel physical fatigue" correlating 
      strongly with FSS score in males (r=0.61; ρ<0.001) but not correlating in females 
      (r=0.039; ρ=0.29). Depending on which definition of fatigue was used, the 
      prevalence of fatigue varied between 13% and 63%. FSS score correlated weakly 
      with ESS score (r=0.287; ρ=0.008). Our data indicate significant variation in the 
      prevalence of fatigue among subjects with stroke and transient ischemic attack 
      depending on the descriptors and methods used to define it. CONCLUSION: There is 
      a significant difference between the genders in how fatigue is expressed.

PG  - 1661-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1440-1746.2010.06405.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: To investigate participation in a second round of colorectal 
      cancer screening using a fecal occult blood test (FOBT) in an Australian rural 
      community, and to assess the demographic characteristics and individual 
      perspectives associated with repeat screening. METHODS: Potential participants 
      from round 1 (50-74 years of age) were sent an intervention package and asked to 
      return a completed FOBT (n = 3406). Doctors of participants testing positive 
      referred to colonoscopy as appropriate. Following screening, 119 participants 
      completed qualitative telephone interviews. Multivariable logistic regression 
      models evaluated the association between round-2 participation and other 
      variables. RESULTS: Round-2 participation was 34.7%; the strongest predictor was 
      participation in round 1. Repeat participants were more likely to be female; 
      inconsistent screeners were more likely to be younger (aged 50-59 years). The 
      proportion of positive FOBT was 12.7%, that of colonoscopy compliance was 98.6%, 
      and the positive predictive value for cancer or adenoma of advanced pathology was 
      23.9%. Reasons for participation included testing as a precautionary measure or 
      having family history/friends with colorectal cancer; reasons for 
      non-participation included apathy or doctors' advice against screening. 
      CONCLUSION: Participation was relatively low and consistent across rounds. Unless 
      suitable strategies are identified to overcome behavioral trends and/or to screen 
      out ineligible participants, little change in overall participation rates can be 
      expected across rounds.

TI  - Predictors of psychosocial distress 12 months after diagnosis with early and 
      advanced prostate cancer.
PG  - S58-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess psychosocial distress in patients with early (localised) and 
      advanced (metastatic) prostate cancer (PCA) at diagnosis (Time 1) and 12 months 
      later (Time 2), and identify psychosocial factors predictive of later distress. 
      DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Observational, prospective study of 367 men 
      with early (211) or advanced (156) PCA recruited as consecutive attendees at 
      clinics at seven public hospitals and practices in metropolitan Melbourne between 
      1 April 2001 and 30 December 2005. Both groups completed questionnaires at Time 1 
      and Time 2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Health-related quality of life as assessed by 
      the Short Form 36-item Health Survey; psychological distress, including 
      depression and anxiety as assessed by the Brief Symptom Inventory; and coping 
      patterns as assessed by the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale. RESULTS: Over 
      the 12 months, both the early and advanced PCA group showed reduced vitality and 
      increased depression and anxiety; this effect was greater in the advanced PCA 
      group. Mental health, social functioning and role-emotional functioning also 
      deteriorated in the advanced group. Predictors of depression at Time 2 for the 
      early PCA group were depression, vitality and a fatalistic coping pattern at Time 
      1; anxiety at Time 2 was predicted by anxiety and vitality at Time 1. In the 
      advanced PCA group, depression at Time 2 was predicted by depression and mental 
      health at Time 1; anxiety at Time 2 was predicted by anxiety, mental health, 
      cognitive avoidance and lower anxious preoccupation at Time 1. CONCLUSIONS: Men 
      with early PCA experience decreasing vitality and increasing psychological 
      distress over the 12 months following diagnosis; this trend is accelerated after 
      diagnosis with advanced PCA. A fatalistic coping pattern at diagnosis of early 
      PCA predicts later depression while cognitive avoidance and lower anxious 
      preoccupation at diagnosis of advanced PCA predict later anxiety.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of venlafaxine extended release in patients with major 
      depressive disorder.
PG  - 413-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study we wanted to determine the efficacy and tolerability of 
      venlafaxine extended release in patients with major depressive disorder. SUBJECTS 
      AND METHODS: 161 patients with major depressive disorder were included in an 
      open-label, multicentre clinical study. All patients were treated with 
      venlafaxine extended release in flexible doses ranging from 75 to 325 mg daily 
      over an 8-week period. Efficacy measurements included the 17-item Hamilton 
      Depression Scale, the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I), the 
      Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S), and the Depression and Somatic Symptom Scale 
      (DSSS). All scales were administered at baseline and at weeks 2, 4 and 8. 
      RESULTS: A total of 148 (91.2%) patients completed the study. After 8 weeks of 
      treatment with venlafaxine extended release, response and remission rates were 
      93% and 45% respectively. At the end of the study, 52.7% of patients were rated 
      on CGI-S with 2 or 1 (not ill/mildly ill) and on CGI-I 81.1% of patients were 
      rated by the physician as much/very much improved. The severity of somatic 
      symptoms such as headache, back pain, chest pain, tenderness of more than a half 
      of body muscles, and fatigue or loss of energy decreased towards the end of the 
      study (p<.0001). Adverse events caused discontinuation in 4.7% of patients. No 
      significant changes of body mass (p=.237), Body Mass Index (p=.281), and heart 
      rate (p=.840) were present, but systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
      significantly decreased (p<.0001) towards the end of the study. CONCLUSION: The 
      data from this study indicate that venlafaxine XR is an efficient and safe 
      therapeutic option for patients with major depressive disorder, with the 
      additional effect of reducing associated painful physical symptoms.

TI  - The Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician rating scale (NPI-C): reliability and 
      validity of a revised assessment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia.
PG  - 984-94
LID - 10.1017/S1041610210000876 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) affect almost all patients with 
      dementia and are a major focus of study and treatment. Accurate assessment of NPS 
      through valid, sensitive and reliable measures is crucial. Although current NPS 
      measures have many strengths, they also have some limitations (e.g. acquisition 
      of data is limited to informants or caregivers as respondents, limited depth of 
      items specific to moderate dementia). Therefore, we developed a revised version 
      of the NPI, known as the NPI-C. The NPI-C includes expanded domains and items, 
      and a clinician-rating methodology. This study evaluated the reliability and 
      convergent validity of the NPI-C at ten international sites (seven languages). 
      METHODS: Face validity for 78 new items was obtained through a Delphi panel. A 
      total of 128 dyads (caregivers/patients) from three severity categories of 
      dementia (mild = 58, moderate = 49, severe = 21) were interviewed separately by 
      two trained raters using two rating methods: the original NPI interview and a 
      clinician-rated method. Rater 1 also administered four additional, established 
      measures: the Apathy Evaluation Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the 
      Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Index, and the Cornell Scale for Depression in 
      Dementia. Intraclass correlations were used to determine inter-rater reliability. 
      Pearson correlations between the four relevant NPI-C domains and their 
      corresponding outside measures were used for convergent validity. RESULTS: 
      Inter-rater reliability was strong for most items. Convergent validity was 
      moderate (apathy and agitation) to strong (hallucinations and delusions; 
      agitation and aberrant vocalization; and depression) for clinician ratings in 
      NPI-C domains. CONCLUSION: Overall, the NPI-C shows promise as a versatile tool 
      which can accurately measure NPS and which uses a uniform scale system to 
      facilitate data comparisons across studies.

TI  - Factor structure of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale in unipolar depression.
PG  - 329-34
LID - 10.1016/j.jad.2009.11.019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In clinical practice patients with unipolar depression present with a 
      variety of symptom clusters that may combine together in many different ways. 
      However, only few factor analytic studies used general psychopathology scales to 
      investigate the symptom structure of unipolar depression. METHODS: The study 
      included 163 consecutive inpatients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of depressive 
      disorder (ICD-10 codes F32 to F33). All patients were assessed with the 18-item 
      version of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) within 3days from admission. 
      Exploratory factor analysis with Varimax rotation was performed on BPRS items. 
      RESULTS: Four factors were extracted, explaining 52% of total variance. They were 
      interpreted as Apathy, Dysphoria, Depression and Psychoticism. The distribution 
      of factor scores was approximately normal for Apathy, while it displayed a slight 
      negative skewness for Depression, a slight positive skewness for Dysphoria, and a 
      marked positive skewness for Psychoticism. Patient sex, family history of 
      depression, lifetime history of suicide attempt, and recent serious family 
      conflict were not associated with any factor. Occupational status, age, and age 
      at onset displayed a positive correlation with Apathy. Duration of illness and 
      number of previous admissions were positively correlated with Dysphoria. 
      LIMITATIONS: Patients were not administered a structured diagnostic interview, 
      and no detailed assessment of personality disorders was performed; also, patients 
      were recruited only at a single site, which reduces the generalizability of the 
      results. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that in depressive disorders there are 
      psychopathological dimensions other than depressed mood that are worthy of 
      greater clinical attention and research. Dimensions such as apathy and dysphoria 
      may play an important part in the clinical phenomenology of unipolar depression 
      and deserve systematic and careful assessment in order to provide patients with 
      the best possible treatment and improve clinical outcomes.

TI  - 'Why I feel bad': refinement of the Effects of Prostate Cancer Upon Lifestyle 
      Questionnaire and an initial exploration of its links with anxiety and depression 
      among prostate cancer patients.
PG  - 839-46

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To psychometrically refine a standardized scale for identifying those 
      lifestyle changes that were most likely to contribute to anxiety and depression 
      among prostate cancer (PCa) patients. METHODS: Three hundred and eighty-one PCa 
      patients who had received their initial diagnosis between one and 96 months 
      completed a survey of background variables, anxiety and depression inventories 
      and the 36-item Effects of Prostate Cancer upon Lifestyle Questionnaire (EPCLQ). 
      RESULTS: Levels of anxiety (24%) and depression (26%) were similar to those 
      previously reported for PCa patients. The EPCLQ was shown to have satisfactory 
      psychometric properties and significantly predicted anxiety and depression scores 
      and the presence of psychological clinicity among this sample. Factor analysis of 
      the EPCLQ showed that adverse emotions and social withdrawal, plus loss of 
      cognitive ability, were the most powerful predictors of fear, physiological 
      arousal, discomfort and pain factors underlying anxiety; these factors also 
      predicted pessimism and fatigue factors underlying depression. conclusions: The 
      EPCLQ was shown to be a reliably sound and valid instrument for assessing 
      important lifestyle changes that predict anxiety and depression among PCa 
      patients. In addition, links between receiving a diagnosis and treatment for PCa 
      and development of psychosocial disturbance via emotional negativity, decreased 
      cognitive performance and withdrawal from others appear to warrant further 
      investigation.

PG  - 284-91
LID - 10.1097/JCN.0b013e3181cfbcbb [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical symptoms are likely to occur in clusters that may be 
      associated with adverse outcome in patients with heart failure (HF). Despite the 
      importance of early recognition of worsening symptoms in HF management, the 
      impact of physical symptoms on adverse outcome has not been explored in the 
      context of symptom clusters. PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to explore 
      which physical symptom clusters occur in HF patients and to determine the impact 
      of symptom clusters on event-free survival. METHODS: A total of 421 patients (60% 
      male; 62 [SD, 14] years; 72% New York Heart Association class II/III) completed 
      the modified Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Heart Failure to measure physical 
      symptoms during an index hospitalization in Seoul, Korea. Times to first event of 
      cardiac rehospitalization and cardiac death were collected for 12 months after 
      discharge and confirmed by review of hospital records. An agglomerative 
      hierarchical clustering approach with Ward's method was used to identify symptom 
      clusters. Hierarchical Cox hazard regression was used to determine the impact of 
      symptom clusters on cardiac rehospitalization and cardiac mortality. RESULTS: Two 
      distinct symptom clusters, the dyspneic and the weary symptom clusters, occurred 
      in patients with HF. Shortness of breath, difficulty breathing when lying flat, 
      and waking up breathless at night comprised the dyspneic symptom cluster. Lack of 
      energy, lack of appetite, and difficulty sleeping comprised the weary symptom 
      cluster. In hierarchical Cox hazard regression, elevated distress from the weary 
      symptom cluster independently predicted cardiac rehospitalization (hazard ratio, 
      1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.93), and increased distress from the 
      dyspneic symptom cluster independently predicted cardiac mortality (hazard ratio, 
      2.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-3.34). CONCLUSION: The weary and the dyspneic 
      symptom clusters predicted cardiac rehospitalization and cardiac mortality, 
      respectively. Patient education for self-monitoring of symptoms should focus on 
      symptom clusters rather than single symptom.

      subjective symptoms, which have not extensively been studied in hypogonadal men 
      with the MetS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-IA), 
      Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) scale, and International Index of Erectile Function 
      5-item (IIEF-5) scale at baseline, 18 and 30 weeks were analysed using multilevel 
      analysis. METHODS: In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase III 
      trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00696748), 184 men suffering from both 
      the MetS and hypogonadism were included. They were treated for 30 weeks with 
      either parenteral testosterone undecanoate (TU; 1,000 mg IM TU, at baseline, and 
      after 6 and 18 weeks; Nebido or placebo injections, 105 (92.9%) men receiving TU 
      and 65 (91.5%) receiving placebo completed the 30-week trial. RESULTS: The 184 
      men were aged mean 52.1 years old (standard deviation [SD] 9.6; range 35-69), 
      with a mean body mass index of 35.5 kg/m(2) (SD 6.7; range 25.1-54.8), and a mean 
      total testosterone level of 8.0 nmol/L (SD 4.0). There were significant 
      improvements in BDI-IA (mean difference vs. placebo after 30 weeks: -2.5 points; 
      95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.9; -4.1; P = 0.003), AMS (-7.4 points; 95% CI: 
      -4.3; -10.5; P < 0.001), and IIEF-5 (+3.1 points; 95% CI: +1.8; +4.4; P < 0.001). 
      The effects on the BDI-IA, AMS, and IIEF-5 were strongest in men with baseline 
      total testosterone levels <7.7 mmol/L (i.e., median value). CONCLUSIONS: TU 
      administration may improve depressive symptoms, aging male symptoms and sexual 
      dysfunction in hypogonadal men with the MetS. The beneficial effects of 
      testosterone were most evident in men with the lowest baseline total testosterone 
      levels.

TI  - The Fatigue Questionnaire: Standardization in patients with major depression.
PG  - 114-9
LID - 10.1016/j.psychres.2009.01.029 [doi]
AB  - Fatigue measures have not been specifically standardized in depressed patients. 
      This study aimed to investigate the reliability and validity of the 14-item 
      Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ), a widely used multidimensional fatigue measure, in 
      patients with major depression without comorbid fatigue-associated conditions. 
      Subjects included were 81 patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Hamilton 
      Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores > or = 15 without conditions associated 
      with prominent fatigue and 40 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. The vitality 
      subscale of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36vit) and a visual analogue 
      fatigue scale (VASF) served as standards of reference for reported fatigue. The 
      FQ presented satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient 
      0.924), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.978), 
      discriminant validity (between patients and controls) and concurrent validity 
      (correlations with the SF-36vit and the VASF were -0.469 and 0.477, 
      respectively). Factor analysis showed a two-factor structure (physical and mental 
      fatigue), i.e. a structure similar to the one originally proposed. However, items 
      3 ('sleepiness'), 4 ('difficulty starting things') and 14 ('loss of interest') 
      did not load on the factor expected. With these items removed, the derived 
      11-item version of the scale was shown to be a 'purer' measure of fatigue in 
      depressed patients, independent of the severity of depression and comorbid 
      sleepiness.

TI  - PDD-Short Screen: a brief cognitive test for screening dementia in Parkinson's 
      disease.
PG  - 440-6
LID - 10.1002/mds.22877 [doi]
AB  - The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) is currently based on 
      clinical criteria (DSM-IV, MDS-Task Force). In daily practice and research 
      studies, these criteria still depend on the subjective impression of the 
      examiner. Brief screening tests (BST) are helpful in identifying patients with PD 
      with dementia, which can be difficult in patients with advanced PD. We aimed to 
      develop a BST for PD, the PDD-Short Screen (PDD-SS), to accurately and quickly 
      screen for PDD. In this prospective study, 70 patients with nondemented (age 73.8 
      +/- 4.4) and 32 demented (age 73.8 +/- 4.4) PD regularly attending a Movement 
      Disorders Clinic were included. Diagnosis of dementia was based on DSM-IV 
      criteria, CDR score >or=1, and PD-CRS total score <or=64. The PDD-SS, Mattis 
      Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were 
      administered to all participants. Validity, reliability, and discriminative power 
      of the PDD-SS were examined. The final version of the scale included the items 
      immediate and delayed verbal memory, clock drawing, alternating verbal fluency, 
      and a questionnaire covering cognitive and psychiatric (hallucinations, apathy) 
      symptoms common in PDD. A cutoff score <or=11 on the PDD-SS yielded high 
      sensitivity (89.8%) and specificity (88.5%) for diagnosing PDD. The MDRS 
      displayed similar accuracy, but the PDD-SS administration time was significantly 
      shorter (4.8-6.9 vs. 17.5-25.2 minutes). Diagnosis of dementia using the PDD-SS 
      was not influenced by age, education, or motor function. The PDD-SS appears as 
      the first BST for diagnosing PDD, displays an excellent diagnostic accuracy, and 
      takes 5 to 7 minutes to be administered.

TI  - Misreporting of energy intake in the elderly using doubly labeled water to 
      measure total energy expenditure and weight change.
PG  - 14-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the major problems in dietary assessment is inaccuracy in 
      reporting diet. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between self-reported 
      energy intake (EI) by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and energy expenditure 
      (EE), measured by doubly labeled water (DLW), among older persons. DESIGN: EE was 
      assessed in 298 high-functioning, community-dwelling older adults (70-79 years of 
      age) over a 2-week period using DLW. Dietary intake was assessed using a Block 
      FFQ. The ratio between reported EI and total energy expenditure (TEE) was 
      calculated. Misreporting was defined as follows: participants with an EI/TEE 
      ratio of <0.77 were categorized as low energy reporters, while participants with 
      an EI/TEE ratio >1.28 were categorized as high energy reporters. Participants 
      with an EI/TEE ratio of 0.77-1.28 were categorized as "true" energy reporters. 
      One-year percent weight change prior to EE visit was used as another validation 
      indicator. Participants who were low energy reporters but lost >2% of their body 
      weight were categorized as undereaters. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-six 
      participants provided both FFQ and DLW measurements. Forty-three percent of 
      participants were low energy reporters; among them, almost 30% lost weight and, 
      therefore, were categorized as undereaters. The undereaters consumed 
      significantly fewer calories. No difference in the frequency of low energy 
      reporting was detected between genders or racial groups. Underreporters had 
      significantly higher body weight than "true" or high reporters. Undereaters 
      tended to have higher body mass index than the underreporters. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Undereating is prevalent in the elderly and may be falsely perceived as 
      underreporting. It should be further addressed and characterized in future 
      studies.

TI  - The cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome: myth or reality?
PG  - 265-72
LID - 10.1007/s00520-009-0772-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversy exists as what constitutes the cancer anorexia-cachexia 
      syndrome (CACS), and whether it truly is a distinct clinical disorder. In this 
      study, we aimed to: (1) assess if CACS is a distinct clinical disorder, (2) 
      identify the symptoms characteristic of CACS, (3) evaluate CACS impact on patient 
      outcomes (symptom burden and survival time from referral). METHODS: Consecutive 
      patients referred to palliative medicine were assessed by 38-symptom 
      questionnaire. Demographics, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), disease 
      and extent, and survival were recorded. CACS, defined as anorexia plus weight 
      loss (>10% of pre-illness weight). For analysis, patients were divided into four 
      groups: (1) group CACS; (2) group A (only anorexia, NO >10% pre-illness weight 
      loss); (3) group WL (weight loss >10% pre-illness weight only but NO anorexia); 
      and (4) group N (NO weight loss >10% pre-illness weight and NO anorexia). 
      Symptoms present in > or =5%, and patients with complete data were analyzed. 
      RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-four patients had complete data, metastatic cancer, 
      and 26 symptoms present in > or =5%. Groups had significantly different ECOG, 
      symptom burden, and survival. Significantly different symptom prevalence between 
      groups: dry mouth,*early satiety,*constipation,*nausea,*taste 
      changes,*vomiting,*dysphagia,*fatigue,*weak,*lack of energy, insomnia, dyspnea, 
      depression, hoarseness, and anxiety. The nine symptoms with asterisk were CACS 
      specific. Symptom Burden: CACS independently predicted greatest burden. Survival: 
      Group N had significantly longer survival. CONCLUSIONS: CACS appeared to be a 
      distinct disorder with unique clinical characteristics in our advanced cancer 
      population. Nine other symptoms constituted CACS. CACS independently predicted 
      higher symptom burden. CACS absence predicted longer survival. More evidence is 
      needed to better characterize this syndrome and generate a valid CACS consensus. 
      A comprehensive validated CACS assessment instrument is required.

TI  - [Apathy: from symptom to syndrome].
PG  - 397-405
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a major behavioural problem in dementia and other 
      neuropsychiatric diseases. AIM: To provide an overview of the development of the 
      concept of apathy and its importance for clinical practice. METHOD: The article 
      is based on a review of the literature. RESULTS: There is evidence that apathy 
      should be regarded as a syndrome rather than a symptom. Apathy is a construct 
      that has several aspects and can occur across a range of diseases.It can occur as 
      part of depressive disorders or cognitive deterioration or it can occur 
      independently. Recently, diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of the apathy 
      syndrome have been formulated on the basis of an international consensus. 
      CONCLUSION: The diagnostic criteria that have been formulated recently will make 
      it much easier to validate measuring instruments and research into the 
      epidemiology, aetiology, pathophysiology and treatment of apathy.

TI  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms in korean patients with Alzheimer's disease: 
      exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis of the 
      neuropsychiatric inventory.
PG  - 82-7
LID - 10.1159/000264629 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: We designed this study to examine subsyndromes in Korean 
      patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) 
      and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). METHODS: Initial participants were 778 AD 
      patients recruited from the Clinical Research Center for Dementia of South Korea 
      and assessed via the Korean Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Those with > or =1 
      neuropsychiatric symptom were randomly divided into groups. Principal axis 
      factoring with oblimin rotation was used to analyze group 1 inventory results, 
      and maximum likelihood estimation extraction with Bollen-Stine bootstrapping was 
      used for group 2. RESULTS: The results of the EFA showed the presence of 4 
      subsyndromes: hyperactivity, affect, psychosis and apathy/vegetative symptom. The 
      CFA results indicated this model was the best-fitting model for explaining these 
      subsyndromes. CONCLUSION: Our model showed the best fit and identified 4 
      subsyndromes. This study might contribute to a clearer understanding of the 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD.

PG  - 80-5
LID - 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2009.10.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to identify clinical factors in 
      the acute stage that can predict anxiety, depression and apathy at 4 months after 
      stroke. METHODS: One hundred four consecutive stroke patients in a stroke unit 
      were assessed within the first 2 weeks and after 4 months. Assessments included 
      anxiety and depression symptoms on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
      (HADS) [HADS Anxiety subscale (HADS-A) > or = 8 and HADS Depression subscale 
      (HADS-D) > or = 8], physical impairment, functional disability, somatic 
      comorbidity upon admission, assessment of apathy (score > or = 34 on the Apathy 
      Evaluation Scale) and a psychiatric Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
      Disorders, Fourth Edition diagnosis of anxiety disorder (anxiety) or depression 
      (depression) on follow-up. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify 
      factors associated with anxiety, depression and apathy. RESULTS: Anxiety and 
      depression at 4 months were significantly associated with HADS-A scores of > or = 
      8 upon admission [odds ratio (OR)=4.4; 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.7-11.9; 
      P=.003 and OR=2.9; 95% CI=1.0-7.9; P=.043, respectively]. Apathy at 4 months was 
      significantly associated with somatic comorbidity upon admission (OR=3.0; 95% 
      CI=1.0-8.3; P=.036) and had a borderline association with HADS-D scores of > or = 
      8 (OR=8.4; 95% CI=1.0-72.0; P=.051) upon admission. CONCLUSION: Assessment with 
      HADS within the first 2 weeks of stroke can contribute to the detection of 
      patients at risk for clinically significant anxiety, depression and apathy at 4 
      months after stroke.

      vascular disease.
PG  - 298-302
LID - 10.1159/000272003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular damage of frontal-subcortical circuits involved in mood 
      regulation and cognition might be the main contributor to the pathogenesis of 
      late-life depression, and it is linked to poor response to treatment. OBJECTIVE: 
      To investigate the relationship between executive dysfunction and outcome of 
      depressive symptoms among elderly patients with subcortical ischemic vascular 
      disease. METHODS: Ninety-two elderly patients with white matter lesions (WMLs) or 
      lacunar infarcts (LAs) on brain MRI and depressive symptomatology were 
      consecutively recruited. Depression was rated with the Hamilton Depression Rating 
      Scale (HDRS). Evaluation of executive functions by means of the Stroop color-word 
      test was performed at entry of the study, and WMLs were categorized into mild, 
      moderate or severe. Mood was reevaluated by means of HDRS after the 12th week of 
      pharmacological treatment. RESULTS: Psychomotor retardation, difficulties at 
      work, apathy, and lack of insight were the predominant symptoms. Fifty-six 
      patients (62.8%) had a neuroradiological picture of WMLs, while the remaining 33 
      (37.1%) had LAs. Executive dysfunctions significantly and independently predict 
      poor outcome of depressive symptoms. Patients with the severest WMLs showed not 
      only a greater executive dysfunction, but also a minor response to antidepressant 
      treatment. CONCLUSION: This study supports the vascular depression hypothesis. 
      WMLs are of crucial clinical relevance as they are linked with cognitive symptoms 
      and poor antidepressant outcome.

TI  - Apathy in first episode psychosis patients: one year follow up.
PG  - 20-6
LID - 10.1016/j.schres.2009.10.014 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study describes how the negative subsyndrome of apathy 
      develops over the first year in first episode psychosis (FEP) patients, with an 
      emphasis on the prevalence of enduring apathy and the relationship between 
      apathy, other symptoms and functioning. METHODS: Eighty four FEP patients were 
      assessed both at baseline and after one year with the abridged clinical version 
      of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-C-Apathy). Other symptoms were assessed with 
      the Positive and Negative syndrome scale (PANSS) and functioning with the split 
      version of the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF-F). RESULTS: The mean 
      level of AES-C-Apathy decreased from baseline to the one year follow up for the 
      whole group of FEP patients. High levels of apathy at 1year were best predicted 
      by high levels of apathy at baseline, a long DUP and a diagnosis within the 
      Schizophrenia spectrum. The presence of depression and level of medication only 
      had a minor influence. AES-C-Apathy had a stronger association to GAF-F than 
      other PANSS symptom areas. Twenty five (30%) FEP patients had high enduring 
      levels of apathy. This group consisted of significantly more males, had a longer 
      duration of untreated psychosis, a greater likelihood of a Schizophrenia spectrum 
      diagnosis, fewer were in remission of positive symptoms and they had 
      significantly poorer functioning at both baseline and follow up. CONCLUSION: This 
      study confirms that the negative subsyndrome of apathy is significantly related 
      to poor functioning in FEP. Including negative symptoms and its subsyndromes in 
      early detection strategies are warranted.

LID - 10.3109/09638280902971398 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To apply Rasch analysis to the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) 
      responses of a mixed neurorehabilitation sample to determine its suitability for 
      assessing depression among this group. METHOD: Three hundred and fifteen 
      in-patients undergoing post-acute specialist in-patient rehabilitation at the 
      Regional Rehabilitation Unit (RRU) of Northwick Park Hospital in North London 
      were administered the Beck Depression Inventory. All patients were administered 
      the BDI-II by a clinical psychologist using a large print version and taking as 
      much time as patients required. Rasch analysis was completed using the RUMM2020 
      software. Where disordered thresholds were identified item rescoring was 
      undertaken. Each item was also examined for Differential Item Functioning. Where 
      misfit to model expectations was identified items were removed in an iterative 
      fashion. The effect of any deletion upon person estimates was examined. Specific 
      tests of unidimensionality were undertaken at each iterative phase. RESULTS: 
      Rescoring was necessary before Items 1-4, 6, 8-12, 20 and 21 showed ordered 
      thresholds. Three items failed to satisfy model expectations - items 16 (changes 
      in sleeping pattern), 18 (changes in appetite) and 21 (loss of interest in sex) 
      and were deleted - after which good overall fit to the Rasch model was observed. 
      The three items deleted affected person estimates in a significant way such that 
      the 21 item version in this group of patients may be biased because of 
      multidimensionality. CONCLUSIONS: The BDI-II in a sample of patients undergoing 
      neurorehabilitation satisfies unidimensional Rasch model expectations in an 
      18-item format. Some disordering of response categories was evident, but this 
      evidence requires replication before any common rescoring option should be 
      considered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment secondary to frontal lobe atrophy exists in 
      40-60% of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) cases. We aimed to determine the 
      prevalence of frontal-lobe mediated behavioral impairment in (ALS) and to 
      ascertain its relationship to cognitive impairment. METHODS: Two-hundred and 
      twenty five patients diagnosed with sporadic ALS were evaluated for behavioral 
      dysfunction using the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe), a validated measure 
      used to examine frontal-lobe mediated behaviors, specifically apathy, executive 
      dysfunction and disinhibition; a total behavior score is also provided. 
      Additionally, a subset of patients also underwent a comprehensive 
      neuropsychological evaluation. RESULTS: Changes in the total FrSBe scores were 
      observed in 24.4% of the patients and 39.6% of the patients had impairment in at 
      least one behavioral domain with symptoms of Apathy being the most common 
      (31.1%). Cognitively impaired ALS patients had worse total (P = 0.05) and apathy 
      scores (P < 0.01); however, behavioral dysfunction was also present in 16% of the 
      cognitively intact patients. Half of the behaviorally intact patients exhibited 
      cognitive impairment. Significant correlations were observed for performance on 
      certain neuropsychological tests (Animal fluency, Block Design, Logical Memory I 
      and Verbal Series Attention Test) and severity of behavioral dysfunction on 
      certain FrSBe sub scores. CONCLUSIONS: Frontal-lobe mediated behavioral 
      dysfunction appears to be common in ALS. Cognitively impaired ALS patients had 
      greater behavioral dysfunction. Recognition of behavioral and cognitive 
      dysfunction may assist health-care providers and care-givers recognize changes in 
      decision-making capacity and treatment compliance of patients with ALS.

TI  - Environmental correlates of neuropsychiatric symptoms in nursing home patients 
      with dementia.
PG  - 14-22
LID - 10.1002/gps.2292 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the influence of environmental 
      correlates of neuropsychiatric symptoms in nursing home patients with dementia. 
      METHODS: 1289 patients in 56 Dementia Special Care Units (SCUs) in the 
      Netherlands were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home 
      version (NPI-NH) and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Potential 
      correlates of the neuropsychiatric symptoms studied were gender and age of the 
      patient, dementia severity, psychoactive medication use and environmental 
      correlates such as the number of patients per unit or per living room, staff 
      size/patient ratio, time spent on care activities and presence of a walking 
      circuit. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the 
      relative contribution of the different factors in explaining neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms variability. RESULTS: The prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms 
      differed between SCUs, also after correcting for patient factors. Patient-related 
      factors explained 7-21% of the total variance of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Intra 
      Class Correlation (the correlation of symptoms of patients within SCUs) ranged 
      from 0.039 (psychosis) to 0.163 (apathy). The variance in SCU symptom prevalence 
      (variance between SCUs) accounted for 3.5-14.8% of the total variance in 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms. In SCUs of which the staff spent more time on care 
      activities did the patients show lower levels of apathy. Other environmental 
      correlates did not predict neuropsychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSION: The substantial 
      variation of prevalence rates between SCUs in combination with the clustering of 
      symptoms within SCUs is strong evidence for the environmental contribution to 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms and the multifactorial nature of behaviour in dementia.

TI  - Quality of life after successful treatment of early-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma: 
      10-year follow-up of the EORTC-GELA H8 randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 1160-70
LID - 10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70258-X [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the longitudinal course of health-related 
      quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma during their 
      post-treatment follow-up and re-adaptation to normal life. We report on the HRQoL 
      of patients treated in the randomised H8 trial of the European Organisation for 
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Lymphoma Group and the Groupe d'Etudes 
      des Lymphomes de l'Adulte (GELA). We aimed to assess HRQoL and fatigue following 
      treatment, to analyse relations with treatment, and to identify factors that 
      predict persistent fatigue. METHODS: Patients received HRQoL questionnaires at 
      the end of primary therapy and during follow-up. The EORTC QLQ-C30 was used to 
      assess HRQoL, and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) was used to 
      assess fatigue. Changes of mean HRQoL scores over time were analysed with mixed 
      models. Multiple polytomic nominal logistic regression was done to identify 
      independent baseline predictors of fatigue within MFI-20 dimensions. Analyses 
      were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This study is registered with 
      www.ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00379041. FINDINGS: 2666 assessments from 935 
      patients were analysed. Mean follow-up was 90 months (range 52-118). Age affected 
      all functioning and symptom scores except emotional functioning, with younger age 
      associated with higher functioning and lower severity of symptoms; improvement 
      with time showed similar patterns between age groups. Women reported lower HRQoL 
      and higher symptom scores than did men. Overall, 3.2% (14/439 for role 
      functioning) to 9.7% (43/442 for social functioning) and 5.8% (29/498 for reduced 
      motivation) to 9.9% (49/498 for general fatigue) of patients reported impairments 
      of 10 points or more (on a 0-100 scale) in QLQ-C30 and MFI-20 scores, 
      respectively, independent of age and sex. Emotional domains were more affected 
      than physical ones. There was no relation between HRQoL outcome and type of 
      treatment. Fatigue (MFI-20 scores) at the end of treatment was the only 
      predictive variable for persistent fatigue, with odds ratios varying from 2.58 
      (95% CI 1.00-6.67) to 41.51 (12.02-143.33; p</=0.0001). Sensitivity analyses 
      adjusting for missing data were much the same as the main results. 
      INTERPRETATION: HRQoL data after treatment for early-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma 
      show that patients experience strain and limitations in all subdomains apart from 
      cognitive functioning (QLQ-C30), and also have reduced motivation (MFI-20). 
      Differences in HRQoL improvement with time were linked to age and sex, but not 
      type of treatment. Fatigue status at the end of treatment seems to predict 
      subsequent HRQoL. FUNDING: French Ministry of Health, Programme Hospitalier de

TI  - Energy intake and expenditure profile in chronic peritoneal dialysis patients 
      complicated with circulatory congestion.
PG  - 1179-84
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.2009.28160 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Circulatory congestion is an adverse predictor of mortality in 
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the 
      nutritional status, energy intake, and expenditure profile of PD patients with 
      and without previous circulatory congestion. DESIGN: We conducted a 
      cross-sectional study in 244 PD patients, of whom 92 had previous circulatory 
      congestion. We estimated dietary energy intake by using a locally validated 7-d 
      food-frequency questionnaire and by assessing resting energy expenditure (REE) 
      and total energy expenditure (TEE) with indirect calorimetry and a locally 
      validated physical activity questionnaire, respectively. RESULTS: In comparison 
      with those without circulatory congestion, patients with previous circulatory 
      congestion were more malnourished by subjective global assessment (59% compared 
      with 36%; P < 0.001), had lower handgrip strength, had lower midarm muscle 
      circumference, had lower dietary protein (0.98 +/- 0.45 compared with 1.19 +/- 
      0.44 g x kg(-1) x d(-1); P < 0.001), and had lower energy intake (92.5 +/- 37.0 
      compared with 110.9 +/- 35.7 kJ x kg(-1) x d(-1); P < 0.001) but had higher 
      C-reactive protein (P = 0.025) and higher REE (P < 0.001). However, no difference 
      in TEE was noted between the 2 groups, which indicated lower activity energy 
      expenditure among patients with previous circulatory congestion. The resulting 
      energy balance was significantly more negative for patients with previous 
      circulatory congestion than for those without previous circulatory congestion (P 
      = 0.050). Furthermore, the prevalence of malnutrition increased with increasing 
      episodes of circulatory congestion (P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with 
      previous circulatory congestion had significantly more inflammation, more muscle 
      wasting, and higher REE but lower activity energy expenditure and energy and 
      protein intakes in keeping with an anorexia-cachexia syndrome. The mechanisms of 
      increased REE and reduced energy intake among patients with previous circulatory 
      congestion warrant further investigation.

LID - 10.1002/cncr.24520 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess which quality-of-life (QOL) 
      line items on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian (FACT-O) were 
      associated with low QOL in women who were receiving chemotherapy for ovarian 
      cancer. METHODS: Patients with stage III or IV ovarian cancer on Gynecologic 
      Oncology Group Protocols 152 and 172 who underwent primary surgery followed by 
      intravenous paclitaxel and cisplatin completed the FACT-O. The FACT scale 
      includes the 4 domains of physical, functional, social, and emotional well being 
      (PWB, FWB, SWB, EWB, respectively). Women who had overall FACT-O scores in the 
      lowest quartile (Q1) were compared with women in the upper 3 quartiles (Q2-Q4). 
      The proportions of women in each group that selected the 2 worst categories for 
      each item were compared. The level of significance was set at P<.005. RESULTS: 
      Before Cycle 4, 361 patients (86.4%) provided valid QOL assessments. For PWB, a 
      significantly greater proportion of women in Q1 versus Q2 through Q4 selected the 
      2 worst categories of several physical symptoms (nausea, pain, feeling ill, and 
      being bothered by the side effects of treatment). For FWB, significant 
      differences included being able to work, being content with the quality of their 
      life, and sleeping well. For EWB, there were significant differences in feeling 
      nervous and worrying about dying. There were virtually no differences between 
      groups in SWB. Low interest in sex was reported by 56% to 88% of all patients 
      (Q1-Q4). CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of women with FACT-O scores in the 
      lowest quartile reported problems that potentially were amenable to clinical 
      interventions, such as symptom management and psychosocial support.

TI  - Coping styles in heart failure patients with depressive symptoms.
PG  - 339-46
LID - 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2009.05.014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Elevated depressive symptoms have been linked to poorer prognosis in 
      heart failure (HF) patients. Our objective was to identify coping styles 
      associated with depressive symptoms in HF patients. METHODS: A total of 222 
      stable HF patients (32.75% female, 45.4% non-Hispanic black) completed multiple 
      questionnaires. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) assessed depressive symptoms, 
      Life Orientation Test (LOT-R) assessed optimism, ENRICHD Social Support Inventory 
      (ESSI) and Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) assessed social support, and 
      COPE assessed coping styles. Linear regression analyses were employed to assess 
      the association of coping styles with continuous BDI scores. Logistic regression 
      analyses were performed using BDI scores dichotomized into BDI<10 vs. BDI> or 
      =10, to identify coping styles accompanying clinically significant depressive 
      symptoms. RESULTS: In linear regression models, higher BDI scores were associated 
      with lower scores on the acceptance (beta=-.14), humor (beta=-.15), planning 
      (beta=-.15), and emotional support (beta=-.14) subscales of the COPE, and higher 
      scores on the behavioral disengagement (beta=.41), denial (beta=.33), venting 
      (beta=.25), and mental disengagement (beta=.22) subscales. Higher PSSS and ESSI 
      scores were associated with lower BDI scores (beta=-.32 and -.25, respectively). 
      Higher LOT-R scores were associated with higher BDI scores (beta=.39, P<.001). In 
      logistical regression models, BDI> or =10 was associated with greater likelihood 
      of behavioral disengagement (OR=1.3), denial (OR=1.2), mental disengagement 
      (OR=1.3), venting (OR=1.2), and pessimism (OR=1.2), and lower perceived social 
      support measured by PSSS (OR=.92) and ESSI (OR=.92). CONCLUSION: Depressive 
      symptoms in HF patients are associated with avoidant coping, lower perceived 
      social support, and pessimism. Results raise the possibility that interventions 
      designed to improve coping may reduce depressive symptoms.

TI  - Helplessness predicts the development of hypertension in older Mexican and 
      European Americans.
PG  - 333-7
LID - 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2009.04.007 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The mechanisms by which depression is associated with an elevated risk 
      of cardiovascular disease remain unclear. It is possible that depressive symptoms 
      could increase the risk of hypertension, which in turn could predispose to 
      cardiovascular disease. The goal of this study was to explore whether individual 
      depressive symptoms might predict the incidence of hypertension in a cohort of 
      240 initially normotensive Mexican-American and European-American elders. 
      METHODS: Subjects were 65-78 years old on entering the San Antonio Longitudinal 
      Study of Aging, an epidemiologic survey, at which time they completed the 30-item 
      Geriatric Depression Scale in English or Spanish. Their blood pressure was 
      reassessed a mean of 7.0 years later. Responses to six key scale items (depressed 
      mood, decreased interest, worthlessness, hopelessness, helplessness, and fatigue) 
      were evaluated for the ability to predict incident hypertension. RESULTS: In 
      univariate analyses, only helplessness significantly predicted incident 
      hypertension (chi-square 13.5, df=1, P=.0003). In a Cox proportional hazards 
      model adjusted for sex, education, number of comorbid diseases, current drinking, 
      social well-being, and marital status, helplessness remained a very strong 
      predictor [hazard ratio (HR) 4.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.90-13.12, 
      P=.0011]. Total depression score also predicted incident hypertension, but less 
      strongly (HR 1.08, CI 1.00-1.17, P=.0339). CONCLUSION: Helplessness may predict 
      the development of hypertension in the elderly. Further research into this 
      relationship might lead to interventions to reduce the risk of cardiovascular 
      disease.

TI  - The symptomatology of post-stroke depression: comparison of stroke and myocardial 
      infarction patients.
PG  - 1134-42
LID - 10.1002/gps.2236 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a frequent problem in stroke patients but, all too 
      often, the problem goes unrecognized. How depression-like symptoms in post-stroke 
      depression (PSD) should be interpreted is still subject to debate. If PSD has a 
      distinct symptom profile of depression accompanying other chronic vascular 
      somatic conditions then this could imply that PSD is a specific disease entity. 
      OBJECTIVE: To study whether depressed stroke patients exhibit other signs and 
      symptoms than patients suffering from depression after myocardial infarction 
      (MI). METHODS: Depressive signs and symptoms were measured using the Hospital 
      Anxiety and Depression Scale and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. 
      The results of 190 stroke patients were compared with the results of 198 MI 
      patients every 3 months during the first year after the event. RESULTS: Depressed 
      stroke patients exhibited more loss of interest, psychomotor retardation, and 
      gastro-intestinal complaints as compared to depressed MI patients. However, in 
      multivariate analyses including both depressed and non-depressed stroke and MI 
      patients, no specific symptom profile was found to differentiate between the two 
      depressive syndromes by looking at the modifying effect of stroke vs MI on the 
      occurrence of specific symptoms in depression. CONCLUSION: Although in their 
      clinical presentation, depressed stroke patients exhibit a symptom profile 
      different from depressed MI patients, this is not due to differences in the 
      depressive syndrome in these two patient groups but it reflects differences 
      between stroke and MI patients in general.

PG  - 759-64
LID - 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605235 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited research has investigated the specific needs of patients with 
      advanced incurable cancer. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence 
      of perceived needs among this population. METHODS: Medical specialists from two 
      regions in New South Wales, Australia, identified patients with advanced, 
      incurable cancer, who were estimated to have a life expectancy of <2 years and 
      were not receiving formal palliative care. Of the 418 eligible patients, 246 
      (59%) consented to participate. Consenting patients completed the Needs 
      Assessment for Advanced Cancer Patients questionnaire, which has demonstrable 
      validity and reliability. Patients' perceived needs were assessed across the 
      seven domains of the questionnaire: psychological, daily living, medical 
      communication and information, symptom related, social, spiritual and financial 
      needs. RESULTS: Patients identified the greatest areas of need in relation to 
      psychological and medical communication/information domains. Patients' specific 
      needs were highest in dealing with a lack of energy and tiredness, coping with 
      fears about the cancer spreading, and coping with frustration at not being able 
      to do the things they used to do. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that patients 
      with advanced, incurable cancer have high levels of unmet needs, especially in 
      relation to the areas of psychological and medical communication/information 
      needs. The data have the potential to guide the development of interventions 
      aimed at meeting the current unmet needs of patients with advanced, incurable 
      cancer.

TI  - Anhedonia and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease: Italian validation of 
      the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale and its application in the clinical routine 
      practice during the PRIAMO study.
PG  - 576-81
LID - 10.1016/j.parkreldis.2009.02.004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the 
      Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) and to study the relationship between 
      anhedonia, depression and cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's 
      disease (PD). METHODS: The SHAPS (14 items) was translated into Italian and 
      pre-tested in a pilot study. Two items evaluating physical anhedonia related to 
      sexual issues were added. The Italian version of SHAPS was validated in 274 
      consecutive PD patients, divided into patients with major depression according to 
      DSM-IV criteria (dPD) and patients without depression (nPD), and in healthy 
      subjects. To test the feasibility of the instrument and to determine whether 
      clinical data affect anhedonia, we also administered SHAPS to 1307 patients with 
      different types of parkinsonism. RESULTS: The Italian SHAPS proved to be easy to 
      understand as regards the question and answer modes. Intraclass coefficient for 
      test-retest reliability was 0.65 for the total score. KR index was 0.61. ANOVA of 
      the SHAPS total score revealed that scores were higher in dPD patients than in 
      healthy controls and nPD (p<0.05). In the 1307 patients with various types of 
      parkinsonism, the SHAPS data showed that anhedonia was related to age, type of 
      parkinsonism, apathy, depression and cognitive impairment. Anhedonia was 
      correlated with frontal dysfunctions in supranuclear palsy and PD patients 
      (r=-0.682 and -0.264 respectively, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The Italian version of 
      the SHAPS is a reliable tool with which to assess anhedonia in patients with PD 
      and other forms of parkinsonism.

TI  - DSM-IV Major Depressive Episode in the elderly: the relationship between the 
      number and the type of depressive symptoms and impairment.
PG  - 55-62
LID - 10.1016/j.jad.2008.12.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of studies that assess whether the DSM-IV criteria 
      for Major Depressive Episode (MDE) that use a diagnostic threshold are valid for 
      the elderly and whether each symptom of depression contributes equally to 
      impairment in this group. METHOD: The Australian National Survey of Mental Health 
      and Wellbeing is a population-based epidemiological survey which utilized the 
      Composite International Diagnostic Instrument to diagnose MDE. Analyses were 
      based on the survey respondents who endorsed either (or both) the "depressed 
      mood" or "loss of interest" core MDE symptoms (60+ years, n=278; 40+ years, 
      n=1020). A series of multivariate linear regression analyses were run to assess 
      the relationship between the number and the type of depressive symptoms and five 
      measures of impairment. RESULTS: For those aged 60+ years, a linear relationship 
      alone was observed for the relationship between the number of depressive symptoms 
      and each of the five measures but not all symptoms of depression were equal 
      predictors of impairment; loss of energy was the most consistent predictor. When 
      the regression analyses were repeated using respondents aged 40+ years, 
      consistent significant interactions between age and individual symptoms of 
      depression were not observed. LIMITATIONS: The dimensionality of MDE is assessed 
      focusing solely on symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our data illustrate the apparent 
      dimensional structure of MDE and the differential impact of depressive symptoms 
      on impairment in an elderly sub-sample. There was little support for systematic 
      age-dependent changes. Adjustments to the diagnostic criteria of MDE may not 
      require age-dependent distinctions.

TI  - Cognitive coping and goal adjustment in people with Peripheral Arterial Disease: 
      relationships with depressive symptoms.
PG  - 132-7
LID - 10.1016/j.pec.2008.11.009 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study relationships between cognitive coping 
      strategies, goal adjustment processes (goal disengagement and re-engagement) and 
      symptoms of depression in people with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD). METHODS: 
      The sample consisted of 88 patients with PAD. Strategies of cognitive coping, 
      goal disengagement, goal re-engagement, and depression were measured by written 
      questionnaires. The main statistical methods were Pearson correlations and 
      Multiple Regression Analyses. RESULTS: The results showed that a ruminative and 
      catastrophizing way of coping in response to the disabilities was related to more 
      depressive symptoms in this group. In contrast, coping by seeking and re-engaging 
      in alternative, meaningful goals was related to less depressive symptoms. 
      CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that improvements in cognitive and 
      goal-related coping strategies might reduce the level or risk of depressive 
      symptomatology. This confirms the need for specific intervention programs that 
      bring about effective changes in the coping strategies of people suffering from 
      PAD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: As both cognitive and goal-related coping are 
      generally assumed to be mechanisms that are subject to potential influence and 
      change, the results of this study provide important targets for such an 
      intervention.

TI  - The syndromal validity and nosological position of apathy in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 1211-6
LID - 10.1002/mds.22577 [doi]
AB  - Although apathy is among the most frequent behavioral changes in Parkinson's 
      disease (PD), its diagnosis is still problematic, and the overlap with depression 
      and dementia poorly studied. Aim of the study was validate specific criteria to 
      diagnose apathy in PD, and to examine its association with subsyndromes of 
      depression and dementia. A series of 164 patients with PD, 44 patients with 
      "primary" depression and no PD, 23 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 26 
      age-comparable healthy controls underwent a comprehensive psychiatric assessment 
      that included a structured psychiatric interview and the Apathy Scale. A set of 
      seven diagnostic criteria showed high sensitivity and specificity for clinically 
      diagnosed apathy. Fifty-two of the 164 patients with PD (32%) met diagnostic 
      criteria for apathy. Eighty-three percent of patients with apathy had comorbid 
      depression and 56% had dementia. Only 5 of the 40 PD patients (13%) with neither 
      depression nor dementia had apathy. We validated a set of standardized criteria 
      for the diagnosis of apathy in PD. About one third of a series of patients 
      attending a Movement Disorders Clinic showed apathy. Both depression and dementia 
      were the most frequent comorbid conditions of apathy in PD.

TI  - Pattern of behavioral disturbances in corticobasal degeneration syndrome and 
      progressive supranuclear palsy.
PG  - 463-8
LID - 10.1017/S1041610209008862 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A careful characterization of behavioral abnormalities in 
      corticobasal degeneration syndrome (CBDS) and progressive supranuclear palsy 
      (PSP) by reliable tools is still lacking. Literature data provided evidence of 
      the usefulness of the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) to operationalize such 
      disturbances, particularly in the frontotemporal lobar degeneration spectrum. The 
      study aimed to evaluate the frequency and pattern of presentation of behavioral 
      disturbances in a large sample of CBDS and PSP patients by FBI. METHODS: 
      Sixty-eight CBDS and 57 PSP patients entered the study and underwent a 
      standardized clinical and neuropsychological battery, and a structural brain 
      imaging study. Behavioral disturbances were carefully analyzed by FBI. RESULTS: 
      FBI scores were relatively low in both groups, being 6.7 +/- 8.2 and 5.6 +/- 6.1 
      in CBDS and PSP, respectively. Comparison of the behavioral profile between CBDS 
      and PSP patients showed significant differences in apathy were more frequent in 
      the latter (57.9% vs. 33.8%, P = 0.007), and the presence of alien hand/apraxia 
      more frequent in the former group 39.7% vs. 10.5%, P = 0.001). Apathy correlated 
      neither with age nor with motor disturbances as measured by UPDRS-III. Overall, 
      the most frequent behavioral abnormalities present in both groups (>25%) were 
      aspontaneity and logopenia. Aphasia (27.9%) and irritability (35.3%) were more 
      frequent in CBDS compared to PSP, even if not statistically different. 
      DISCUSSION: The present study has provided measures of behavioral disturbances in 
      a population of PSP and CBDS patients, and further confirms the usefulness of the 
      FBI scale.

      disease.
PG  - 379-82
LID - 10.1016/j.parkreldis.2008.09.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Parkinson's disease (PD) it has been suggested that various motor 
      subtypes are also characterized by a different prevalence and severity of 
      specific non-motor symptoms such as cognitive deterioration, depression, apathy 
      and hallucinations. The aim of this study was to investigate the association 
      between motor subtypes and psychopathology in PD. METHODS: An exploratory and 
      confirmatory cluster analysis of motor and psychopathological symptoms was 
      performed with a randomized sample of 173 patients each, stemming from two 
      research databases: one from Stavanger University Hospital and one from 
      Maastricht University Hospital. These databases contained data of standardized 
      assessments of patients with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, the 
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Mini-Mental State Examination. 
      RESULTS: PD patients can be accurately and reliably classified into four 
      different subtypes: rapid disease progression subtype, young-onset subtype, 
      non-tremor-dominant subtype with psychopathology and a tremor-dominant subtype. 
      Cognitive deterioration, depressive and apathetic symptoms, and hallucinations 
      all cluster within the non-tremor-dominant motor subtype, that is characterized 
      by hypokinesia, rigidity, postural instability and gait disorder. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study shows that non-tremor-dominant PD is associated with cognitive 
      deterioration, depression, apathy, and hallucinations, which has implications for 
      future research into the pathophysiology of psychopathology in PD.

TI  - How cautious should we be when assessing apathy with the Unified Parkinson's 
      Disease Rating Scale?
PG  - 684-8
LID - 10.1002/mds.22437 [doi]
AB  - Current practice often assesses apathy with a single item from the Unified 
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS, item 4). Yet, the relationship between 
      the UPDRS item 4 and the validated Apathy Scale (AS) is unknown. The purpose of 
      this study was to evaluate the operating characteristics of UPDRS item 4 in 
      relation to the AS. Three hundred and one patients with PD were administered the 
      AS and the UPDRS. We compared the UPDRS item 4 to the standard AS classification 
      of > or =14 as apathetic. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was 
      obtained, and sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive power 
      were calculated. The ROC curve showed area under the curve as 0.75. A cut-off of 
      1 had good sensitivity (81%) but poor specificity (53%; high false positive 
      rate). A cut-off point of 2 had acceptable specificity (87%) but poor sensitivity 
      (52%, high false negative rate). Continuing to increasing the cut-off point 
      (e.g., 3, 4) continues to increase specificity at the expense of dramatically 
      reducing sensitivity. These findings suggest the use of caution when screening 
      for apathy with item 4 due to its poor sensitivity in relation to the AS.

TI  - Examination of the Lille Apathy Rating Scale in Parkinson disease.
PG  - 677-83
LID - 10.1002/mds.22441 [doi]
AB  - Apathy is a unique, multidimensional syndrome commonly encountered in patients 
      with Parkinson disease (PD). Recently, the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS), a 
      semistructured interview yielding a global score, and composite subscores for 
      different domains of apathy (i.e., cognitive, behavioral, affective, self 
      awareness), was developed and given to a sample of patients with PD in France. 
      This study is the first outside of its original developers to examine the English 
      language version of the LARS in PD. We found the LARS to be a coherent instrument 
      demonstrating both convergent and divergent validity, as compared to the Apathy 
      Scale (AS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Using a receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) analysis comparing the LARS to the AS, a validated and 
      widely-used measure, we identified a cut-off score (sensitivity = 64%, 
      specificity = 92%, PPV = 88%, NPV = 75%) that was higher than that proposed by 
      the original authors, who derived their cut-off by comparing LARS global scores 
      to clinical judgments of apathy. Although the present study does not compare the 
      LARS to a diagnostic gold standard or promote its utility for diagnosing apathy, 
      it provides further support for the LARS as a promising instrument to examine 
      apathy in PD.

TI  - [Motivational orientation and depressive symptoms in the elderly].
PG  - 115-20
LID - 10.1016/j.encep.2008.03.006 [doi]
AB  - This article is focused on motivation and depression in later life. For about 20 
      years, research on the motivation of elders has underlined the importance of the 
      cognitive evaluation of life contexts, notably in terms of self-determination. 
      This cognitive evaluation determines the motivational orientation for daily 
      activities (notably the levels of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation). The 
      purpose of this research was specifically to study the relationships between the 
      existence of four types of motivation (intrinsic, self-determined extrinsic, 
      nonself-determined extrinsic and amotivation) and the consequences for adaptation 
      and well-being. The study, therefore, focused on the possible links between 
      motivation and geriatric-depression level and explored the nature of this link. 
      Forty persons aged 60 or over (31 women: 80.48+/-9.24; nine men: 80.56+/-9.48) 
      who live in nursing homes (20 elderly) or in their own homes (20 elderly) were 
      enrolled. Elderly persons were assessed with specific and standardized tools: the 
      Elderly Motivation Scale (EMS, in the French version: EMPA) and the Geriatric 
      Depression Scale (GDS). For the statistical analyses of the results, correlations 
      and Mann-Whitney test were used. We found that in elderly people, the 
      motivational styles (the four types of motivation) can be reliably measured and 
      are related to geriatric depression. First, significant positive links were 
      noticed between intrinsic motivation and depression scores and between 
      self-determined extrinsic motivation and depression scores. Conversely, 
      significant negative links were noticed between nonself-determined extrinsic 
      motivation and depression scores and between amotivation and depression scores. 
      The most self-determined elders presented low-depression levels, whereas the more 
      nonself-determined elders showed high-depression levels. Moreover, motivational 
      styles significantly differed in the two groups (depressive or not depressive). 
      The most depressive elders showed significantly lower-intrinsic and 
      self-determined motivation levels. Our results support the hypothesis that 
      motivational styles are related to important aspects (adaptation, well-being and 
      depression) of the life of elderly people. Self-determination theory appears of 
      high interest in research on aging and especially on the determinants of 
      well-being in the elders.

TI  - Development of a simple scoring tool in the primary care setting for prediction 
      of recurrent falls in men and women aged 65 years and over living in the 
      community.
PG  - 1038-48
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2008.02591.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: We documented the number of falls and falls risk profile over two years to 
      derive a falls risks prediction score. BACKGROUND: Simple falls risk assessment 
      tools not requiring equipment or trained personnel may be used as a first step in 
      the primary care setting to identify older people at risk who may be referred for 
      further falls risk assessment in special clinics. DESIGN: Survey. METHOD: Men (n 
      = 1941) and 1949 women aged 65 years and over living in the community were 
      followed up for two years to document the number of falls. Information was 
      collected regarding demography, socioeconomic status, medical history, functional 
      limitations, lifestyle factors and psychosocial functioning. Measurements include 
      body mass index, grip strength and stride length. Logistic regression was used to 
      determine significant predictions of falls and to calculate predictive scores. 
      RESULT: Twelve factors in men and nine factors in women were used to construct a 
      risk score. The AUC of the receiver operating characteristic curve was >0.70 for 
      both men and women and a cut off score of >or=8 gave sensitivity and specificity 
      values between 60-78%. The factors included chronic disease, drugs, functional 
      limitation, lifestyle, education and psychosocial factors. When applied to future 
      predictions, only low energy level and clumsiness in both hands in men and 
      feeling downhearted in women, were significant factors. CONCLUSIONS: A risk 
      assessment tool with a cut off score of >or=8 developed from a two-year 
      prospective study of falls may be used in the community setting as an initial 
      first step for screening out those at low risk of falls. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: A simple tool may be used in the community to screen out those at risk 
      for falls, concentrating trained healthcare professionals' time on detailed falls 
      assessment and intervention for those classified as being at risk.

PG  - 905-10
LID - 10.1212/01.wnl.0000344166.03470.f8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The frequency and impact of apathy in subcortical ischemic vascular 
      dementia (SIVD) remain undetermined. The frequency, clinical, neuropsychological, 
      and imaging correlates of apathy were assessed in a large cohort of patients with 
      cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and 
      leukoencephalopathy, a genetic model of SIVD. METHODS: Apathy was diagnosed based 
      on Neuropsychiatric Inventory assessment. Degree of disability was assessed by 
      modified Rankin scale, cognitive impairment by Mattis Dementia Rating Scale 
      (MDRS) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), autonomy by the Instrumental 
      Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale, and quality of life by SEP-59 
      self-questionnaire. Validated imaging methods were used to determine the total 
      burden of cerebral lesions. RESULTS: Among 132 patients, 54 (41%) were apathetic. 
      Apathetic patients were older than nonapathetic subjects, had a lower MMSE and 
      MDRS score, had more global disability, and were more limited in IADL. Apathetic 
      patients were more frequently depressed compared to nonapathetic patients and 
      more frequently presented additional neuropsychiatric symptoms. Multiple 
      regression modeling showed a significant and independent association between 
      apathy and a lower score of overall quality of life and between apathy and a 
      higher load of white matter and lacunar lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest 
      that apathy is common in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with 
      subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), appears in association 
      with cognitive impairment, global functional disability, and severe 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms during the course of the disease, and can occur 
      separately from depression. Apathy has an independent impact on the overall 
      quality of life in CADASIL.

TI  - A scale evaluating the emotivity and well-being of elderly (Italian acronym: 
      SVEBA): analysis of psychometric characteristics.
PG  - 77-81
LID - 10.1016/j.archger.2009.09.015 [doi]
AB  - The psychopathology in the aged is an increasing burden for the last decades of 
      the life and a large source of expenditure. An early recognition and treatment 
      could lead to reduce personal distress and improve prognosis. For the use in the 
      general practitioner (GP) office and ward settings most of the short check-lists 
      available are focused on depression symptoms. For this reason a 15 items 
      check-list, oriented to cover a wider array of symptoms, has been designed for 
      the Italian population in the '90 (called SVEBA abbreviated from its Italian 
      name). This work intended to investigate the presence of symptomatological 
      clusters in order to detect different profiles of symptoms in populations with 
      different comorbidities, in 214 home-dwelling elderly, with a mean age 80.2 
      years, referred to the geriatric memory clinic. We used the Keiser-Meyer-Olkin 
      and Bartlett tests to check for applicability of factorial analysis, then a 
      principal axis factoring extraction method was applied. The analysis identified 
      the following factors: the first, collected items related to lack of motivation 
      and initiative The second is related to the perceived "locus of control". The 
      third, collected items related to sleep disturbance. The fourth, included items 
      related to somatic complaints and anxiety. In the structure of SVEBA index is 
      possible to identify three main symptom profiles related to motivation, anxiety 
      and somatic symptoms and sleep disturbances.

TI  - Breast cancer patients on endocrine therapy reveal more symptoms when 
      self-reporting than in pivotal trials: an outcome research study.
PG  - 142-8
LID - 10.1159/000195540 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this investigation was firstly to assess the overall 
      frequency of subjectively experienced symptoms self-reported by patients 
      receiving endocrine therapy and secondly to compare these symptoms with side 
      effects assessed by clinicians in pivotal trials. METHODS: Unselected patients 
      with early and advanced breast cancer receiving endocrine therapy were approached 
      consecutively during a routine outpatient visit. They received a questionnaire 
      called Checklist for Patients with Endocrine Therapy (C-PET), a validated 
      self-assessment tool to determine prespecified symptoms associated with endocrine 
      therapy. Data on toxicity were also obtained from previously published trials. 
      RESULTS: 405 patients were approached and 373 agreed to participate in this 
      study. Some symptoms were significantly more often recorded by the women in the 
      adjuvant setting completing the C-PET than by physicians' reports in pivotal 
      trials: hot flushes/sweats (C-PET 70%, ATAC 40% and BIG1-98 38%), low energy 
      (C-PET 45%, ATAC 15% and BIG1-98 9%), fluid retention (C-PET 22% and BIG1-98 7%) 
      and vaginal dryness (C-PET 30% and BIG1-98 3%). Similar differences were observed 
      in the metastatic and adjuvant setting. CONCLUSIONS: A simple tool like the C-PET 
      questionnaire is able to reflect the treatment burden of endocrine therapies and 
      may be helpful to improve communication between patients and care providers. Some 
      symptoms were significantly more often reported by the women in the C-PET than by 
      physicians in pivotal trials.

TI  - The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Cornell Scale for 
      Depression in Dementia: a validation study with patients exhibiting early-onset 
      dementia.
PG  - 56-64
LID - 10.1097/JGP.0b013e31818b4111 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate some validity measures of Montgomery-Asberg Depression 
      Rating Scale (MADRS) and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) in 
      patients with early-onset dementia (EOD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional design. 
      SETTING: Nursing home. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 63 inpatients with EOD. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Participants were assessed for the presence of clinical depression 
      using the Provisional Diagnostic Criteria for Depression in Alzheimer Disease. 
      Caregivers were administered the MADRS and CSDD, and two subscales from the 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). RESULTS: Depressed patients had higher scores 
      on 6 of the 10 MADRS items and on 3 of the 19 CSDD items than nondepressed 
      patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a larger area 
      under the curve for MADRS (0.87) than for CSDD (0.76), the difference was 
      significant (p = 0.044). A CSDD optimal cutoff score of "5/6" yielded a 
      sensitivity of 0.833 and a specificity of 0.567. A MADRS cutoff score of "19/20" 
      yielded the highest sum of sensitivity (0.750) and specificity (0.843). A MADRS 
      score of "14/15" with almost the same sum of sensitivity and specificity had a 
      higher sum of sensitivity and a negative predictive value than "19/20." Both 
      scales correlated with the NPI subscales depression/dysphoria (MADRS: rs = 0.70; 
      CSDD: rs = 0.62) and apathy/indifference (MADRS: rs = 0.59; CSDD: rs = 0.50). 
      CONCLUSION: The MADRS and CSDD performed well in distinguishing depressed from 
      nondepressed EOD patients and showed good congruent validity. The scales may be 
      used to assess depressive symptoms in EOD. The MADRS intensity grades may be used 
      for development or refinement of depression scales in (early onset) dementia.

TI  - New insights in symptom assessment: the Chinese Versions of the Memorial Symptom 
      Assessment Scale Short Form (MSAS-SF) and the Condensed MSAS (CMSAS).
PG  - 584-95
LID - 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.12.008 [doi]
AB  - There are very few symptom assessment instruments in Chinese. We present the 
      validity and reliability of the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale Short Form 
      (MSAS-SF) and the Condensed Form MSAS (CMSAS) in Chinese cancer patients. The 
      Chinese version of the 32-item MSAS-SF, a self-report measure for assessing 
      symptom distress and frequency in cancer patients, was administered to 256 
      Chinese patients with colorectal cancer at a clinical oncology outpatient unit. 
      Highly prevalent symptoms included worrying (59%), dry mouth (54%), lack of 
      energy (54%), feeling sad (48%), feeling irritable (48%), and pain (41%). Both 
      the MSAS-SF and CMSAS demonstrated good validity and reliability. For the MSAS-SF 
      subscales, Cronbach alphas ranged from 0.84 to 0.91, and for CMSAS subscales, 
      from 0.79 to 0.87. Moderate-to-high correlations of MSAS-SF and CMSAS subscales 
      with appropriate European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
      (EORTC) QLQ-C30 subscales (0.42-0.71, Ps<0.001) indicated acceptable convergent 
      validity. Low correlations with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem and Optimism Scale 
      (0.22, P<0.001) indicated divergent validity. MSAS subscales varied as expected 
      with other Chinese scales--the Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ) and the Life 
      Orientation Scale. Construct validity of both MSAS versions was demonstrated by 
      effective differentiation between clinically distinct patient groups (Karnofsky 
      scores <80% vs. > or =80% [P<0.001]; no active treatment vs. active treatment 
      [P<0.002-0.034]; CHQ-12 scores < or =4 vs. CHQ-12 scores >4 [P<0.001]). The 
      Number of Symptoms subscale correlated appropriately with the EORTC QLQ-C30 
      function (-0.46 to -0.60, P<0.001) and symptom scales (0.31-0.64, P<0.001). The 
      average time to complete the MSAS-SF was six minutes. The Chinese versions of the 
      MSAS-SF and CMSAS are valid and practical measures. Further validation is needed 
      for Chinese patients with other cancer types and with other symptom instruments.

PG  - 675-83
LID - 10.1080/13607860801972412 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This investigation examined the associations between self-reports, 
      collateral-source reports and a clinician's diagnosis of depression in persons 
      with cognitive impairment. METHOD: Responses on the Geriatric Depression Scale - 
      15 (GDS-15) from 162 participants with a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment 
      (n = 78) or Alzheimer's Dementia and a Mini-Mental State score >or=15 (n = 84) 
      were compared with both their collateral sources' report on either the 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (n = 93) and/or the collateral-source 
      GDS-15 (n = 67), or a clinician's diagnosis of Major Depression (MD). RESULTS: 
      Significant differences were seen between self- versus collateral-source reports 
      of depression in these participants. Participants' reports of loss of interest 
      (anhedonia) significantly increased the odds of disagreement with their 
      collateral sources (OR = 3.78, 95% CI: 1.3-11.2) while reports of negative 
      cognitions significantly decreased the odds of such a disagreement (OR = 0.31, 
      95% CI: 0.1-0.9). The symptom of anhedonia also showed the strongest association 
      with the clinician's diagnosis of MD. CONCLUSION: A motivational symptom like 
      loss of interest was seen to play an important role in depression experienced by 
      those with cognitive impairment.

TI  - Patient ethnicity and perceptions of families and friends regarding depression 
      treatment.
PG  - 465-78
LID - 10.1080/13557850802023125 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Black Americans are less likely than white Americans to seek 
      professional treatment for depression. Whether treatment recommendations are 
      sought and implemented by patients will be influenced by the role families and 
      friends play in diagnostic acceptance and treatment decisions. We investigated 
      the association of ethnicity with the perceived need for treatment of depression 
      by family and friends of older primary care patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional 
      survey of 355 older adults with and without significant depressive symptoms was 
      conducted. At the baseline visit, family and friends' ratings of apathy and need 
      for depression treatment were obtained on 314 of the 355 patients (88% response 
      rate) and examined according to ethnicity. Participants were interviewed using 
      standardized measures of chronic medical conditions, functional status, and 
      psychological status. RESULTS: Older black patients compared to older white 
      patients were less likely to be rated as needing depression treatment by their 
      family and friends (odds ratio (OR) = 0.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.18, 
      0.64]) adjusting for depressive symptoms, cognition, functional status, and other 
      potentially influential characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that 
      patient ethnicity may play a role in a family member's or friend's perceived need 
      for depression treatment of older adults who present in the primary care setting. 
      Further study of attitudes, expectations, and values of patients and family 
      members or friends in primary care settings may help elucidate the interplay of 
      physician, patient, and family member or friend.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed at exploring some of the facets of psychological 
      distress during aging, and at validating an inventory, the Cognitive Inventory of 
      Subjective Distress (CISD) for assessing this kind of distress. METHODS: An 
      inventory of thoughts representing distress schemas was administered to 298 
      elderly subjects living at home or in a center. RESULTS: Factor analyses 
      suggested retaining 29 items. They explained 62% of the total variance and 
      corresponded to seven distinct facets: abandonment, dependency, disengagement, 
      fear of losing control, loss of individuality, refusal of help, and 
      vulnerability. These dimensions turned out to be relatively independent of each 
      other and moderately correlated with measures of depression and anxiety. The 
      internal consistency and temporal reliability of the seven scales are good. 
      CONCLUSION: The CISD is an original tool for assessing psychological distress. It 
      is geared to old and very old individuals living in a center for the elderly, and 
      its design takes the fatiguability and cognitive heterogeneity of this population 
      into account. This inventory can also be used for psychopathological assessment 
      and can serve as a baseline for following patients over time or in the course of 
      therapy.

TI  - The metric properties of Zarit caregiver burden scale: validation study of a 
      Chinese version.
PG  - 321-6
LID - 10.1097/WAD.0b013e3181902334 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the Chinese version of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) as 
      an instrument for measuring strain in Chinese caregivers of elderly people with 
      dementia. DESIGN AND METHODS: The objective of the present study was to carry out 
      a metric analysis of a Chinese version of ZBI using a cross-sectional study. 
      Patients and their caregivers completed a variety of questionnaires, including 
      the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), 
      the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). 
      Cronbach alpha coefficient was used to assess inter-item consistency, and a split 
      half correlation coefficient was used to determine the internal consistency of 
      the ZBI. Correlations between the ZBI and GDS, and the ZBI and HAMA were assessed 
      for convergent validity. Correlations of the ZBI and MMSE, the ZBI and NPI were 
      also calculated to evaluate the possible correlation of caregiver burden with the 
      severity of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: There 
      were 42 patients with dementia in the study. The intraclass correlation 
      coefficient was 0.89 and the split half correlation coefficient was 0.87. The 
      mean ZBI score was 24.40+/-14.68. Item-total (corrected) correlation showed 
      significant coefficients (rs>0.33, P<0.05) for most items. There was a 
      significant correlation between the ZBI and GDS (rs=0.57, P<0.001), and between 
      the ZBI and HAMA (rs=0.44, P=0.003). Furthermore, there was a significant 
      positive correlation between the ZBI and NPI, the ZBI and the agitation score, 
      the ZBI and the apathy score, and the ZBI and MMSE. CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese 
      version of ZBI meets some of the basic reliability and validity standards 
      required for health status measures. Further studies could lead to a better 
      understanding of the difficulties experienced by caregivers of patients suffering 
      from dementia in China.

TI  - Prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in mild cognitive impairment and normal 
      cognitive aging: population-based study.
PG  - 1193-8
LID - 10.1001/archpsyc.65.10.1193 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Little is known about the population-based prevalence of 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). OBJECTIVE: To 
      estimate the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in MCI and normal cognitive 
      aging in a defined population. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study derived from an 
      ongoing population-based prospective cohort study. SETTING: The Mayo Clinic Study 
      of Aging. PARTICIPANTS: We studied a random sample of 1969 individuals without 
      dementia from the target population of 9965 elderly persons residing in Olmsted 
      County (Minnesota) on the prevalence date (October 1, 2004). Neuropsychiatric 
      data were available for 319 of 329 subjects with MCI (97.0%) and 1590 of 1640 
      subjects with normal cognition (97.0%). Neurologic, cognitive, and 
      neuropsychiatric data were obtained from the study participants. A classification 
      of MCI, dementia, and normal cognitive aging was adjudicated by an expert 
      consensus panel. Accordingly, 329 subjects were classified as having MCI and the 
      remaining 1640 subjects were classified as having normal cognition. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE: Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire score. RESULTS: Multivariate 
      logistic regression analyses were conducted after adjusting for age, sex, and 
      educational status. By considering both the odds ratio (OR) and the frequency of 
      a symptom, the most distinguishing features between the 2 groups were apathy (OR, 
      4.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.11-6.60; P < .001), agitation (3.60; 
      2.18-5.92; P < .001), anxiety (3.00; 2.01-4.48; P < .001), irritability 2.99; 
      2.11-4.22; P < .001), and depression (2.78; 2.06-3.76; P < .001). The OR was 
      highest for delusion (8.12; 95% CI, 2.92-22.60; P < .001); however, it was rare 
      in both subjects with MCI (11 of 319 [3.4%]) and those with normal cognition (6 
      of 1590 [0.4%]). Thus, the population attributable risk for delusion was only 
      2.62% compared with 14.60% for apathy. CONCLUSIONS: Nonpsychotic symptoms 
      affected approximately 50% of subjects with MCI and 25% of subjects with normal 
      cognition. In contrast, psychotic symptoms were rare.

TI  - Who copes well? Obesity-related coping and its associations with shame, guilt, 
      and weight loss.
PG  - 1129-44
LID - 10.1002/jclp.20501 [doi]
AB  - The relationship among weight-related coping, guilt, and shame was investigated 
      in a sample of 98 obese German individuals over a 6-month period. In terms of the 
      objectives, the study explored the kind and frequency of typical coping 
      situations in which obese individuals become aware of being obese. Furthermore, 
      the study sought to determine the predictive utility of weight-related shame and 
      guilt concerning coping responses, and to establish whether there is an 
      association between coping responses and weight change. A longitudinal 
      examination over a 6-month period was chosen with two measurement points. As 
      typical distressing coping situations, individuals reported mostly negative 
      evaluations through others/self, physical exercise situations, or environmental 
      hazards (mainly shopping for clothes). Weight-related shame at baseline was a 
      significant negative predictor for problem-focused engagement coping, whereas 
      weight-related guilt was a significant positive predictor for problem-focused 
      engagement strategies and dietary restraint at follow-up. Although Body Mass 
      Index showed no substantial association with the coping measures, weight loss was 
      accompanied by a substantial drop in problem-focused disengagement coping 
      (wishful thinking, problem avoidance). Discussion of these findings focuses on 
      the issue of possible effects of weight-related feelings of guilt and shame on 
      coping behavior, the link between weight loss and disengaging coping strategies, 
      and the possible use of the findings for cognitive-behavioral therapy for 
      obesity.

TI  - The pattern of depressive symptoms and factor analysis of the Cornell Scale among 
      patients in Norwegian nursing homes.
PG  - 1058-65
LID - 10.1002/gps.2033 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is more prevalent in subjects with dementia than in those 
      without it. Due to both psychological and biological risk factors it is suggested 
      that a bimodal distribution of depressive symptoms exists with higher prevalence 
      rates being found among patients suffering both with mild and with severe 
      dementia. AIM: To confirm or reject the hypothesis of a bimodal distribution of 
      depressive symptoms. METHODS: A sample of 1,159 randomly selected nursing home 
      patients was assessed using the Cornell Scale, the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale 
      (CDR) and Lawton's Scale of the activities of daily living. Additionally, 
      information was collected from the patients' records. A factor analysis of the 
      Cornell Scale was performed. RESULTS: The use of antidepressants and demographic 
      characteristics, except for gender distribution, did not differ across CDR 
      groups. Patients with dementia had more symptoms such as anxiety, irritability, 
      agitation, retardation, loss of interest, lack of joy and delusion than those 
      without dementia. No symptom was more frequent among non-demented subjects. The 
      factor analysis resulted in a five factors solution: 'mood', 'cyclic', 
      'physical', 'retardation' and 'behavioural' factor. The score on the mood 
      subscale did not differ across CDR groups (p = 0.326), whereas the scores on the 
      four other subscales increased with increasing CDR scores (p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: We did not find a bimodal distribution of depressive symptoms. The 
      explanation for the occurrence of the typical core symptoms of depression, the 
      mood symptoms, is probably complex. The non-mood symptoms are probably strongly 
      influenced by biological factors.

      adults.

AB  - Older adults report less distress in response to interpersonal conflicts than do 
      younger adults, yet few researchers have examined factors that may contribute to 
      these age differences. Emotion regulation is partially determined by the initial 
      cognitive and emotional reactions that events elicit. The authors examined 
      reported thoughts and emotions of younger and older adults (N = 195) while they 
      listened to 3 different audiotaped conversations in which people were ostensibly 
      making disparaging remarks about them. At 4 points during each scenario, the tape 
      paused and participants engaged in a talk-aloud procedure and rated their level 
      of anger and sadness. Findings reveal that older adults reported less anger but 
      equal levels of sadness compared to younger adults, and their comments were 
      judged by coders as less negative. Older adults made fewer appraisals about the 
      people speaking on the tape and expressed less interest in learning more about 
      their motives. Together, findings are consistent with age-related increases in 
      processes that promote disengagement from offending situations.

TI  - The impact of symptoms and impairments on overall health in US national health 
      data.
PG  - 954-62
LID - 10.1097/MLR.0b013e318179199f [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects on overall self-rated health of the broad range 
      of symptoms and impairments that are routinely asked about in national surveys. 
      DATA: We use data from adults in the nationally representative Medical 
      Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) 2002 with validation in an independent sample 
      from MEPS 2000. METHODS: Regression analysis is used to relate impairments and 
      symptoms to a 100-point self-rating of general health status. The effect of each 
      impairment and symptom on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is estimated 
      from regression coefficients, accounting for interactions between them. RESULTS: 
      Impairments and symptoms most strongly associated with overall health include 
      pain, self-care limitations, and having little or no energy. The most prevalent 
      are moderate pain, severe anxiety, moderate depressive symptoms, and low energy. 
      Effects are stable across different waves of MEPS, and questions cover a broader 
      range of impairments and symptoms than existing health measurement instruments. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This method makes use of the rich detail on impairments and symptoms 
      in existing national data, quantifying their independent effects on overall 
      health. Given the ongoing availability of these data and the shortcomings of 
      traditional utility methods, it would be valuable to compare existing HRQOL 
      measures to other methods, such as the one presented herein, for use in tracking 
      population health over time.

TI  - Frailty in older Mexican-American and European-American adults: is there an 
      ethnic disparity?
PG  - 1744-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.01845.x [doi]
AB  - Because conventional frailty screening criteria have been standardized in 
      predominantly European-American (EA) cohorts, applying them to ethnically diverse 
      populations may result in inaccurate estimation of frailty prevalence in ethnic 
      minorities. The objective of this study was to determine whether use of 
      ethnic-specific criteria (EC) to characterize frailty in a bi-ethnic cohort 
      results in significant differences in frailty prevalence when compared with the 
      prevalence obtained using conventional criteria (CC). Data were from a random 
      sample of community-dwelling Mexican Americans (MAs) (n=394) and EAs (n=355) aged 
      65 to 80 who participated in the baseline examination of the San Antonio 
      Longitudinal Study of Aging. Frailty was defined as three or more of five 
      characteristics: slow walking speed, weak grip strength, low energy expenditure, 
      self-reported exhaustion, and weight loss. For CC, walking speed was standardized 
      to height and sex, grip strength was standardized to body mass index and sex, and 
      energy expenditure was standardized to sex using the pooled sample. For EC, these 
      criteria were applied within each ethnic group. Frailty prevalence in MAs and EAs 
      was compared using chi-square statistic. Using CC, a higher proportion of MAs 
      than EAs were frail (11.3% vs 7.0%, P=.045). Using EC, there was no difference in 
      frailty prevalence between MAs and EAs (9.9% in both ethnic groups). The 
      application of conventional frailty screening criteria in a bi-ethnic cohort 
      results in a higher prevalence of frailty in MAs than in EAs. In determining 
      whether there are ethnic disparities in frailty, future studies should carefully 
      consider whether CC or EC should be applied.

      Questionnaire (SEQ-12) among Chinese cardiac patients who smoke.
PG  - 1311-8
LID - 10.1080/14622200802238928 [doi]
AB  - Smoking cessation can reduce both morbidity and mortality among patients who have 
      heart disease. China has the largest number of smokers in the world, and most 
      smokers have low motivation to quit. Regular smoking cessation services are 
      almost nonexistent in China, and little is known about the psychometric 
      properties of instruments in assessing smoking self-efficacy in Chinese, whose 
      cultures differ greatly from those of Westerners. The present study tested the 
      psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Smoking Self-Efficacy 
      Questionnaire (SEQ-12) among 1,841 Chinese smokers who had heart disease, 
      including (a) factorial structure using confirmatory factor analysis, (b) 
      reliability with Cronbach's alpha, (c) concurrent validity, and (d) predictive 
      validity of successful quitting. Confirmatory factor analysis of the SEQ-12 
      revealed a modified two-factor model that provided a good fit to the data; item 6 
      ("urge to smoke") was an indicator for the external stimuli subscale rather than 
      for the internal stimuli subscale. Internal consistency coefficients (.77 for 
      external stimuli and .88 for internal stimuli) were acceptable. Baseline 
      self-efficacy scores were significantly associated positively with stage of 
      readiness to quit, and negatively with cigarettes smoked per day and Fagerstrom 
      Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) score. Multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis showed that successful quitting at 1 month and at 3 months were 
      predicted by higher external stimuli score, fewer cigarettes smoked per day, 
      lower FTND scores, and being in the intervention group. We concluded that the 
      Chinese version of the SEQ-12 is a valid and reliable instrument for Chinese 
      cardiac patients who smoke. The SEQ-12 can be used to assess smokers' 
      self-efficacy so that appropriate smoking cessation interventions can be 
      provided.

TI  - Why don't you exercise? Development of the Amotivation Toward Exercise Scale 
      among older inactive individuals.
PG  - 316-41
AB  - This article reports on the development and initial validation of the Amotivation 
      Toward Exercise Scale (ATES), which reflects a taxonomy of older adults' reasons 
      to refrain from exercise. Drawing on work by Pelletier, Dion, Tuson, and 
      Green-Demers (1999) and Legault, Green-Demers, and Pelletier (2006), these 
      dimensions were the outcome beliefs, capacity beliefs, effort beliefs, and value 
      amotivation beliefs toward exercise. The results supported a 4-factor correlated 
      model that fit the data better than either a unidimensional model or a 4-factor 
      uncorrelated model or a hierarchical model with strong internal reliability for 
      all the subscales. Evidence also emerged for the discriminant validity of the 
      subscale scores. Furthermore, the predictive validity of the subscale scores was 
      supported, and satisfactory measurement invariance was demonstrated across the 
      calibration and validation samples, supporting the generalizability of the 
      scale's measurement properties.

TI  - Methylphenidate for the treatment of apathy in Alzheimer disease: prediction of 
      response using dextroamphetamine challenge.
PG  - 296-301
LID - 10.1097/JCP.0b013e318172b479 [doi]
AB  - Apathy is a common behavioral symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD), being present 
      in up to 70% of patients. Apathy in AD and non-AD populations has been associated 
      with dysfunction in the dopaminergic brain reward system, suggesting that 
      pharmacotherapeutic targeting of this system may be an effective treatment for 
      apathy in AD. We therefore performed a randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled crossover trial of methylphenidate in a sample of 13 apathetic 
      AD patients (6 men, 7 women; age mean 77.9 years [SD, 7.8 years]; Mini Mental 
      Status Examination score, 19.9 [SD, 4.7]). Patients were treated with 
      methylphenidate (10 mg PO twice a day) or an identical placebo in two 2-week 
      phases separated by a 1-week placebo washout. All patients participated in a 
      dextroamphetamine challenge test (one 10-mg oral dose) before treatment with 
      methylphenidate to gauge the functional integrity of the dopamine brain reward 
      system. Overall, patients demonstrated greater improvement with methylphenidate 
      compared with placebo according to Apathy Evaluation Scale total change scores 
      (end of treatment - baseline: Wilcoxon Z = -2.00; P = 0.047). However, a 
      significantly greater proportion of patients experienced at least 1 adverse event 
      with methylphenidate compared with placebo (3 vs 1; chi = 4.33, P = 0.038). Two 
      patients experienced serious adverse events with methylphenidate, consisting of 
      delusions, agitation, anger, irritability, and insomnia, which resolved upon 
      discontinuation of the medication. Response to methylphenidate was associated 
      with increases in inattention on a continuous performance task after 
      dextroamphetamine challenge. Psychostimulants may be effective in treating 
      features of apathy in AD, and dopaminergic changes may predict response.

TI  - Physical symptoms that predict psychiatric disorders in rural primary care

AB  - RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: There is a robust association between physical 
      symptoms and mental distress, but recognition rates of psychiatric disorders by 
      primary care doctors are low. We investigated patient-reported physical symptoms 
      as predictors of concurrent psychiatric disorders in rural primary care adult 
      outpatients. METHOD: A convenience sample of 1092 patients were assessed with a 
      two-stage diagnostic system consisting of a brief screening questionnaire and a 
      clinician-administered semi-structured interview that linked common physical 
      symptoms with the concurrent presence of psychiatric disorders. RESULTS: 
      Somatoform physical symptoms were highly predictive of the concurrent presence of 
      a psychiatric disorder, with odds ratios ranging from 10.4 (fainting spells) to 
      54.6 (shortness of breath). Aggregate analysis of somatoform and non-somatoform 
      symptoms relative to no physical symptom produced odds ratios of 3.0 or higher 
      for headaches, chest pain, dizziness, sleep problem, shortness of breath, tired 
      or low energy, and fainting spells. As the number of symptoms (especially 
      somatoform) increased, the odds of a psychiatric disorder increased. CONCLUSION: 
      Although individual physical symptoms are valid triggers for suspecting a 
      psychiatric disorder, the most powerful correlates are total number of physical 
      complaints and somatoform symptom status.

TI  - The Lille Apathy Rating Scale: validation of a caregiver-based version.
PG  - 845-9
LID - 10.1002/mds.21968 [doi]
AB  - Apathy is reported in 16.5% to 70% of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Our 
      recently developed Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) has been specifically 
      validated for patient-based assessment of apathy in PD. The aim of the present 
      study was to validate a caregiver-based version of the LARS. Sixty consecutive PD 
      patients and their respective caregivers participated in the study. An 
      informant-based version of the LARS (LARS-i) was developed to rate apathy via a 
      caregiver-based structured interview. Apathy was also assessed in a patient-based 
      interview using the LARS and the informant- and clinician-rated versions of the 
      Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). Cronbach's alpha and standardized alpha 
      coefficients were 0.872 and 0.877, respectively, and the split-half reliability 
      was 0.901 (revealing good internal consistency). The test-retest and inter-rater 
      reliability values were 0.960 and 0.996, respectively. Criterion-related validity 
      (according to an independent, expert diagnosis) was good. Scores on the LARS and 
      the LARS-i were highly correlated. However, apathy was rated significantly more 
      severely by the caregiver than by the patient. This difference was significantly 
      higher for demented than nondemented PD patients. The LARS-i was seen to have 
      excellent psychometric properties and appears to be valid for use in PD with 
      respect to the patient-based LARS and the informant- and clinician-rated versions 
      of the AES.

      of dementia.
PG  - 158-62
LID - 10.1097/WAD.0b013e3181630b6f [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Music therapy (MT) has been proposed as valid approach for behavioral 
      and psychologic symptoms (BPSD) of dementia. However, studies demonstrating the 
      effectiveness of this approach are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To assess MT effectiveness 
      in reducing BPSD in subjects with dementia. METHOD: Fifty-nine persons with 
      dementia were enrolled in this study. All of them underwent a multidimensional 
      assessment including Mini Mental State Examination, Barthel Index and 
      Neuropsychiatry Inventory at enrollment and after 8, 16, and 20 weeks. Subjects 
      were randomly assigned to experimental (n=30) or control (n=29) group. The MT 
      sessions were evaluated with standardized criteria. The experimental group 
      received 30 MT sessions (16 wk of treatment), whereas the control group received 
      educational support or entertainment activities. RESULTS: NPI total score 
      significantly decreased in the experimental group at 8th, 16th, and 20th weeks 
      (interaction time x group: F3,165=5.06, P=0.002). Specific BPSD (ie, delusions, 
      agitation, anxiety, apathy, irritability, aberrant motor activity, and night-time 
      disturbances) significantly improved. The empathetic relationship and the 
      patients' active participation in the MT approach, also improved in the 
      experimental group. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that MT is effective to reduce 
      BPSD in patients with moderate-severe dementia.

TI  - [Assessment of participation in psychogeriatric day care].
PG  - 55-63
AB  - Participants in psychogeriatric day care differ in their ability to enjoy the 
      activities and to be engaged in the day care program. In order to reveal 
      individual differences in the quality of participant engagement, an 18-item 
      questionnaire was drafted and completed for 126 visitors of a psychogeriatric day 
      care centre. Scalability of the items was tested according to criteria of 
      nonparametric item response theory (IRT). Construct validity was determined by 
      comparing the results with independent behaviour ratings of cognitive impairment 
      and apathy, and scores on the Amsterdam Dementia Screening Test (ADS), a 
      neuropsychological test of multiple cognitive domains. Nine items formed a strong 
      primary Participation Scale with a coefficient H of 0.63. Behaviour ratings of 
      cognitive impairment and apathy were significant predictors of the participation 
      score. The same was true for the subtests Design Copying and Category Fluency of 
      the ADS. Two meaningful small secondary scales were found, representing 
      motivation and emotional stability, which add to the predominantly cognitive 
      content of the primary scale. Total scores of the secondary scales correlated 
      with affective parameters, but not with cognitive indices. The Participation 
      Scale deserves to be expanded with items referring to motivation and emotional 
      experience.

TI  - Reliability of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
      (NPI) for patients with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.
PG  - 383-93
LID - 10.1017/S1041610207006254 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioral symptoms and caregivers' responses may differ among 
      various ethnic and cultural groups. Therefore it is important to have a reliable 
      instrument to assess behavioral disturbances of dementia in various cultures. The 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) has been widely used in many countries. To date 
      there has been no reliability study of this instrument in Brazil. METHODS: The 
      psychometric properties of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the NPI were 
      studied in a sample of 36 Alzheimer's disease (AD) outpatients from southern 
      Brazil. Test-retest, inter-rater reliability and internal consistency were 
      estimated. The profile of neuropsychiatric symptoms and caregiver distress were 
      also evaluated. The NPI was translated into Portuguese and then back translated 
      to English. RESULTS: The Brazilian Portuguese version of the NPI showed good 
      inter-rater and test-retest reliability with the coefficients of all scales > 
      0.85. Internal consistency was also good (Cronbach's alpha 0.70 for total 
      severity and distress). Apathy provided higher NPI scores of total severity and 
      distress. CONCLUSIONS: This NPI version was found to be a reliable instrument for 
      the evaluation of neuropsychiatric symptoms and caregiver distress due to 
      dementia in AD. The profile of behavioral disturbances was similar to that 
      observed in other countries. Severity of dementia may have biased some 
      caregivers' answers.

TI  - Unmet needs of gynaecological cancer survivors: implications for developing 
      community support services.
PG  - 392-400
AB  - After treatment completion, gynaecological cancer survivors may face long-term 
      challenges and late effects, specific to this disease. Available research on 
      supportive care needs of women with gynaecological cancer is limited. This study 
      aimed to determine the prevalence and correlates of unmet needs within a 
      population of gynaecological cancer survivors. Eight hundred and two women 
      participated in a population-based mail survey in 2004 (56% response rate). The 
      questionnaire included a validated instrument to assess 45 need items across 
      multiple supportive care domains, and a range of measures to evaluate related 
      correlates consistent with a social-ecological perspective. Forty-three per cent 
      of respondents reported having at least one moderate- or high-level unmet need. 
      The five highest included needing help with fear about the cancer spreading 
      (17%), concerns about the worries of those close to them (15%), uncertainty about 
      the future (14%), lack of energy/tiredness (14%), and not being able to do things 
      they used to do (14%). Subgroups of women with higher odds of reporting 'some' 
      unmet needs across multiple supportive care domains include those who, are not in 
      remission, live with lymphoedema or are unable to work due to illness. Odds were 
      also higher for women who had undergone more recent treatment, and who lived in 
      rural or remote locations. Further assistance with the top specific concerns of 
      gynaecological cancer survivors is recommended. Identified subgroups with higher 
      needs are important targets for support.

TI  - Apathy in late-life depression among Taiwanese patients.
PG  - 328-37
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is defined as lack of motivation and occurs in a variety of 
      neuropsychological disorders. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) has been shown to 
      be valid and reliable for assessing apathy in depression but the validity and 
      reliability of the Chinese version has never been examined. The aims of the study 
      were to (1) evaluate the validity and reliability of the Chinese version of the 
      AES in late-life depression and (2) evaluate the severity of apathy in late-life 
      depression. METHODS: We translated the AES into Chinese and used a 
      cross-sectional design to evaluate apathy in elderly subjects. Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) -IV criteria and Hamilton Depression 
      Rating Scale (HDRS) were applied for diagnosis and assessment. Three groups of 
      subjects were recruited including one group (n = 31) of patients with major 
      depressive disorder with current depression, the second group (n = 30) with major 
      depressed disorder with remission, and the third group (n = 31) of healthy 
      controls. Convergent validity was tested using four apathy-related items from the 
      HDRS (loss of interest, psychomotor retardation, loss of energy, and loss of 
      insight). Multiple forms of reliability (including internal consistency, 
      test-retest, and interrater) and discriminant validity were examined. RESULTS: We 
      demonstrated that the internal consistency (coefficient alpha = 0.90) and 
      test-retest reliability (p < 0.001) were satisfied. Discriminant validity of 
      apathy severity among these three groups was significant. The convergent validity 
      and correlation coefficients based on the four apathy-related items from the HDRS 
      and AES were acceptable. CONCLUSION: Apathy is a distinct syndrome which may be 
      treatable when depression is effective managed. Further application of the 
      Chinese version of the AES to study the association of apathy with other 
      neuropsychological symptoms is necessary.

TI  - Behavioural problems in Huntington's disease using the Problem Behaviours 
      Assessment.
PG  - 155-61
LID - 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2007.11.005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate behavioural problems in Huntington's disease (HD). 
      METHOD: In 152 HD mutation carriers and a control group of 56 noncarriers at 
      initial 50% risk, the Dutch version of the Problem Behaviours Assessment (PBA) 
      was administered. Mutation carriers were divided into three groups according to 
      the motor section of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS): 
      pre-(motor) symptomatic, early and advanced symptomatic subjects. The factor 
      structure and interrater reliability of the PBA were investigated. RESULTS: The 
      clinically relevant interrater reliability of the PBA was 0.82 for severity 
      scores and 0.73 for frequency scores. The PBA showed a three-factor solution: 
      apathy, depression and irritability. Mutation carriers, including presymptomatic 
      subjects, portrayed more apathy, depression and irritability than noncarriers. 
      Early symptomatic subjects had more apathy, but not more depression or 
      irritability, compared to presymptomatic subjects. Advanced symptomatic subjects 
      had more apathy than early symptomatic subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The PBA is a 
      reliable and sensitive instrument. Behavioural problems occur in all stages of HD 
      and arise before the onset of motor symptoms. Apathy is related to disease 
      severity, whereas depression and irritability are not. The broad clinical 
      phenotype of HD therefore requires adequate service delivery with integrated and 
      multidisciplinary patient care.

TI  - Vascular disease and apathy in old age. The Leiden 85-Plus Study.
PG  - 266-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is defined as an important loss of motivation in all domains 
      of daily functioning. Especially in old age, apathy might be a specific 
      neuropsychiatric syndrome separate from depression. There are indications that 
      apathy in elderly subjects is related to vascular disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess 
      the relation between vascular disease and apathy in subjects aged 85 years and 
      older. METHODS: The Leiden 85-plus Study is a prospective, population-based study 
      of 500 elderly subjects. Vascular disease including myocardial infarction, angina 
      pectoris or myocardial ischemia, claudicatio intermittens, and arterial surgery 
      was determined at baseline. Symptoms of apathy were assessed annually from age 85 
      through 90 years using the apathy questions of the 15-item Geriatric Depression 
      Rating Scale (GDS). Diagnostic accuracy of the apathy questions was validated 
      using the Apathy Scale at age 90 years. The association between vascular disease 
      and apathy was estimated both at baseline and longitudinally. RESULTS: The apathy 
      items of the GDS showed a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 85%. At 
      baseline, 69 subjects with apathy but free of depression had significantly more 
      cardiovascular pathologies compared to 287 subjects without apathy. In the 287 
      subjects who were free of apathy and depression, increase of apathy but not 
      depression during follow-up was significantly higher for each additional 
      cardiovascular pathology at baseline. CONCLUSION: In community dwelling elderly, 
      those with vascular disease were at higher risk of developing apathy but not 
      depression. This suggests that apathy and depression in old age have different 
      etiologies.

TI  - Point and 5-year period prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia: the 
      Cache County Study.
PG  - 170-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are nearly universal in dementia, yet 
      little is known about their longitudinal course in the community. OBJECTIVE: To 
      estimate point and 5-year period prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in an 
      incident sample of 408 dementia participants from the Cache County Study. 
      METHODS: The Neuropsychiatric Inventory assessed symptoms at baseline and at 1.5 
      years, 3.0 years, 4.1 years, and 5.3 years. Point prevalence, period prevalence 
      and mean symptom severity at each time point were estimated. RESULTS: Point 
      prevalence for delusions was 18% at baseline and 34-38% during the last three 
      visits; hallucinations, 10% at baseline and 19-24% subsequently; 
      agitation/aggression fluctuated between 13% and 24%; depression 29% at baseline 
      and 41-47% subsequently; apathy increased from 20% at baseline to 51% at 5.3 
      years; elation never rose above 1%; anxiety 14% at baseline and 24-32% 
      subsequently; disinhibition fluctuated between 2% and 15%; irritability between 
      17% and 27%; aberrant motor behavior gradually increased from 7% at baseline to 
      29% at 5.3 years. Point prevalence for any symptom was 56% at baseline and 76-87% 
      subsequently. Five-year period prevalence was greatest for depression (77%), 
      apathy (71%), and anxiety (62%); lowest for elation (6%), and disinhibition 
      (31%). Ninety-seven percent experienced at least one symptom. Symptom severity 
      was consistently highest for apathy. CONCLUSIONS: Participants were most likely 
      to develop depression, apathy, or anxiety, and least likely to develop elation or 
      disinhibition. Give converging evidence that syndromal definitions may more 
      accurately capture neuropsychiatric co-morbidity in dementia, future efforts to 
      validate such syndromes are warranted.

TI  - Patient and caregiver perspectives of quality of life in dementia. An

PG  - 138-46
LID - 10.1159/000149584 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Behavioural and psychological symptoms have a high prevalence 
      amongst patients with dementia and can be a significant source of distress to 
      both patients and carers. The present study explored the relationships between 
      quality of life and behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD) 
      from both patient and carer perspectives. Contextual factors surrounding the 
      occurrence of BPSD were explored. METHODS: Forty-six patients and 116 carers 
      completed questionnaire measures of BPSD and quality of life. RESULTS: BPSD were 
      negatively associated with both patient and carer ratings of patient quality of 
      life. The symptoms related to lower quality of life differed between patient and 
      carer ratings: depression and irritability were found to predict lower carer 
      ratings of quality of life, whilst delusions and apathy indicated lower patient 
      ratings. Carers were found to be poor at identifying antecedents and consequences 
      of BPSD. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of BPSD is associated with lower quality of 
      life in dementia. Interventions designed to improve the quality of life for 
      patients should focus on the BPSD specifically associated with the patient's 
      rating of quality of life. Information regarding the role of contextual factors 
      in behaviour management should be made available to carers.

TI  - An open-label pilot study of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to promote 
      functional recovery in elderly cognitively impaired stroke patients.
PG  - 317-21
LID - 10.1159/000149580 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Impairments in cognition and motivation are common after stroke and 
      predict poor functional recovery. Pharmacological agents that enhance cognition 
      and/or diminish apathy may, when combined with traditional rehabilitative 
      efforts, improve functional recovery. We investigated the feasibility of using 
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in older patients with acute post-stroke 
      cognitive impairment and examined their effects on functional recovery. METHODS: 
      This 12-week open-label study prospectively treated ischemic stroke survivors 
      aged > or =60 years who were undergoing inpatient rehabilitation and who had 
      cognitive impairment in one or more domains (memory, attention or executive 
      function). Participants received galantamine (maximum dose 24 mg/day) or 
      donepezil (maximum dose 10 mg/day). Physical function was assessed using the 
      Functional Independence Measure-motor subscale (FIM-motor); participants' 
      functional gains were compared to those of a matched historical comparator group. 
      Changes in cognition and apathy were also assessed. Since donepezil and 
      galantamine have different pharmacologic profiles, they were examined separately. 
      RESULTS: Forty participants started study medication; 14 participants terminated 
      prematurely. Donepezil-treated participants experienced a 14-point greater 
      improvement in the FIM-motor score compared to either galantamine-treated 
      participants or the historical comparator group (repeated measures mixed model, 
      group x time interaction p < 0.0001). Change in apathy, but not in cognition, was 
      also associated with change in the FIM-motor score. CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      open-label study, participants receiving donepezil had better functional recovery 
      than participants receiving galantamine or the historical comparators. This 
      improvement may reflect efficacy at the starting dose for donepezil but not 
      galantamine. A randomized trial is in progress.

TI  - [Dementia Care Mapping-Japanese version(DCM-J) as a research evaluation method 
      for measuring quality of life among elderly patients with dementia: reliability 
      and validity of Well-being and Ill-being value].
PG  - 68-76
AB  - AIM: Dementia Care Mapping is a behavior evaluation tool that can be used to 
      measure and improve the quality of life of elderly patients with dementia. 
      However, the reliability and validity of the Dementia Care Mapping-Japanese 
      version (DCM-J) has not yet been established. Therefore, the purpose of this 
      research was to clarify the reliability and validity of the Well-being and 
      Ill-being (WIB) value of the DCM-J as a method for evaluating quality of life. 
      METHODS: The study was conducted from April 1, 2005 to June 30, 2006. The 
      participants included 130 elderly patients (men 31, women 99, average age 
      82.65+/-7.69 years) who were given a diagnosis of dementia. We established 
      inter-rater reliability during a parallel observation method and also used 
      test-retest for reliability. The correlation between the WIB value of the DCM-J 
      and the Japanese Quality of Life Inventory for Elderly with Dementia (QOL-D) was 
      used to establish criterion-related validity. RESULTS: Forty-nine (37.7%) 
      subjects were given a diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer's type, 80 (61.5%) had 
      vascular dementia and 1 (0.8%) had dementia with Lewy bodies. The results showed 
      correlation between the WIB value and social withdrawal measured by the 
      behavioral category code (BCC) on the DCM-J and the three subscales of QOL-D: 
      "interacting with surroundings", "expressing self", and "experiencing minimum 
      negative behaviors". There was good internal consistency among these items. The 
      interclass correlation coefficient was 82.32 (+/-5.85) for the WIB value of the 
      DCM-J. The correlation coefficient of the retest, administered one week later, 
      was 0.836 (p=0.001). The WIB value was significantly correlated with three 
      sub-scales of QOL-D, and the correlation coefficient was greater than 0.53. 
      CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the WIB value of the DCM-J has good inter-rater 
      reliability and test re-test reliability and criterion-related validity. In this 
      study, the WIB value was shown to have similar reliability to the WIB value of 
      the original DCM. Furthermore, our results suggest that the DCM-J could be useful 
      for evaluating quality of life among elderly Japanese patients with dementia.

TI  - Beyond the "C" in MCI: noncognitive symptoms in amnestic and non-amnestic mild 
      cognitive impairment.
PG  - 66-72
AB  - INTRODUCTION: How frequent and how clinically important are mood and behavioral 
      symptoms among older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)? Although these 
      noncognitive behavioral symptoms (NCBS) are not represented in the diagnostic 
      criteria for MCI, their clinical significance is increasingly recognized. 
      METHODS: To address this question, the authors identified a cohort of 
      consecutively evaluated patients from a psychiatric hospital's outpatient memory 
      clinic. These patients' records contained both a clinical assessment and a 
      standardized set of evaluations including the Mini-Mental State Exam, the 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Using a 
      standardized chart-review approach, the presence of any NPI-screened symptom was 
      identified and the frequencies of specific NPI-screened symptoms were calculated 
      for the Memory Clinic MCI cohort and for amnestic and non-amnestic MCI subgroups. 
      RESULTS: A total of 116 patient records were reviewed. Thirty-eight patients with 
      MCI were identified. Twenty-two of these met criteria for amnestic MCI by Mayo 
      Clinic criteria while 16 met criteria for non-amnestic MCI. At least one 
      NPI-screened mood or behavioral symptom was present in 86.8% of these MCI 
      patients. Depression/dysphoria (63.3%), apathy (60.5%), anxiety (47.4%), 
      irritability (44.7%), and nighttime behaviors (42.1%) were the most frequent. 
      While depression/dysphoria was distributed similarly between amnestic and 
      non-amnestic subgroups, apathy was significantly more frequently associated with 
      the amnestic subtype of MCI, and nighttime behaviors were more frequently 
      associated with the non-amnestic subtype. CONCLUSION: Although the presence of 
      NCBS is not required for a diagnosis of MCI, these symptoms are frequently 
      present and constitute an important source of morbidity. Apathy and depression 
      may be difficult to differentiate, but targeted treatment of depression may fail 
      to address apathy. Recognizing the limitations of this preliminary study, the 
      authors suggest that apathy may be more characteristic of amnestic MCI while 
      nighttime behaviors may be more characteristic of non-amnestic MCI.

TI  - Relationship between measures of dementia severity and observation of daily life 
      functioning as measured with the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS).
PG  - 81-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is mostly regarded as the core symptom of 
      dementia, but several other domains (such as daily functioning) are equally 
      relevant to assess the severity of dementia. The relationship between these 
      domains is unclear. The Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS) is a 
      relatively unexplored instrument in people with dementia, measuring severity by 
      direct observation. OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between the AMPS and 
      scores on several commonly used outcome measures for the assessment of dementia 
      severity, and to examine the possible influence of neuropsychiatric symptoms on 
      these relationships in patients with cognitive disorders. METHODS: 
      Cross-sectional data of 118 patients with cognitive disorders were used; data on 
      cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE; CAMCOG), global severity (Global 
      Deterioration Scale, GDS), daily life functioning (Instrumental Activities of 
      Daily Living, IADL), and neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, 
      NPI) were collected and analyzed using correlation and regression analyses. 
      Different combinations of the severity measures were tested for their ability to 
      predict the AMPS process ability scores. RESULTS: Scores on the MMSE, CAMCOG and 
      GDS were moderately associated with the AMPS process ability score. These 
      measures explained between 27 and 44% of the variance in the AMPS score. The 
      presence of apathy influenced the association between the cognitive measures and 
      the AMPS score. CONCLUSION: Commonly used measures of dementia severity are only 
      moderately associated with observation of performance on daily activities. This 
      underlines the need for direct observation of daily activities in dementia 
      patients. This relationship between several approaches of assessing dementia 
      severity needs further study.

PG  - 183-6
AB  - We examined the validity of the motivation/initiative item of the Unified 
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) section I as a screening and diagnostic 
      measure for apathy in Parkinson's disease (PD). Fifty-eight patients with PD were 
      evaluated with the UPDRS, the 14-item Apathy Scale (AS), and standardized rating 
      scales of depression and cognitive impairment. Apathy was diagnosed using 
      specific items of the AS together with proposed criteria for apathy. A score of 2 
      or more on the motivation/initiative item was adequate to screen for apathy, 
      whereas a score of 4 had high diagnostic accuracy at the cost of unacceptable low 
      sensitivity.

TI  - Two dimensions of anosognosia in patients with Alzheimer's disease: reliability 
      and validity of the Japanese version of the Anosognosia Questionnaire for 
      Dementia (AQ-D).
PG  - 672-7
AB  - Although a number of studies have examined anosognosia of cognitive deficits in 
      patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), not much is known about the anosognosia 
      of behavioral symptoms in AD. The aims of the present study were to establish a 
      Japanese version of the Anosognosia Questionnaire-Dementia (AQ-D) and to examine 
      its factor structure, reliability and validity, and to identify the effects of 
      various variables on the AQ-D. Factor structure, internal consistency, 
      test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of the Japanese version of the 
      AQ-D were analyzed. Multiple regression was then done using the results of the 
      AQ-D as dependent variables and entering all relevant predictor variables. Both 
      the internal consistency and the test-retest reliability of the AQ-D were 
      excellent. Factor analysis indicated four factors: anosognosia of basic and 
      instrumental activities of daily living; that of episodic memory and orientation; 
      that of disinhibited behaviors; and that of apathy and depression. The first two 
      factors were regarded as anosognosia of cognitive deficits and were associated 
      with Mini-Mental State Examination scores, while the latter two factors were 
      regarded as anosognosia of behavioral symptoms and were associated with the 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score. A dissociation between the two domains of 
      anosognosia was confirmed, namely of cognitive deficits and of behavioral 
      symptoms using the Japanese version of the AQ-D. The knowledge that various 
      factors may have different effects on different domains of anosognosia in 
      patients with AD may serve as useful information for clinicians assessing 
      anosognosia in AD.

TI  - Geriatric Pain Measure short form: development and initial evaluation.
PG  - 2045-50
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate a short form of the 24-item Geriatric Pain 
      Measure (GPM) for use in community-dwelling older adults. DESIGN: Derivation and 
      validation of a 12-item version of the GPM in a European and an independent U.S. 
      sample of community-dwelling older adults. SETTING: Three community-dwelling 
      sites in London, United Kingdom; Hamburg, Germany; Solothurn, Switzerland; and 
      two ambulatory geriatrics clinics in Los Angeles, California. PARTICIPANTS: 
      European sample: 1,059 community-dwelling older persons from three sites (London, 
      UK; Hamburg, Germany; Solothurn, Switzerland); validation sample: 50 persons from 
      Los Angeles, California, ambulatory geriatric clinics. MEASUREMENTS: 
      Multidimensional questionnaire including self-reported demographic and clinical 
      information. RESULTS: Based on item-to-total scale correlations in the European 
      sample, 11 of 24 GPM items were selected for inclusion in the short form. One 
      additional item (pain-related sleep problems) was included based on clinical 
      relevance. In the validation sample, the Cronbach alpha of GPM-12 was 0.92 
      (individual subscale range 0.77-0.92), and the Pearson correlation coefficient 
      (r) between GPM-12 and the original GPM was 0.98. The correlation between the 
      GPM-12 and the McGill Pain Questionnaire was 0.63 (P<.001), similar to the 
      correlation between the original GPM and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (Pearson 
      r=0.63; P<.001). Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the GPM-12 covers 
      three subfactors (pain intensity, pain with ambulation, disengagement because of 
      pain). CONCLUSION: The GPM-12 demonstrated good validity and reliability in these 
      European and U.S. populations of older adults. Despite its brevity, the GPM-12 
      captures the multidimensional nature of pain in three subscales. The 
      self-administered GPM-12 may be useful in the clinical assessment process and 
      management of pain and in pain-related research in older persons.

TI  - A neuropsychological longitudinal study in Parkinson's patients with and without 
      hallucinations.
PG  - 2418-25
AB  - The aim of this work was to determine the progression of cognitive impairment in 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with or without hallucinations. Two years after 
      the first assessment, 36 PD patients were re-evaluated on standardized 
      neuropsychological tests, including the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and on 
      rating scales for overall cognitive functioning, functional autonomy, behavioral 
      disorders. Nine patients had hallucinations at baseline and endpoint assessments; 
      12 patients developed hallucinations during the follow-up; and 15 patients were 
      hallucination-free throughout the study. Cognitive performance significantly 
      declined in all three groups, but at endpoint assessment PD hallucinators scored 
      significantly lower than nonhallucinators on phonological and semantic fluency 
      tasks, immediate free recall and the go/no-go FAB subtest; moreover, they showed 
      more severe apathy than nonhallucinators. Reduced phonological fluency at 
      baseline (odds ratio [OR], 13.5; 95% CI: 1.34-135.98, P = 0.027) was the only 
      independent predictor of onset of hallucinations after 2 years, whereas 
      hallucinations (OR, 10.1; 95% CI: 1.94-51.54, P = 0.006) and poor phonological 
      fluency (OR, 6.1; 95% CI: 1.04-35.03, P = 0.045) independently predicted 
      development of diffuse cognitive impairment. We concluded that reduced verbal 
      fluency scores may predict the onset of hallucinations, while hallucinations and 
      poor phonological fluency may predict development of dementia in PD patients.

TI  - The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale: validation study of the mentation, 
      behavior, and mood section.
PG  - 2156-61
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the validity of the mentation, 
      behavior, and mood items included in Part I of the Unified Parkinson's Disease 
      Rating Scale (UPDRS) and to assess its usefulness to screen for dementia, 
      psychosis, depression, and apathy. A consecutive series of 168 patients with PD 
      were assessed by neurologists with the UPDRS, and by psychiatrists using a 
      comprehensive neuropsychiatric evaluation blind to each other's ratings. ROC 
      analysis demonstrated that a score of 2 or greater on the intellectual impairment 
      item of the UPDRS had 60% sensitivity and 92% specificity to detect dementia, as 
      diagnosed with DSM-IV criteria. When a score of 23 or lower on the MMSE was 
      included as an additional classification variable, the sensitivity increased to 
      85%. A score of 2 or greater on the thought disorder item had 43% sensitivity and 
      92% specificity to detect psychotic symptoms (delusions or hallucinations). A 
      score of 2 or greater on the depression item had 77% sensitivity and 82% 
      specificity to detect major depression as diagnosed with DSM-IV criteria. 
      Finally, a score of 2 or greater on the motivation/initiative item had 73% 
      sensitivity and 65% specificity to detect apathy, as diagnosed with a 
      standardized criteria. When the sample was divided into mild (i.e. Hohen-Yahr 
      stages I and II) versus moderate-severe PD (i.e. Hohen-Yahr stages III-V), 
      findings remained unchanged, except that the UPDRS show unacceptably low accuracy 
      to detect psychosis in mild PD. The mentation, behavior, and mood section of the 
      UPDRS is an adequate screen for depression and apathy, and has adequate 
      sensitivity to detect dementia when combined with the Mini-Mental State Exam, but 
      has low sensitivity to detect psychosis.

TI  - Gender differences in the symptoms of major depressive disorder.
PG  - 905-11
AB  - Data from the Canadian Community Health Survey 1.2 were used for a gender 
      analysis of individual symptoms and overall rates of depression in the preceding 
      12 months. Major depressive disorder was assessed using the Composite 
      International Diagnostic Interview in this national, cross-sectional survey. The 
      female to male ratio of major depressive disorder prevalence was 1.64:1, with n = 
      1766 having experienced depression (men 668, women 1098). Women reported 
      statistically more depressive symptoms than men (p < 0.001). Depressed women were 
      more likely to report "increased appetite" (15.5% vs. 10.7%), being "often in 
      tears" (82.6% vs. 44.0%), "loss of interest" (86.9% vs. 81.1%), and "thoughts of 
      death" (70.3% vs. 63.4%). No significant gender differences were found for the 
      remaining symptoms. The data are interpreted against women's greater tendency to 
      cry and to restrict food intake when not depressed. The question is raised 
      whether these items preferentially bias assessment of gender differences in 
      depression, particularly in nonclinic samples.

TI  - Recognizing apathy in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 14-7
AB  - Apathy has been increasingly recognized as a neuropsychiatric symptom in many 
      neurologic disorders. In this paper, we review the clinical features of apathy in 
      Alzheimer's disease. We also review screening, the differential diagnosis 
      including depression, medical illnesses, and mild cognitive impairment, and 
      treating modalities and issues. It must also be recognized that apathy per se 
      almost never occurs as an isolated syndrome, so it must be viewed in the context 
      of an individual's entire behavioral and cognitive status.

TI  - Quality of life in dementia: care recipient and caregiver perceptions of quality 
      of life in dementia: the LASER-AD study.
PG  - 1031-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality of Life (QoL) is a key outcome in dementia. AIM: To compare 
      care recipients' (CR) and caregivers' (CG) views on CRs' QoL and identify 
      determinants. METHODS: CRs and CGs completed the Quality of Life - Alzheimer's 
      Disease (QOL-AD) scale. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-one CR/CG dyads were 
      interviewed. There were differences between determinants of the CRs and CGs views 
      about QoL. Family-CGs rated CRs' QoL higher when CRs had fewer depressive 
      symptoms, less irritability, less apathy, less daily living impairment and lived 
      at home. Fewer depressive symptoms, living at home and taking 
      acetylcholinesterase-inhibitors (AChEI) predicted higher CR rated QoL. 
      CONCLUSION: Proxy ratings in dementia do not replicate CRs' views of QoL. This is 
      the first study to employ a validated QoL measure for people with dementia taking 
      AChEIs. Randomised controlled trials are needed before drawing conclusions about 
      their effect on QoL. Interpretation of correlations between QoL and symptoms 
      should be cautious as QoL is designed to reflect the impact of psychological and 
      physical symptoms.

TI  - Reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the Dysexecutive 
      Questionnaire (DEX) in Alzheimer's disease: validation of a behavioral rating 
      scale to assess dysexecutive symptoms in Japanese patients with Alzheimer's 
      disease.
PG  - 951-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both executive cognitive dysfunction and behavioral problems 
      contribute to dysexecutive symptoms in daily life. The aim of the present study 
      was to develop a behavior rating scale for assessing dysexecutive symptoms in 
      Japanese patients with AD. METHOD: The Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX), devised 
      by Burgess et al. (1998), was used to evaluate 122 Japanese patients with AD. The 
      factor structure, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct 
      validity of the Japanese version of the DEX were then examined. RESULTS: The 
      Japanese version of the DEX demonstrated a good internal reliability and a good 
      test-retest reliability. Factor analysis revealed three factors that were named 
      'apathy', 'hyperactivity' and 'planning and monitoring process of the purposive 
      action'. The 'apathy' factor of the DEX was significantly correlated with the 
      'apathy' score of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), while 'planning and 
      monitoring process' factor of the DEX was significantly correlated with the total 
      score of the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and the 'hyperactivity' factor of 
      the DEX was significantly correlated with the 'aggression', 'euphoria' and 
      'disinhibition' scores of the NPI. CONCLUSIONS: The Japanese DEX is a reliable 
      and valid instrument for assessing executive dysfunction conveniently in real 
      life situations of AD patients. While two factors, 'apathy' and 'hyperactivity', 
      were associated with emotional and behavioral changes, the 'planning and 
      monitoring process' was associated with the cognitive executive function in the 
      patients with AD. These findings suggest that both a neuropsychiatric syndrome 
      and cognitive function contribute to the dysexecutive symptoms experienced by AD 
      patients in daily life.

TI  - Withdrawal, apathy and lack of vigor in late life depression: factorial validity 
      and relationship to diagnosis.
PG  - 532-7
AB  - Withdrawal, apathy and lack of vigor (WAV) describe a pattern of lack of vitality 
      and dropping of interests and activities in later life, which may or may not 
      indicate depression. This study examines (a) whether the Geriatric Depression 
      Scale (GDS) contains a measure of this symptom cluster, and if so, (b) whether 
      the presence of WAV leads to more false positive predictions by the GDS. A total 
      of 444 Chinese older persons responded to the GDS and the Mini-Mental State 
      Examination (MMSE), and were independently assessed by psychiatrists for 
      depression and other diagnoses. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that six WAV 
      symptoms formed a distinct cluster on the GDS. WAV was positively correlated with 
      age and MMSE but most other symptom clusters measured on the GDS were not. 
      Nonetheless, the ROC curves were essentially the same, regardless of whether the 
      WAV items were included or not. Further analysis revealed that the optimal cutoff 
      for the GDS without WAV produced fewer false positives, but also missed more true 
      cases, than the full scale. The extent to which false positives become an issue 
      depends on the specific threshold chosen (which entails a tradeoff with 
      sensitivity) rather than the presence of WAV items.

TI  - Symptoms of dementia among adults with Down's syndrome: a qualitative study.
PG  - 726-39
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dementia is common among adults with Down's syndrome (DS); yet the 
      diagnosis of dementia, particularly in its early stage, can be difficult in this 
      population. One possible reason for this may be the different clinical 
      manifestation of dementia among people with intellectual disabilities. AIMS: The 
      aim of this study was to map out the carers' perspective of symptoms of dementia 
      among adults with DS in order to inform the development of an informant-rated 
      screening questionnaire. METHOD: Unconstrained information from carers of people 
      with DS and dementia regarding the symptoms, particularly the early symptoms of 
      dementia, was gathered using a qualitative methodology. Carers of 24 adults with 
      DS and dementia were interviewed. The interviews were recorded and fully 
      transcribed. The transcripts were then analysed using qualitative software. 
      RESULTS: There appeared to be many similarities in the clinical presentation of 
      dementia in adults with DS and the non-intellectually disabled general 
      population. Like in the non-intellectually disabled general population, 
      forgetfulness especially, impairment of recent memory combined with a relatively 
      intact distant memory and confusion were common, and presented early in dementia 
      among adults with DS. However, many 'frontal lobe'-related symptoms that are 
      usually manifested later in the process of dementia among the general population 
      were common at an early stage of dementia among adults with DS. A general 
      slowness including slowness in activities and speech, other language problems, 
      loss of interest in activities, social withdrawal, balance problems, sleep 
      problems, loss of pre-existing skills along with the emergence of emotional and 
      behaviour problems were common among adults with DS in our study. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study highlights the similarities in the clinical presentation of dementia 
      among the general population and people with DS with a particular emphasis on the 
      earlier appearance of symptoms associated with the frontal lobe dysfunction among 
      adults with DS.

TI  - Coping with recurrent breast cancer: predictors of distressing symptoms and 
      health-related quality of life.
PG  - 24-39
AB  - Little is known about how postmenopausal women with recurrent breast cancer cope 
      with distressing symptoms and which factors predict health-related quality of 
      life (HRQOL). In the present study, 56 consecutively enrolled patients completed 
      questionnaires measuring symptom occurrence, coping capacity, coping efforts, and 
      HRQOL at the time of recurrence. Results from this study illustrate that women 
      with recurrent breast cancer suffer from multiple, concurrent, and interrelated 
      symptoms of illness, anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Highly prevalent symptoms 
      are lack of energy, difficulty sleeping, pain, worrying, problems with sexual 
      interest, feeling sad, and dry mouth. The most frequently occurring symptom is 
      problem with sexual interest, and the most severe symptom is worrying. The most 
      distressing symptom experienced is pain. The majority of the women report 10-23 
      symptoms. Women who experience multiple symptoms also report higher levels of 
      symptom distress. The experience of distressing symptoms is predicted by coping 
      capacity, and the coping efforts experienced predict HRQOL. Patients with lower 
      coping capacity report higher prevalence of symptoms, experience higher levels of 
      distress, and experience worse perceived health, which in turn may decrease their 
      HRQOL. To help women manage recurrent breast cancer, it is important to use 
      multidimensional measurement to identify, evaluate, and treat distressing 
      symptoms, and not assess single symptoms only. Care must be based upon the 
      awareness of critical factors that exacerbate vulnerability to distress, as well 
      as the ability to adapt to a recurrent breast cancer disease.

TI  - Development of a short version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale specifically 
      adapted for demented nursing home residents.
PG  - 376-85
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Apathy is among the most frequent neuropsychiatric symptoms in 
      dementia, particularly Alzheimer disease. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) has 
      been widely employed for assessing apathy in different patient groups. To further 
      facilitate the usage of the AES, an abbreviated version was constructed. METHOD: 
      On basis of a sample of 356 nursing home residents, a cross-validation procedure 
      was carried out to develop a brief version of the AES. According to a thorough 
      clinical examination, 85% of the residents were demented, 8% presented with mild 
      cognitive impairment, whereas 7% did not present any cognitive deficits. After 
      subdividing the patient group into two matched samples, the first subsample was 
      used to identify problematic items due to defined psychometric and 
      content-related criteria. The original 18-item scale was thus reduced to 10 
      items. Psychometric properties of the shortened version were subsequently 
      reassessed in the second subsample. RESULTS: The short version demonstrated 
      favorable psychometric properties that could be confirmed by cross-validation 
      with the second sample. Correlations with the original full-length version were 
      high (r = 0.97 for both subsamples); the shortened scale yielded no substantial 
      losses regarding internal consistency or construct validity (correlations with 
      the respective subscales of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory). CONCLUSION: The 
      frequency of apathetic symptoms in the nursing home residents included confirms 
      the clinical importance of apathy for understanding dementia. Given this specific 
      patient population, setting, and mode of data collection, the short-version AES 
      seems to be a valuable and time-efficient instrument for assessing apathy.

TI  - Clinical and psychometric distinction of frontotemporal and Alzheimer dementias.
PG  - 535-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: A proportion of patients who meet the National Institute of 
      Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease 
      and Related Disorders Associations criteria for Alzheimer disease (AD) have 
      frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) confirmed at autopsy, with or without 
      concomitant AD. Thus, the clinical phenotypes of the 2 disorders may overlap. 
      OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical and psychometric indicators that distinguish AD 
      from FTLD at initial presentation. DESIGN: Longitudinal study of memory and 
      aging. SETTING: Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Washington University School 
      of Medicine. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight clinically well-characterized cases of 
      autopsy-confirmed FTLD (27 with psychometric testing results) were compared with 
      27 autopsy-confirmed AD cases. RESULTS: Behavioral abnormalities, particularly 
      impulsivity (P<.001), disinhibition (P<.001), social withdrawal (P = .01), and 
      progressive nonfluent aphasia, distinguished individuals with FTLD from those 
      with AD. The individuals with FTLD performed better than those with AD on a 
      visual test of episodic memory (P = .01), but worse on word fluency (P = .02) 
      (performance correlated with aphasic features). Other cognitive and clinical 
      features, including executive dysfunction and memory impairment, were comparable 
      between the FTLD and AD groups. Concomitant histopathological AD was present in 
      11 of the 48 individuals with FTLD. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and cognitive features 
      of FTLD may overlap with AD, although behavioral and language difficulties 
      distinguish those with FTLD. Memory loss in those with FTLD may in part reflect 
      word-finding difficulties stemming from language dysfunction. Compounding the 
      overlap of FTLD and AD clinical phenotypes is the presence of histopathological 
      AD in almost one fourth of individuals with FTLD.

TI  - Screening for depression among patients with multiple sclerosis: two questions 
      may be enough.
PG  - 215-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is common and 
      has a significant impact on quality of life. As many as two-thirds of depressed 
      MS patients receive no treatment for their depression. While guidelines for 
      depression management suggest screening, the only validated screening tools are 
      questionnaires, which have not been widely implemented in practice. This is the 
      first study on the effectiveness of using two questions assessing mood and 
      anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure) in screening for major depressive 
      disorder (MDD) in MS. METHODS: MS patients under the care of neurologists were 
      recruited from a large health maintenance organization (HMO). The MDD module of 
      the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV and screening questions was 
      administered. RESULTS: Of the 260 participants, 26% met the criteria for MDD. 
      Among patients with MDD, 67% received no anti-depressant medication. The MDD 
      screen identified 99% (95% CI: 91-100%) of cases. DISCUSSION: A brief, two 
      question screen is reliable in identifying MS patients with MDD. This suggests 
      that asking these two brief questions could identify almost all MS patients 
      meeting MDD criteria, with minimal numbers of false positives.

TI  - Premorbid personality and behavioral and psychological symptoms in probable 
      Alzheimer disease.
PG  - 202-13
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous research investigating the influence of premorbid 
      personality on behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD) has 
      produced mixed findings. Addressing some limitations of previous studies, the 
      authors aimed to investigate whether some of the common individual symptoms of 
      BPSD (depression, anxiety, irritability, and aggression) were associated with key 
      aspects of previous personality (neuroticism and agreeableness); and also to 
      perform an exploratory investigation into the broader influence of personality 
      factors on behavioral and psychological syndromes. METHODS: Two hundred eight 
      patients with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer disease were assessed for the 
      presence of BPSD over the disease course using the caregiver-rated 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). One or two knowledgeable informants rated 
      patients' midlife personalities using a retrospective version of the NEO-FFI 
      questionnaire. RESULTS: Premorbid neuroticism was correlated with anxiety and 
      total NPI score, although not with depression. Premorbid agreeableness was 
      negatively correlated with agitation and irritability. Principal components 
      analysis of the 10 NPI behavioral domains identified three syndromes: 
      "agitation/apathy," "psychosis," and "affect." In stepwise linear regression 
      analyses, including personality domains from the Five-Factor Model and a range of 
      potential confounders as independent variables; the only significant personality 
      predictor of a behavioral syndrome was "agitation/apathy," predicted by lower 
      premorbid agreeableness. CONCLUSION: Lower premorbid agreeableness is associated 
      with agitation and irritability symptoms in Alzheimer disease and also predicts 
      an "agitation/apathy" syndrome. The relationship between premorbid neuroticism 
      and BPSD is less straightforward, and premorbid neuroticism does not appear to be 
      associated with depression in Alzheimer disease or predict an "affect" syndrome.

TI  - Clinically defined vascular depression in the general population.
PG  - 383-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular depression is regarded as a subtype of depression, 
      especially in, but not entirely restricted to, the elderly, characterized by a 
      specific clinical presentation and an association with (cerebro)vascular risk and 
      disease. It could have major implications for treatment if subjects at risk for 
      such a depression could be easily identified by their clinical presentation in 
      general practice. METHOD: We studied the symptom profile of depression in 
      subjects with and without vascular risk factors in two large Dutch 
      community-based studies, the Rotterdam Study and the Amsterdam Study of the 
      Elderly (AMSTEL). RESULTS: We could not confirm the specific symptom profile in 
      depressed subjects with vascular risk factors in either of the two cohorts. 
      Depressed subjects with vascular risk factors showed more loss of energy and more 
      physical disability than those without vascular risk factors. However, presumed 
      specific symptoms of vascular depression, namely psychomotor retardation and 
      anhedonia, were not significantly associated with any of the vascular risk 
      indicators. Loss of energy was significantly associated with myocardial 
      infarction and peripheral arterial disease. CONCLUSIONS: In these two large 
      community-based studies we identified some differences between vascular and 
      non-vascular depressed subjects but found no evidence for a specific symptom 
      profile of vascular depression as previously defined.

TI  - Socioeconomic differences in adolescent stress: the role of psychological 
      resources.
PG  - 127-34
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate whether psychological resources influenced the 
      association between parent education (PE), a marker of socioeconomic status 
      (SES), and perceived stress. METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses were conducted in 
      a sample of 1167 non-Hispanic black and white junior and senior high school 
      students from a Midwestern public school district in 2002-2003. Hierarchical 
      multivariable regression analyses examined relationships between PE (high school 
      graduate or less = E1, > high school, < college = E2, college graduate = E3, and 
      professional degree = E4), and psychological resources (optimism and coping 
      style) on teens' perceived stress. Greater optimism and adaptive coping were 
      hypothesized to influence (i.e., mediate or moderate) the relationship between 
      higher PE and lower stress. RESULTS: Relative to adolescents from families with a 
      professionally educated parent, adolescents with lower parent education had 
      higher perceived stress (E3 beta = 1.70, p < .01, E2 beta = 1.94, p < .01, E1 
      beta = 3.19, p < .0001). Both psychological resources were associated with 
      stress: higher optimism (beta = -.58, p < .0001) and engagement coping (beta = 
      -.19, p < .0001) were associated with less stress and higher disengagement coping 
      was associated with more stress (beta = .09, p < .01). Adding optimism to the 
      regression model attenuated the effect of SES by nearly 30%, suggesting that 
      optimism partially mediates the inverse SES-stress relationship. Mediation was 
      confirmed using a Sobel test (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents from families 
      with lower parent education are less optimistic than teens from more educated 
      families. This pessimism may be a mechanism through which lower SES increases 
      stress in adolescence.

TI  - Behavioral correlates of GABAergic disruption in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 151-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Losses of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) have been variably 
      demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may be related to the presence of 
      behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in AD. Our objective was 
      to assess the relationship between plasma GABA (pGABA) levels and specific BPSD 
      in patients with severe AD. METHODS: pGABA levels and BPSD were measured in 14 
      institutionalized AD patients (8M/6F, mean age +/- S.D. = 85.6 +/- 4.5 years) 
      with severe cognitive impairment (Mini-mental State Examination score = 4.5 +/- 
      4.6) and prominent behavioral disturbances (Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) 
      score = 33.4 +/- 23.6). RESULTS: pGABA was positively correlated with depression 
      and apathy scores on the NPI and negatively correlated with age. Apathy and age 
      were independent predictors of pGABA levels. CONCLUSIONS: The final stages of AD 
      are associated with GABAergic changes, which may contribute to depression and 
      apathy in AD.

TI  - An appraisal of the psychometric properties of the Clinician version of the 
      Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-C).
PG  - 97-110
AB  - This article examines the psychometric properties of the clinician version of the 
      Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-C) to determine its ability to characterize, 
      quantify and differentiate apathy. Critical appraisals of the item-reduction 
      processes, effectiveness of the administration, coding and scoring procedures, 
      and the reliability and validity of the scale were carried out. For training, 
      administration and rating of the AES-C, clearer guidelines, including a more 
      standardized list of verbal and non-verbal apathetic cues, are needed. There is 
      evidence of high internal consistency for the scale across studies. In addition, 
      the original study reported good test-retest and inter-rater reliability 
      coefficients. However, there is a lack of replication on these more stable and 
      informative measures of reliability and as such they warrant further 
      investigation. The research evidence confirms that the AES-C shows good 
      discriminant, convergent and criterion validity. However, evidence of its 
      predictive validity is limited. As this aspect of validity refers to the scale's 
      ability to predict future outcomes, which is important for treatment and 
      rehabilitation planning, further assessment of the predictive validity of the 
      AES-C is needed. In conclusion, the AES-C is a reliable and valid measure for the 
      characterization and quantification of apathy.

AB  - The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) scale is widely used for

      test the validity and reliability of the Swedish version in four populations, 
      with a total of 584 patients. The participants were classified into four groups: 
      palliative cancer patients, cancer patients receiving radiation therapy, 
      non-cancer outpatients, and a group of hospital staff. The MFI-20 consists of 
      five subscales of fatigue: General Fatigue (GF), Physical Fatigue (PF), Reduced 
      Motivation (RM), Reduced Activity (RA) and Mental Fatigue (MF). We have tested 
      the convergent validity of the MFI-20 using the Category Ratio instrument 
      (CR-10). The validity and the reliability of MFI-20 were acceptable. All 
      subscales of the MFI-20 were correlated, and all were also correlated with the 
      CR-10 score (p < or = 0.001). General Fatigue was highly correlated with Physical 
      Fatigue for the three patient groups, but this was not the fact for healthy 
      staff. Deleting some items increased Cronbach's alpha of the subscale to which 
      these items belonged (where alpha measures the reliability of the results). The 
      level of non-response was low (less than 1.2%) and there was no pattern to the 
      items omitted. We conclude that the MFI-20 is a valid and reliable instrument for 
      measuring fatigue in patients and in healthy individuals. The results support, to 
      some extent, earlier findings and one item can be removed from the Swedish 
      version of the MFI-20.

TI  - Validation therapy (VT) in nursing home: a case-control study.
PG  - 407-11
AB  - VT is a method for communicating with elderly people with dementia. It has been 
      applied since 2001 at the "Istituto Giovanni XXIII" in Bologna, a public trust, 
      housing over 500 not self-sufficient elderly people. Around 75% of these subjects 
      suffer from cognitive impairment, associated to behavioral and psychological 
      symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in over 35%. To assess the effectiveness of VT, we 
      carried out a study involving 50 subjects divided in two groups, of cases and 
      controls, made up by 27 and 23 patients, respectively. In both groups 
      neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) and the Bedford Alzheimer nursing severity scale 
      (BANSS) were used before the start and after the end of the study; the case group 
      underwent both individual and group VT. The results show a marked decrease of the 
      average NPI symptom score in the case group (from 22.0 to 9.5) vs. a rise in the 
      control group (from 21.7 to 24.1). Agitation, apathy, irritability and nighttime 
      behaviors were the most improved NPI items among the subjects who underwent the 
      VT. In these patients also the NPI distress score turned out reduced, vs. a small 
      increase in the control group. In the case group an improvement occurred with 
      BANSS too, even if much slighter changes were registered vs. the control group. 
      Although the small number of subjects enlisted does not allow to draw firm 
      inferences, the study suggests that VT is able to reduce the severity and 
      frequency of BPSD, thus improving the relationship with and the management of 
      patients having diagnosis of dementia without any side effects.

TI  - Apathy in dementia: an examination of the psychometric properties of the apathy 
      evaluation scale.
PG  - 57-64
AB  - The psychometric properties of the clinician, informant, and self-rated versions 
      of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-C/I/S) were examined using data on 121 
      outpatients seen in a behavioral neurology clinic for the assessment of dementia 
      and associated neuropsychiatric disorders. Two factors, apathy and interest, were 
      identified for the AES-C and the AES-I. The AES-S had only an apathy factor. The 
      AES-C was found to have fairly good psychometric properties. However, from a 
      diagnostic point of view, the AES-I provided the greatest sensitivity and the 
      strongest positive and negative predictive values. Generally, the AES-S performed 
      poorly compared with the AES-C and AES-I.

TI  - Short-term stability of diagnoses of major and minor depression in older medical 
      inpatients.
PG  - 38-45
AB  - The authors sought to determine the short-term stability of diagnoses of major 
      and minor depression in older medical inpatients. The investigation was a 
      test-retest design involving comparisons between different pairs of interviewers 
      who assessed patients independently on medical wards of two acute-care, 
      university-affiliated hospitals by use of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) 
      at intervals between 1 and 51 days. Patients were 380 cognitively-intact patients 
      age > or =65, assessed twice with the DIS. Core depressive symptoms (depressed 
      mood, loss of interest or pleasure) were more stable than the other depressive 
      symptoms. The presence of moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms, 
      moderate-to-severe disability, and depression symptoms of > or =6 months' 
      duration were associated with a higher short-term stability of diagnosis. Age, 
      gender, language, education, rater, interval between assessments, baseline number 
      of medications, medical comorbidity, severity of medical illness, acute 
      physiology score, and cognitive functioning were not associated with short-term 
      depression stability. Stability of diagnosis may be improved by emphasis on core 
      depressive symptoms or the presence of more severe depressive symptoms, 
      moderate-to-severe disability, and duration of symptoms > or =6 months.

TI  - [Psychometric properties of a German version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale].
PG  - 714-22
AB  - Apathy is a common feature of a variety of different psychiatric, neurological, 
      and medical disorders. It can be defined as lack of motivation affecting 
      cognitive, emotional, and overt behavioural aspects. Despite being associated 
      with other clinical disorders, apathy can also occur as an independent syndrome 
      (e. g., after brain injuries), now depicting a primary loss of motivation. 
      However, apathy is predominantly assessed within the scope of superordinate 
      psychiatric disorders. As a syndrome-independent scale, the Apathy Evaluation 
      Scale (AES) claims to assess levels of apathy in different disorders. The aim of 
      the present study is to provide German speaking researchers with an authorized 
      German translation of the AES (AES (D)). The scale was evaluated in a sample of 
      217 subjects, consisting of patients suffering from dementia (n=120), 
      remission-phase schizophrenia (n=20), Parkinson's disease (n=12), stroke (n=28), 
      as well as elderly healthy controls (n=37). Preliminary results concerning the 
      factorial structure, item characteristics, reliability, and construct validity 
      demonstrate favourable statistical properties and suggest that the AESD is 
      comparable to its original. The scale seems well-suited to detect apathy in 
      different clinical groups. Differences between informant sources (clinician 
      interview, self-, and informant ratings) seem to be related to the severity of 
      symptoms or expert practice.

TI  - Impact of androgen deprivation therapy on physical and cognitive function, as 
      well as quality of life of patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer.
PG  - 2443-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Many patients with prostate cancer receive androgen deprivation therapy 
      for long periods. We compared physical and cognitive function, and quality of 
      life in a cross-sectional study of 57 patients receiving androgen deprivation 
      therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer and 51 healthy age matched controls. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Physical and daily function were measured by the 6-minute 
      walk test, grip strength, the timed up and go test, and activities of daily 
      living measures. Cognitive function was evaluated by the High Sensitivity 
      Cognitive Screen and by a self-report prototype Functional Assessment of Cancer 
      Therapy cognitive function subscale. Quality of life was assessed by the 
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General with the subscale for fatigue and 
      by the Patient-Oriented Prostate Utility Scale. RESULTS: Androgen deprivation 
      therapy was given for a median of 1.8 years (range 0.4 to 7.4). Patients had 
      lower median hemoglobin than controls (134 vs 148 gm/l, p <0.0001). Performance 
      on physical tests was similar in the 2 groups. Moderate or severe cognitive 
      impairment by the High Sensitivity Cognitive Screen was similar for patients 
      (23%) and controls (35%, p = 0.2). Self-reported cognitive dysfunction was also 
      similar. Scores for the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General were 
      similar but the Patient Oriented Prostate Utility Scale summary score was worse 
      for patients (median 71 vs 86, p <0.001). More patients reported severe fatigue 
      (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue score less than 35, p = 0.03). 
      Low energy, poor bladder control and loss of sexual function were reported in 
      36%, 47% and 95% of patients, and in 16%, 34% and 33% of controls, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy experience more 
      symptoms and have worse fatigue than controls, but this study did not detect any 
      effect on physical or cognitive function.

TI  - Promoting enhanced patient and family caregiver congruence on lung cancer symptom 
      experiences.
PG  - 273-82
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To test the effects of different perspective-taking 
      instructional sets, gender, caregivers' personal histories with cancer, and 
      caregiving relationship factors on family caregiver and patient perceptual 
      agreement of symptom experiences of patients with lung cancer. DESIGN: 
      Counterbalanced. SETTING: Thoracic oncology outpatient clinical setting in 
      Canada. SAMPLE: 98 dyads consisting of patients with lung cancer and their family 
      caregivers. METHODS: Data were collected on a one-time basis by employing an 
      abbreviated version of the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale targeting lack of 
      energy and worrying. Caregivers were randomized to one of six counterbalanced 
      conditions of perspective-taking instructions. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Caregiver 
      discrepancy scores, instructional sets (i.e., neutral, self-report, and 
      imagine-self and imagine-patient perspective-taking), order effects, gender, 
      caregivers' personal history with cancer, and caregiving relationship factors. 
      FINDINGS: No order effects were found for the instructional sets. Instructions to 
      imagine the patient's perspective over imagining how the caregiver would feel if 
      he or she had cancer were most effective in enhancing the caregiver's ability to 
      estimate the patient's lack of energy and worrying. Gender had no significant 
      effects. The amount of patient-caregiver communication had a positive impact on 
      the accuracy of caregivers' perspectives. CONCLUSIONS: The patient-oriented 
      instructions had a limited impact on enhancing patient-caregiver congruence on 
      patient symptoms. This likely is related to the study's convenience sample of 
      caregivers who appear to naturally engage in empathic processes of 
      patient-oriented perspective-taking when they assessed and reported on patient 
      symptom conditions. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Further exploratory work should 
      identify interpersonal conditions that negatively hamper the effects of caregiver 
      perspective-taking on their reasonable understanding of patient symptoms.

TI  - Depression in acute stroke.
PG  - 377-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Depression is one of the most frequent neuropsychiatric disturbances 
      in stroke patients. The clinical aspects and correlations of depression in the 
      first days after acute stroke are less known. This study aimed to 1) assess the 
      frequency of depression, 2) describe the profile of depression of stroke patients 
      and 3) analyze the relation between depression and demographic, predisposing and 
      precipitating conditions, and clinical and imaging data, in acute stroke 
      patients. METHODS: We used the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale to 
      assess depression in 178 consecutive acute (<or= 4 days) stroke (26 subarachnoid 
      hemorrhage, 31 intracerebral hemorrhage, 121 cerebral infarct) patients (mean age 
      57 yr) and in a control group of 50 acute coronary patients (mean age 59 yr). 
      RESULTS: Eighty-two patients (46%) presented acute depression; apathy/loss of 
      interest was the most frequent clinical feature. In logistic regression, the best 
      model to predict depression (backward model) identified previous mood disorder 
      (odds ratio 2.2-12.9) as an independent predictor. There were no significant 
      differences in the frequency or severity (p > 0.45) of depression between control 
      subjects and acute stroke patients. CONCLUSIONS: Depression was present in almost 
      one-half of the acute stroke patients and was related to previous mood disorder 
      but not not to stroke type or location. Apathy/loss of interest was the 
      predominant clinical feature.

TI  - ADCS Prevention Instrument Project: behavioral measures in primary prevention 
      trials.
PG  - S147-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for the development of inexpensive, reliable, 
      and valid instruments that can be used in large-scale primary prevention trials 
      of compounds aimed at ameliorating progression from normal aging to mild 
      cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease. The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative 
      Study launched a Prevention Instrument Project to develop such methodologies. 
      Behavioral changes are common in diseases causing dementia and may occur prior to 
      a point when cognitive changes are sufficiently severe to allow diagnosis of a 
      dementia syndrome. Experimental behavioral measures were included in the protocol 
      to examine this hypothesis. METHODS: Six hundred forty-four individuals with CDR 
      0 or 0.5 were randomly assigned to receive a brief in-clinic behavioral 
      assessment or telephonic administration of the same assessment. The questions 
      were asked to the individual and their research partner. The Prevention 
      Instrument Project included behavioral measures of depression, anxiety, 
      irritability, and apathy. RESULTS: All measures demonstrated acceptable 
      test-retest reliability at 3-month intervals except for the single-item 
      depression screen by the subjects' research partner. Behavioral changes are 
      significantly more common among patients with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 
      scores of 0.5 compared with CDR scores of 0. Behavioral alterations including 
      irritability, anxiety, and apathy are more common among ethnic minorities than 
      among the White population. Depression, irritability, anxiety, and apathy are 
      significantly correlated with each other. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral changes are 
      common among those with mild degrees of cognitive compromise (CDR 0.5). 
      Telephonic assessment of behavioral changes is feasible. The predictive value of 
      these alterations for progression to Alzheimer disease or other dementias will be 
      assessed longitudinally.

TI  - Improvement in the health-related quality-of-life symptoms of hyperparathyroidism 
      is durable on long-term follow-up.
PG  - 655-63; discussion 653-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subjective symptoms such as decreased energy, chronic fatigue, and 
      depression are associated with hyperparathyroidism. Studies have shown that these 
      symptoms are improved during short-term follow-up after parathyroidectomy. This 
      study evaluates the durability of this subjective improvement in quality-of-life 
      symptoms in a large population of patients with follow-up greater than 1 year 
      after operation. METHODS: Between 2002 and 2005, 258 patients underwent 
      parathyroidectomy, 100 (81 females and 19 males) of whom were available for this 
      study. The patients were evaluated with a survey based on the Health Outcomes 
      Institute Health Status Questionnaire. Some answers were quantified on a 1 to 6 
      scale, while others consisted of "yes" or "no" responses. Patients completed a 
      questionnaire prior to parathyroidectomy and postoperatively at 1 month, 3 to 6 
      months, and 1 to 2 years or greater intervals. Statistical analysis was used to 
      detect changes attributable to parathyroidectomy. A P value <.05 was considered 
      statistically significant. RESULTS: At 1-month follow-up, patients' perceptions 
      of their overall health, energy level, and mood significantly improved. At 
      6-month follow-up, significant improvements in muscle strength, health, 
      endurance, and relief of anxiety were documented. At the interval of 1 to 2 
      years, overall health, energy level, endurance, and relief of anxiety were 
      improved. There was no significant decrement in the quality of life in these 
      patients after parathyroidectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Parathyroidectomy for 
      hyperparathyroidism is associated with significant lasting improvement in 
      subjective symptoms. The potential durable improvement in these quality-of-life 
      symptoms is a valid indication for parathyroidectomy.

TI  - Quality of life is decreased after treatment for nonfunctioning pituitary 
      macroadenoma.
PG  - 3364-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although a reduced quality of life (QoL) has been reported after 
      long-term cure of functioning pituitary adenomas, the effect of successful 
      treatment of nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenoma (NFMA) on QoL has not been 
      fully addressed. Therefore, we evaluated a broad spectrum of QoL parameters in 
      patients successfully treated for NFMA in our center. DESIGN: We conducted a 
      case-control study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed QoL in 99 adult patients 
      (mean age, 61.9 yr; range, 24-86 yr) in remission during long-term follow-up 
      after surgical (n = 99) and additional radiotherapeutic (n = 37) treatment for 
      NFMA by four validated health-related questionnaires (Hospital Anxiety and 
      Depression Scale, Multidimensional Fatigue Index, Nottingham Health Profile, and 
      Short Form-36). Patient outcomes were compared with 125 controls and with 
      age-adjusted reference values derived from the literature. RESULTS: NFMA patients 
      reported significantly impaired QoL in all questionnaires compared with the 125 
      controls and the age-adjusted reference values. All subscales of fatigue, 
      assessed using the Multidimensional Fatigue Index (general fatigue, physical 
      fatigue, reduction in activity, reduction in motivation, and mental fatigue) were 
      impaired. The scores in the Nottingham Health Profile pointed toward reduced 
      energy and affected emotional reaction. In several subscales of the Short Form-36 
      (social functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, role limitations 
      due to emotional problems, and general health perception), NFMA patients reported 
      a reduced QoL. CONCLUSION: QoL is considerably reduced in patients after 
      successful treatment of NFMA.

TI  - [Screening colonoscopy among first degree relatives of patients with colorectal 
      carcinoma].
PG  - 997-1001
AB  - BACKGROUND: First degree relatives of patients with colorectal carcinoma are at a 
      higher risk of having the disease than the general population. Therefore, they 
      should be subjected to screening colonoscopy. AIM: To assess the effectiveness of 
      colonoscopy among first degree relatives of patients with colorectal carcinoma. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: A free colonoscopy was offered to first degree relatives of 
      patients operated on for colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2000. As inclusion 
      criteria, subjects had to be asymptomatic, older than 40 years or less than 10 
      years younger than the index case. Each subject was contacted twice, inviting 
      him/her to have a colonoscopy performed. RESULTS: Two hundred forty three 
      relatives were contacted for the study and in 76, a colonoscopy was performed. 
      Among the latter, a neoplasm was found in 13 (17%): One adenocarcinoma and 12 
      adenomas. Three of these lesions were located in the right colon. The main reason 
      given by the 176 subjects that did not agree to have a colonoscopy was lack of 
      interest. CONCLUSIONS: Screening colonoscopy is effective to detect adenoma and 
      adenocarcinoma among first degree relatives of patients with colorectal 
      carcinoma, however only 31% of all potential relatives agreed to undergo a 
      colonoscopy.

TI  - Correlation between the Overactive Bladder questionnaire (OAB-q) and urodynamic 
      data of Parkinson disease patients affected by neurogenic detrusor overactivity 
      during antimuscarinic treatment.
PG  - 220-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Parkinson disease (PD) patients present urinary symptoms during the 
      course of the disease, very often suggestive of overactive bladder and sustained 
      by neurogenic detrusor overactivity. These symptoms cause a severe lowering of 
      quality of life determining social withdrawal and they need to be early diagnosed 
      to restore social interaction and prevent urinary tract complications. Today 
      overactive bladder diagnosis is easier, thanks to the availability of new 
      investigative tools, particularly voiding questionnaires. The aim of the present 
      study was to evaluate the reliability of the Overactive Bladder screener (OAB 
      screener/OAB-questionnaire), a new voiding questionnaire specifically developed 
      for the overactive bladder diagnosis in PD subjects suffering from overactive 
      bladder symptoms. Clinical data obtained by the questionnaire were compared with 
      urodynamic outcomes, at basal conditions and after antimuscarinic treatment, to 
      better explorate the questionnaire reliability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty PD 
      patients have been enrolled in the protocol, and submitted to the OAB screener, 
      voiding diary and urodynamic investigation before and after antimuscarinic 
      treatment. OAB-score and urodynamic parameters were statistically analyzed and 
      compared. RESULTS: The OAB-q well correlated with voiding diary and urodynamic 
      data of Parkinson subjects either at baseline or after the antimuscarinic 
      treatment. The study suggests that this clinical tool might be used for 
      neurogenic overactive bladder diagnosis and that it seems to be a useful outcome 
      measure for treatments of neurogenic OAB.

TI  - International multicenter pilot study of the first comprehensive self-completed 
      nonmotor symptoms questionnaire for Parkinson's disease: the NMSQuest study.
PG  - 916-23
AB  - Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) of Parkinson's disease (PD) are not well recognized in 
      clinical practice, either in primary or in secondary care, and are frequently 
      missed during routine consultations. There is no single instrument (questionnaire 
      or scale) that enables a comprehensive assessment of the range of NMS in PD both 
      for the identification of problems and for the measurement of outcome. Against 
      this background, a multidisciplinary group of experts, including patient group 
      representatives, has developed an NMS screening questionnaire comprising 30 
      items. This instrument does not provide an overall score of disability and is not 
      a graded or rating instrument. Instead, it is a screening tool designed to draw 
      attention to the presence of NMS and initiate further investigation. In this 
      article, we present the results from an international pilot study assessing 
      feasibility, validity, and acceptability of a nonmotor questionnaire (NMSQuest). 
      Data from 123 PD patients and 96 controls were analyzed. NMS were highly 
      significantly more prevalent in PD compared to controls (PD NMS, median = 9.0, 
      mean = 9.5 vs. control NMS, median = 5.5, mean = 4.0; Mann-Whitney, 
      Kruskal-Wallis, and t test, P < 0.0001), with PD patients reporting at least 10 
      different NMS on average per patient. In PD, NMS were highly significantly more 
      prevalent across all disease stages and the number of symptoms correlated 
      significantly with advancing disease and duration of disease. Furthermore, 
      frequently, problems such as diplopia, dribbling, apathy, blues, taste and smell 
      problems were never previously disclosed to the health professionals.

TI  - Risk factors for specific upper limb disorders as compared with non-specific 
      upper limb pain: assessing the utility of a structured examination schedule.
PG  - 243-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few community-based epidemiological investigations of upper limb 
      disorders (ULDs) have classified cases by validated procedures involving a 
      structured clinical examination. AIM: To compare risk factor profiles for 
      different diagnostic categories of ULD using one such examination scheme. 
      METHODS: A questionnaire about upper limb pain and demographic, occupational and 
      psychosocial risk factors was mailed to 10,264 adults from two English general 
      practices, followed by standardized physical examination in those with arm or 
      neck pain. Logistic regression was used to compare those with specific ULDs and 
      non-specific arm pain with those who had no neck or arm symptoms. RESULTS: There 
      was a 59% response rate. A total of 1,197 subjects with arm or neck pain 
      underwent standardized physical examination and were classified as having one or 
      more of 11 specific ULDs or non-specific regional pain. Among these, 250 subjects 
      with specific ULDs and 176 with only non-specific arm pain were compared with 
      2,248 subjects who had no neck or arm symptoms. Certain physical risk factors 
      were more strongly associated with specific disorders than with non-specific 
      pain. In comparison with pain-free subjects, the odds ratios (ORs) in keyboard 
      users (>or=1 h versus <1 h/day) were 3.1 (95% CI 1.3, 7.8) for hand-wrist 
      tendonitis but 1.3 (0.8, 2.1) for non-specific hand-wrist pain. Other 
      differential associations were found with age, sex, manual versus non-manual 
      employment and smoking. Unexpectedly, low vitality was similarly associated with 
      both specific disorders and non-specific pain. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest 
      that the schedule may usefully distinguish disorders that differ in their 
      association with physical risk factors.

TI  - A diagnostic formulation for anosognosia in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 719-25
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the earliest symptoms of anosognosia in people with 
      Alzheimer's disease and to validate a criteria-guided strategy to diagnose 
      anosognosia in dementia. METHODS: A consecutive series of 750 patients with very 
      mild or probable Alzheimer's disease attending a memory clinic, as well as their 
      respective care givers, was assessed using a comprehensive psychiatric 
      evaluation. RESULTS: The factors of anosognosia for (1) basic activities of daily 
      living (bADL), (2) instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), (3) depression 
      and (4) disinhibition were produced by a principal component analysis on the 
      differential scores (ie, caregiver score minus patient score) on the anosognosia 
      questionnaire for dementia. A discrepancy of two or more points in the 
      anosognosia-iADL factor was found to have a high sensitivity and specificity to 
      identify clinically diagnosed anosognosia in people with Alzheimer's disease. By 
      logistic regression analysis, the severity of dementia and apathy were both shown 
      to be noticeably associated with anosognosia in people with Alzheimer's disease. 
      CONCLUSION: Anosognosia in those with Alzheimer's disease is manifested as poor 
      awareness of deficits in iADL and bADL, depressive changes and behavioural 
      disinhibition. The frequency of anosognosia is found to increase considerably 
      with the severity of dementia. The validity of a specific set of criteria to 
      diagnose anosognosia in people with Alzheimer's disease was shown, which may 
      contribute to the early identification of this condition.

TI  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer disease and cognitively impaired, 
      nondemented elderly from a community-based sample in Brazil: prevalence and 
      relationship with dementia severity.
PG  - 438-45
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to describe the prevalence of 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia in Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitively 
      impaired nondemented (CIND) subjects from a community-based Brazilian sample and 
      to correlate these symptoms with severity of cognitive deficits. METHOD: A total 
      of 1,563 randomly selected subjects were evaluated with the following screening 
      tests: Mini-Mental Status Examination, Fuld Object Memory Evaluation, Informant 
      Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, and Activities of Daily 
      Living-International Scale. Screen positives were submitted to a workup for 
      dementia, physical and neurologic examination, cranial computed tomography or 
      cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, the Cambridge Examination for Mental 
      Disorders, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), and the Neuropsychiatric 
      Inventory (NPI). Diagnosis was made according to Diagnostic and Statistical 
      Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria. RESULTS: Sixty patients 
      with AD, 25 CIND, and 78 healthy elderly subjects were evaluated. Informants 
      reported that 78.33% of patients with AD had one or more neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms. Apathy (53.33%), depression (38.33%), sleep alterations (38.33%), and 
      anxiety (25%) were the most prevalent disturbances in AD subjects. These 
      disturbances were more prevalent in patients with AD than in the comparison group 
      and CIND individuals. In the CIND group, the most frequent neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms were anxiety and sleep alterations (both with 24%) followed by 
      depression (16%). Total NPI scores were significantly different between AD and 
      CIND groups, AD and comparison groups, and CIND and the comparison group. Apathy 
      was the only neuropsychiatric symptom that was significantly different between 
      the groups divided according to the CDR being more frequent in subjects with 
      moderate to severe dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms seem to be as 
      common in patients living in a developing country as they are in demented 
      patients from the developed world. Indeed, the fact that some of our results are 
      similar to other population-based studies may suggest that cultural factors play 
      a minor role in the emergence of these symptoms, at least in a Latin American 
      country like Brazil.

TI  - The Lille apathy rating scale (LARS), a new instrument for detecting and 
      quantifying apathy: validation in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 579-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is usually defined as reduced interest and participation in 
      various activities. It is a frequent consequence of neurological and psychiatric 
      disorders. Although various scoring methods have been proposed, there is a lack 
      of validated, standardised instruments for detecting apathy and assessing its 
      severity. OBJECTIVE: To develop an apathy rating scale using a structured 
      standardised interview capable of distinguishing between the condition's various 
      features. METHODS: The Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) is based on a structured 
      interview. It includes 33 items, divided into nine domains. Responses are scored 
      on a dichotomous scale. The participants used to validate the scale consisted of 
      159 patients with probable Parkinson's disease and 58 healthy control subjects. 
      The Marin Apathy Scale, the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and 
      the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale were also administered. RESULTS: Principal 
      component analysis showed that the LARS probed a single construct which forms the 
      root of an oblique factor structure reflecting four dimensions: intellectual 
      curiosity, self awareness, emotion, and action initiation. The main psychometric 
      properties of the LARS (internal consistency, inter-rater and test-retest 
      reliability) were satisfactory. Concurrent validity was evaluated by reference to 
      the Marin scale and to judgements provided by expert clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Standard validity indices showed that the LARS is sensitive and capable of 
      distinguishing between apathy and depression. As a screening tool, the scale is 
      able to support dichotomous judgements accurately and, when greater measurement 
      sensitivity is required, also determine the severity of apathy within a four 
      category classification.

TI  - [Determination of factors conditioning adherence and accomplishment of renal 
      protection diet in patients with chronic renal failure: pilot study for the 
      elaboration of a dietary guideline].
PG  - 145-54
AB  - There are seldom studies on dietary behavior of patients with chronic renal 
      failure (CRF). The aim of this study has been to know, by means of a previously 
      validated questionnaire, which are the psycho-sociocultural factors that affect, 
      and to what extent, assumption and adherence the dietary therapy while 
      determining the degree of disease perception and several factors related with it. 
      The study population is comprised by 81 patients from the nephrology clinic of 
      the "12 de Octubre" Hospital of Madrid, with CRF in a pre-dialysis status. 
      Seventy-seven point seventy-four percent answered "well" or "very well" to 
      questions relating to disease knowledge and perception. Emotional and 
      auto-management factors have little relevance according to 69.87% of patients. 
      Fifty-nine point twenty-six percent feel a high level of familial support, and 
      35.77% alters dietary behavior when environmental conditions change. Most of the 
      interviewees (87.65%) do not have difficulties finding the prescribed foods, and 
      70.37% considers their cost is not excessive. For almost half of the patients 
      (48.76%), renal protection diet represents a variation in their dietary habits, a 
      similar percentage expresses difficulty with elaboration. Food palatability is 
      not a problem in 67.90% of the cases. Fifty-one point twenty-four percent does 
      not perceive difficulty with cooking procedures. Seventy point ninety-nine 
      percent feels support in one way or the other, by health care staff, although 
      just 56.79% reports that the diet has not been explained to them. Only 18.51% 
      questions the diet effectiveness as regards to their disease course. As for the 
      gender variable, there were significant differences (p < 0.05), with a higher 
      influence on men, in sections relating to disease knowledge, and influence of 
      apathy and family support, the women those having the highest scores for food 
      management, diet transgression at family meetings, and less information received 
      about the prescribed diet. As for family support, there are significant 
      differences only by age groups, patients aged more than 65 years being those 
      feeling more this psychological support. The group of patients with a creatinine 
      clearance less than 25 mL/min is the one expressing less categorically their 
      appreciation on diet effectiveness. There are factors in which significant 
      difficulty percentages are observed and that may induce diet transgression, in 
      some cases without the patient being completely aware of, such as environmental 
      changes, change in traditional habits, the degree of diet explanation, the 
      organoleptic characteristics, and the lack of knowledge of appropriate cooking 
      procedures. All these indicators confirm the need for enhancing nutritional 
      education of these patients and their family environment, also showing the need 
      for a nutritional intervention that completely supports patients in the process 
      of adaptation and maintenance of their new dietary habit.

TI  - The measurement of social disablement and assessment of psychometric properties 
      of the Social Behaviour Schedule (SBS-BR) in 881 Brazilian long-stay psychiatric 
      patients.
PG  - 101-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on the prevalence of social disablement in long-stay psychiatric 
      patients, and the assessment of the psychometric properties of the instruments 
      that evaluate social behaviour in this population are scarce in Brazil. 
      Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to estimate the prevalence rates of 
      social disablement in a population of long-stay psychiatric patients from the Rio 
      de Janeiro metropolitan area, and assessed the psychometric properties of the 
      Social Behaviour Schedule (SBS). METHOD: Data were collected from a population of 
      881 psychiatric patients housed in the Municipal Mental Health Institute using 
      the 21-item SBS. RESULTS: Most of the patients were women (59%), the mean age was 
      65.8 years (SD = 11) and the mean length of stay was 37.3 years (SD = 11.5). Of 
      the population, 50.6% were scored as having poor self-care, 46% with little 
      spontaneous communication, 41.1% with poor attention span, and 37.1% with 
      underactivity. Comparing our data with international studies that used the same 
      instrument, we found that our population was more disabled than the others, 
      especially on the social withdrawal factor. Regarding psychometric properties, 
      the inter-rater kappa was 0.709, the inter-informant kappa was 0.500, and the 
      Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.766. The groups of patients in the six 
      settings of the institute presented significant statistical differences in the 
      total score (F = 11.447, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the 
      high rates of social disablement in this population. The precarious conditions of 
      the institution where the patients have been living for decades and unmet 
      individual care may have exacerbated their social disablement. Furthermore, the 
      SBS-BR had satisfactory psychometric properties, particularly reliability, 
      showing it to be an adequate instrument for measuring social disablement in 
      Brazil.

TI  - A flexible item to screen for depression in inner-city minorities during 
      palliative care symptom assessment.
PG  - 228-36
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is inconsistent evidence for the validity of a single item to 
      screen depression. In inner-city minority populations, the "yes/no" 
      forced-response option may encourage bias, especially in elders and men, who view 
      depression as stigmatizing or the healthcare system as untrustworthy. In 
      contrast, an open-choice format with a category for ambivalent and missing 
      responses could be acceptable if administered during the legitimized context of a 
      physical symptom assessment. METHOD: Retrospective data were analyzed from 146 
      black and Latino inner-city patients receiving palliative care for various 
      physical conditions. Bivariate analyses and ordinal regressions are based on the 
      most recent comprehensive patient assessment conducted by a black female nurse 
      and a bilingual Latina social worker. RESULTS: The depression item (no, unknown, 
      yes) predicts pain and symptom attitude, which is more "hopeful" in older men 
      with unknown depression status than in younger and older women with unknown 
      depression status or no depression. CONCLUSIONS: The more "hopeful" pain and 
      symptom attitudes by older men in the unknown category for depression suggest 
      that depression, apathy, and resignation in older minority men may be hidden from 
      clinicians in the absence of the open-choice depression item.

TI  - A comparison of depressive mood of older adults in a community, nursing homes, 
      and a geriatric hospital: factor analysis of Geriatric Depression Scale.
PG  - 26-31
AB  - The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)-15 was used in 607 adults aged 65+ years 
      living in a community, nursing homes, and a general hospital to explore 
      characteristics of depressive mood in different care settings. Factor analysis of 
      GDS-15 extracted 4 factors labeled unhappiness, apathy and anxiety, loss of hope 
      and morale, and energy loss. The scale scores labeled unhappiness, apathy and 
      anxiety, and loss of hope and morale were negatively correlated with the Barthel 
      Index and the Mini-Mental State Examination scores. The results classified the 
      depressive patterns into 2 types, one fitting the nursing home residents and the 
      other fitting the hospital patients. The dominant factors of the nursing-home 
      type were unhappiness and loss of hope and morale, and the hospital type was 
      highly related with apathy and anxiety. The results indicate an extended utility 
      of the GDS-15 for a deeper understanding of depressive mood in various care 
      settings.

TI  - Gender differences in bipolar-II disorder.
PG  - 67-71
AB  - Gender differences in bipolar-II disorder (BP-II) are understudied. STUDY AIM: 
      was to test if there were gender differences in the clinical and family history 
      features of BP-II. METHODS: Consecutive 374 BP-II private practice outpatients 
      were interviewed by a senior psychiatrist using the Structured Clinical Interview 
      for DSM-IV, modified to improve the detection of BP-II (by Benazzi and Akiskal 
      2003, J Affect Disord 73:33-38), the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale 
      (MADRS), the Hypomania Interview Guide, and the Family History Screen. Logistic 
      regression was used to study associations and control for confounding. Alpha 
      level was set at 0.05; P was two-tailed. RESULTS: Females represented 67.3% of 
      the group. The female to male ratio was independent of age. Females were more 
      common in younger onset BP-II. Females, versus males, had significantly lower age 
      at onset, more axis I comorbidity, atypical depressions, intra-depression 
      hypomanic symptoms (i. e., mixed depression), and family history of suicidal 
      behavior. On the MADRS, females had more sadness, loss of energy, loss of 
      interest, and suicidal ideas. The symptom structure of hypomanic episodes was 
      similar between females and males. LIMITATIONS: Single interviewer, outpatient 
      sample, private practice study setting. DISCUSSION: Clinical differences were 
      found between BP-II females and males. Differences were found only on the 
      depressive pole of the disorder. However, the magnitude of the differences had 
      not a strong clinical significance, suggesting that at present, on the basis of 
      the variables and the population studied, there is little ground to support a 
      female BP-II depression.

TI  - Characterizing behavioral and cognitive dysexecutive changes in progressive 
      supranuclear palsy.
PG  - 199-207
AB  - Frontal lobe dysfunction is a prominent feature of many neurological disorders. 
      Early diagnosis may be enhanced by establishing a profile of cognitive, 
      behavioral, and emotional change. Traditional psychometric assessment focuses on 
      cognitive dysfunction and fails to identify behavioral changes, particularly 
      those associated with orbitofrontal dysfunction. We examined progressive 
      supranuclear palsy (PSP), a prototypical subcortical dementia with frontal 
      features, using commonly available neuropsychological measures and a modification 
      of the Katz Adjustment Scale-Relatives (KAS-R), an instrument first developed to 
      assess dysexecutive changes in head-injured patients. Executive tests identified 
      deficits in reasoning, planning, set shifting, verbal fluency, information 
      processing speed, and response initiation. On the KAS-R, changes in apathy, 
      social withdrawal, and independence were observed, with little change in 
      belligerence, social irresponsibility, uncooperativeness, obstreperousness, 
      anxiety, and depression. The results show the potential utility of this 
      instrument in characterizing behavioral and emotional changes associated with 
      frontal lobe dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease.

TI  - Neuropsychological performance in mild cognitive impairment with and without 
      apathy.
PG  - 192-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the neuropsychological characteristics of patients 
      diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with and without apathy. METHODS: 
      A cohort of 245 MCI patients (mean age = 72 +/- 5.5 years; mean MMSE = 27.5 +/- 
      1.3) was divided into two subgroups according to their Apathy Inventory score and 
      underwent an extensive neuropsychological battery. RESULTS: There were 94 (38.4%) 
      patients with and 151 (61.6%) patients without apathy. At baseline the apathetic 
      subgroup had a significantly lower total score on the free and cued selective 
      reminding test (FCSR). Furthermore, the apathetic subgroup showed a significant 
      deterioration in FCSR total recall score between baseline and the 1-year 
      assessment. In conclusion, the presence of apathy in MCI patients is not 
      associated with frontal task performance but with a higher degree of memory 
      impairment.

TI  - Determinants of the quality of life in Alzheimer's disease patients as assessed 
      by the Japanese version of the Quality of Life-Alzheimer's disease scale.
PG  - 182-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although QOL is an important indicator to assess multiple facets of 
      life, the QOL of Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects with impaired cognitive 
      ability due to dementia has not yet been fully investigated. In this study, we 
      developed the Japanese version of the Quality of Life-Alzheimer's disease 
      (QOL-AD) scale by means of back-translation, and ascertained its reliability and 
      validity for evaluating the quality of life in AD subjects. We also hypothesized 
      that the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms may determine the characteristics 
      and determinants of both the patients' and the caregivers' responses to the 
      patients' QOL questionnaire. METHODS: We administered the QOL-AD questionnaire to 
      subjects with mild or moderate AD (n = 140). The test-retest reliability was 
      evaluated by the same interviewer after a month's interval. Data from the 
      following tests were also collected to ascertain the validity of the 
      questionnaire: Short Memory Questionnaire (SMQ), Neuropsychiatry Inventory (NPI), 
      Hyogo Activities of Daily Living Scale (HADL) and Mini-Mental State Examination 
      (MMSE). RESULTS: The Japanese version of the QOL-AD questionnaire demonstrated 
      good internal reliability for both the patients' (Cronbach's alpha = 0.84) and 
      the caregivers' responses (Cronbach's alpha = 0.82) and good test-retest 
      reliability for both the patients' (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.84) 
      and caregivers' reports (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.91). The 
      concordance between the patients' self-report and the caregivers' observation was 
      moderate (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.60). The score for the 'mood 
      factor' (apathy, depression/dysphoria) in NPI predicted the overall QOL score as 
      determined from both the patients' and the caregivers' responses for subjects 
      with mild (MMSE>or=21, n = 88) and moderate (MMSE< 21, n = 52) AD. The score for 
      the 'psychosis factor' (delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, agitation, 
      disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor activity) in NPI predicted the total 
      QOL score as determined by the patients and the caregivers among subjects with 
      moderate AD only. CONCLUSIONS: As hypothesized, the presence of neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms may be an important predictor of both the patients' and caregivers' 
      responses to the patients' QOL questionnaire. QOL-AD appears to be a promising 
      measure of the QOL of subjects with mild to moderate AD in Japan.

TI  - Delirium-O-Meter: a nurses' rating scale for monitoring delirium severity in 
      geriatric patients.
PG  - 1158-66
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common psychiatric disorder in general hospital elderly 
      patients. Several delirium screening tests exist. Few nurse based delirium 
      severity measures are available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      Delirium-O-Meter, a new nurses' behavioural rating scale that is an efficient and 
      sensitive measure of delirium severity. METHODS: Analysis of cross sectional and 
      repeated assessments data. Participants were 92 elderly general hospital 
      patients; 56 with delirium, 24 with dementia or other cognitive disturbances (no 
      delirium) and 12 with other psychiatric disorders or no mental disorder. Measures 
      were the Delirium-O-Meter (DOM), Delirium Rating Scale-Revised version 
      (DRS-R-98), Delirium Observation Scale (DOS), Behavioural observation scale for 
      geriatric inpatients (GIP) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). RESULTS: The 
      majority of DOM items show a (near-) normal score distribution. Reliability of 
      the DOM was high; Cronbach's alpha values ranged from 0.87-0.92; Intra Class 
      Correlation (ICC) range was 0.84-0.91 for total scores and 0.40-0.97 for item 
      scores. Factor analysis produced a 'Cognitive/Motivational' factor explaining 
      almost half of variance and a smaller 'Psychotic/Behavioural' factor. The 
      two-factor model results support the conceptual distinction between hyperactive 
      and hypoactive delirium. DOM observations differentiated delirium from non 
      delirium patients. DOM total scores were highly related to the DRS-R-98, DOS, 
      MMSE and GIP apathy and cognitive sub scales, but less so to the GIP affective 
      disturbances subscale, indicating convergent and divergent validity. Temporal 
      difference scores calculated for DRS-R-98 and DOM assessments on subsequent days 
      were also highly related (rho = 0.80-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: The newly constructed 
      DOM is a brief and valid nurses' behavioural rating scale that can be useful for 
      measuring different aspects of delirium and for efficiently monitoring delirium 
      severity in elderly patients.

TI  - The construct of minor and major depression in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 2086-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the frequency of major and minor depression in 
      Alzheimer's disease and determined whether these types of depression have a 
      different functional and psychopathological impact and whether there is a change 
      in the prevalence of major and minor depression throughout the stages of 
      Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: A consecutive series of 670 patients with probable 
      Alzheimer's disease were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for 
      DSM-IV; specific instruments to rate the presence and severity of depression, 
      anxiety, apathy, irritability, delusions, pathological affective crying, 
      performance of activities of daily living, and social functioning; and a 
      standardized neuropsychological evaluation. Diagnoses of major and minor 
      depression were generated from DSM-IV criteria. RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of 
      the patients had major depression, 26% had minor depression, and 48% were not 
      depressed. Major depression was significantly associated with sad mood in all 
      three stages of the illness, although this association dropped significantly for 
      minor depression in severe Alzheimer's disease. Both major and minor depression 
      were significantly associated with more severe psychopathology, functional 
      impairments, and social dysfunction. Depressive symptoms that most strongly 
      discriminated between Alzheimer's disease patients with and without sad mood were 
      guilty ideation, suicidal ideation, loss of energy, insomnia, weight loss, 
      psychomotor retardation/agitation, poor concentration, and loss of interest. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that DSM-IV criteria for major and minor 
      depression identify clinically relevant syndromes of depression in Alzheimer's 
      disease, mild levels of depression can produce significant functional impairment, 
      and the severity of psychopathological and neurological impairments increases 
      with increasing severity of depression.

TI  - Neuroanatomical correlates of behavioural disorders in dementia.
PG  - 2612-25
AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with profound changes in social and 
      emotional function. The emergence of increasingly sophisticated methods for 
      measuring brain volume has facilitated correlation of local changes in tissue 
      content with cognitive and behavioural changes in neurodegenerative disease. The 
      current study examined neuroanatomical correlates of behavioural abnormalities, 
      as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, in 148 patients with dementia 
      using voxel-based morphometry. Of 12 behaviours examined, 4 correlated with 
      tissue loss: apathy, disinhibition, eating disorders and aberrant motor 
      behaviour. Increasing severity across these four behaviours was associated with 
      tissue loss in the ventral portion of the right anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) 
      and adjacent ventromedial superior frontal gyrus (vmSFG), the right ventromedial 
      prefrontal cortex (VMPC) more posteriorly, the right lateral middle frontal 
      gyrus, the right caudate head, the right orbitofrontal cortex and the right 
      anterior insula. In addition, apathy was independently associated with tissue 
      loss in the right vmSFG, disinhibition with tissue loss in the right subgenual 
      cingulate gyrus in the VMPC, and aberrant motor behaviour with tissue loss in the 
      right dorsal ACC and left premotor cortex. These data strongly support the 
      involvement of the right hemisphere in mediating social and emotional behaviour 
      and highlight the importance of distinct regions on the medial wall of the right 
      frontal lobe in regulating different behaviours. Furthermore, the findings 
      underscore the utility of studying patients with dementia for understanding the 
      neuroanatomical basis of social and emotional functions.

TI  - Alzheimer's disease and frontal variant of frontotemporal dementia-- a very brief 
      battery for cognitive and behavioural distinction.
PG  - 1238-44
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate whether a brief neuropsychological 
      battery consisting of a limited number of cognitive tests and an evaluation of 
      the behavioural domains intended to discriminate between frontotemporal dementia 
      (fv-FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), constitutes a useful instrument for making 
      a differential clinical diagnosis between these two pathologies. Nineteen fv-FTD 
      and 39 AD patients were compared on cognitive tasks (assessing memory, executive 
      functions, language and constructional praxis) and on the NPI behavioural 
      assessment. A stepwise discriminant analysis was performed to identify the linear 
      combination of cognitive and behavioural measures able to best discriminate 
      between the two groups. One test for each of the investigated cognitive domains 
      (Delayed Prose Recall, FAS verbal fluency, Boston naming test, Rey's Figure A 
      Copy) and the four subscales of the Neuropsychiatry Inventory (NPI) which best 
      differentiated between fv-FTD and AD patients (apathy, disinhibition, euphoria, 
      aberrant motor behaviour) were used. The analysis selected Rey's Figure A Copy, 
      FAS verbal fluency and NPI apathy subscale as the best discriminants between 
      fv-FTD and AD patients. The final equation assigned 73.7% of the fv-FTD patients 
      and 94.7% of the AD patients to the correct diagnostic group. A validation study 
      conducted on a new independent sample of 11 fv-FTD and 22 AD patients confirmed 
      the high sensitivity (82.6 %) and specificity (81.8%) of the diagnostic equation 
      in assigning fv-FTD and AD patients to the correct dementia group. Although both 
      cognitive and behavioural differences exist between FTD and AD, previous studies 
      have aimed at differentiating the two pathologies by considering the two aspects 
      separately and discriminant analyses were focused only on neuropsychological or 
      neuropsychiatric evaluations. The present results emphasise the importance of 
      rating both cognitive and behavioural clinical features of the two syndromes as 
      objectively as possible to improve differential diagnostic accuracy.

TI  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia-frequency, relationship to dementia 
      severity and comparison in Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and 
      frontotemporal dementia.
PG  - 43-8
AB  - Noncognitive behavioral and psychiatric disturbances are common in dementia and 
      help in the clinical differentiation of the various subtypes. We studied the 
      frequency of neuropsychiatric disturbances, their relationship to dementia 
      severity and compared these disturbances in Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular 
      dementia (VaD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) using the 12-item 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). A total of 98 patients (AD-44, VaD-31, FTD-23) 
      were evaluated. All subjects were community dwelling at the time of evaluation. 
      The three groups were comparable on global dementia severity and functional 
      ability. All patients had clinically significant scores on the NPI with apathy, 
      irritability and agitation being very common (>90% of patients). AD and VaD 
      patients in Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) stage 2 had significantly higher 
      scores on the total NPI, agitation and disinhibition subscales compared to those 
      in CDR stage 1. Mean scores in the domains of aberrant motor behavior, 
      disinhibition and appetite/eating behavior differentiated FTD from AD and VaD. 
      Neuropsychiatric disturbances in dementia appear to be universal with agitation, 
      disinhibition and irritability being more frequent in the later stages. In this 
      cohort disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior and appetite/eating disturbances 
      could reliably differentiate AD and VaD from FTD. There were no significant 
      differences between the neuropsychiatric profiles of AD and VaD.

TI  - Specificity of symptoms of depression in Alzheimer disease: a longitudinal 
      analysis.
PG  - 802-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Authors examined the temporal stability of symptoms of major and minor 
      depression and apathy in dementia. METHODS: A consecutive sample of 65 patients 
      with Alzheimer disease (AD) and depression at baseline evaluation received a 
      follow-up psychiatric assessment that included the Structured Clinical Interview 
      for DSM-IV and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression an average of 17 months 
      later. RESULTS: Half of the sample had no depression at follow-up, and showed a 
      significant improvement in sadness, guilt, suicidal ideation, disruption in 
      sleep, loss of interest, loss of energy, thoughts of death, social withdrawal, 
      psychomotor changes, changes in appetite/weight, and symptoms of anxiety. No 
      significant changes were found on scores of irritability or apathy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The study demonstrates the specificity of depressive symptoms in AD and suggests 
      that apathy and depression are different behavioral domains.

TI  - Impact of cognitive impairment on the phenomenology of geriatric depression.
PG  - 694-700
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dementia and depressive syndromes demonstrate substantial symptom 
      overlap. As a result, it is challenging to differentiate depression symptoms from 
      nonspecific symptoms of an underlying dementia syndrome. The author addressed the 
      impact of cognitive impairment on the phenomenology of depression symptoms by 
      determining whether more impaired patients were more likely to endorse certain 
      self-report depressive symptoms independent of their underlying level of 
      depression severity. METHODS: Author used data from 576 geriatric rehabilitation 
      inpatients for MIMIC model analyses examining the impact of cognitive impairment 
      on both depression severity and endorsement of symptom clusters. Depressive 
      symptoms were measured with the Geriatric Depression Scale, and cognitive 
      impairment was measured with the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale total score. 
      RESULTS: The reliability (internal consistency) of self-reported depressive 
      symptoms did not change as a function of cognitive impairment. More severe 
      cognitive impairment was associated with greater depression severity but was also 
      associated with two depression symptom clusters after controlling for underlying 
      levels of depression severity. Patients who were more impaired endorsed greater 
      social withdrawal and less psychomotor agitation, independent of their underlying 
      depression severity. Level of cognitive impairment alone did not affect the 
      endorsement of depressed mood and positive affect. CONCLUSIONS: Certain symptoms 
      on depression inventories may be endorsed at a greater level by cognitively 
      impaired patients, independent of their level of underlying depression severity. 
      These symptoms may be nonspecific features of the underlying dementia syndrome 
      and may not be specific to depressive episodes, but instead may represent other 
      syndromes, such as apathy.

TI  - On the overlap between apathy and depression in dementia.
PG  - 1070-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whereas apathy is increasingly recognised as a frequent abnormal 
      behaviour in dementia, its overlap with depression remains poorly understood. 
      AIMS: To assess the psychometric characteristics of a structured interview for 
      apathy, and to examine the overlap between apathy and depression in dementia. 
      METHODS: A total of 150 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) underwent a 
      comprehensive psychiatric and cognitive assessment. RESULTS: Twelve per cent of 
      the sample met criteria for both apathy and depression, 7% met criteria for 
      apathy only, and 31% met criteria for depression only. Apathy (but not 
      depression) was significantly associated with more severe cognitive deficits. 
      Apathy and anxiety scores accounted for 65% of the variance of depression scores 
      in dementia, and the diagnosis of apathy had a minor impact on the rating of 
      severity of depression. CONCLUSIONS: The Structured Interview for Apathy 
      demonstrated adequate psychometric characteristics. Using a novel structured 
      interview for apathy in AD we demonstrated that whereas the construct of 
      depression primarily consists of symptom clusters of apathy and anxiety, apathy 
      is a behavioural dimension independent of depression.

TI  - Self-injurious behaviour in nursing home residents with dementia.
PG  - 651-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the phenomenology and prevalence of Self-Injurious 
      Behaviour (SIB) in nursing home patients with dementia. METHOD: Cross-sectional 
      study of 110 nursing home patients with dementia. Nurses' ratings of SIB and 
      other behavioural disturbances were compared to independent resident physician 
      ratings of medical charts data pertaining to dementia type, dementia severity, 
      prescribed psychotropic drugs, immobility and measures to restrain the patient. 
      Instruments used were the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS, modified), Behaviour 
      Rating Scale for Psychogeriatric Inpatients (GIP), Rating scale for Older 
      Patients (BOP). RESULTS: SIB was observed in 22% of the dementia patients. 
      Pinching or scratching oneself and banging one's fist against objects were most 
      frequently reported. Five patients showed a combination of two types of SIB. As 
      expected, SIB was modestly related to Aimless repetitive behaviour and Aggression 
      and no association was found between SIB and Apathy. Correlates of SIB were 
      prescribed psychotropics (i.e. benzodiazepines), immobility and measures to 
      restrain the patient. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data suggest that SIB is a 
      specific psychopathological phenomenon that is highly prevalent in nursing home 
      patients with dementia. Future research should focus on the aetiology and 
      treatment of SIB.

TI  - Prevalence of symptoms possibly related to PADAM, in a Swedish population aged 
      55, 65 and 75 years.
PG  - 161-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: With age there is an average decline in the concentration of 
      biologically active testosterone. It is still controversial if this leads to a 
      clinically relevant deficit, "partial androgen deficiency of the ageing man" 
      (PADAM). Our objective was to investigate the prevalence of a series of symptoms 
      possibly associated with PADAM in an assumed normal-population of older men. 
      METHODS: We developed a questionnaire including items about symptoms possibly 
      associated with PADAM as well as background data covering demography, medical 
      history, mood status, medication, castration therapy, as well as smoking, 
      exercise and alcohol habits. The 10 items of the ADAM-questionnaire, designed to 
      predict low bio-available T, were also included. The questionnaire was sent to 
      all 1885 men 55, 65 or 75-years-old, living in Linköping, Sweden. RESULTS: We 
      identified a number of symptoms that differed significantly (P < 0.01) between 
      age groups, e.g., "increased abdominal circumference", "decrease in muscle 
      strength and/or endurance", "decreased libido", "less strong erection" and "lack 
      of energy". From factorial analysis we found that the symptoms co-varied in four 
      different groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of a number of symptoms differed 
      significantly between age groups, but we cannot infer that there is a causal 
      connection between an average age-dependent decline in testosterone function and 
      these symptoms. There are several other ways to interpret these results like the 
      existence of concurrent somatic and/or mood disorders or ageing as such. For this 
      purpose further studies including measurements of testosterone concentrations 
      relating to the findings of this study have to be performed.

TI  - Use of the QOL-AD for measuring quality of life in people with severe 
      dementia--the LASER-AD study.
PG  - 130-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) scales are particularly 
      important in older people as global outcome measures for interventions. It is 
      known that people with mild to moderate dementia can provide valid assessments of 
      their own QOL, but it is unclear whether these instruments are useful in those 
      with severe dementia. OBJECTIVE: We examined the usefulness of the QOL scale in 
      Alzheimer's disease (QOL-AD) in people with severe dementia by considering the 
      ability of older people with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of <12 
      and their caregivers to complete this scale, as well as its construct validity 
      and internal consistency. METHODS: Data were collected from people with 
      Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers using a range of instruments measuring 
      cognition, mood, behaviour, QOL and functional ability. RESULTS: Of 79 
      participants and their caregivers, 41 (52%) could complete the QOL-AD. Cognition 
      and functional abilities were significantly higher in the completers than in the 
      non-completers (P < 0.001). The QOL-AD showed internal consistency and construct 
      validity as it correlated with ability to look after self, fewer limitations due 
      to physical health, positive mood status and low levels of apathy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      There is evidence for the validity and reliability of the QOL-AD in people with 
      MMSE scores of 3-11, as well as the practicality of administering the scale in 
      this population. The scale is unlikely to generate useful information for people 
      with MMSE scores of <3. QOL does not decrease as cognition worsens. This throws 
      into question most people's assumption that decreasing cognition worsens QOL. We 
      consider that it may be important to inform the public of this, as living wills 
      are used increasingly in our culture.

TI  - Effects of methylphenidate on cognition and apathy in normal pressure 
      hydrocephalus: a case study and review.
PG  - 46-50
AB  - The psychostimulant methylphenidate has been previously shown to improve 
      cognitive performance in both normal control volunteers and patient populations. 
      In the present case study, the effects of methylphenidate on cognitive and 
      behavioural function were examined in a single patient with idiopathic normal 
      pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) who had undergone ventriculoperitoneal shunting. A 
      double-blind placebo-controlled ABBA drug design was employed, with the 
      administration of two different doses of methylphenidate followed by 
      neuropsychological assessment on a number of psychometric tests and cognitive 
      tasks drawn from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery 
      (CANTAB). Methylphenidate produced a dose-dependent positive improvement in 
      behavioural measures in the patient associated with a reduction in apathy. It 
      also had a dose-independent enhancing effect on performance of a Spatial 
      Recognition task. These findings require replication in a large sample of 
      patients to determine whether methylphenidate may prove to be generally useful in 
      enhancing cognition and reducing apathy in normal pressure hydrocephalus.

TI  - Symptom profile of DSM-IV major and minor depressive disorders in first-ever 
      stroke patients.
PG  - 108-15
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Depressive disorders are very common in stroke patients. However, 
      vegetative and cognitive symptoms primarily derived from brain damage could 
      hypothetically be indistinguishable from those directly derived from 
      neuropsychiatric disorders, and this could invalidate the diagnostic assessment. 
      Thus, authors aimed to detect the frequency of clinically-rated DSM-IV depressive 
      symptoms and the diagnostic validity of depressive disorders in stroke patients 
      suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD), minor depressive disorder (MIND), 
      and those free of any neuropsychiatric disorders (NODEP). METHODS: First-ever 
      stroke patients (N=200) were approached within 3 months of the acute stroke and 
      were interviewed with the SCID-P and administered the Hamilton Rating Scale for 
      Depression (Ham-D), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Barthel Index, and 
      the Mini-Mental State Exam. RESULTS: Fifty patients (25%) had MDD, 62 (31%) had 
      MIND, and 88 (44%) had NODEP. Global cognitive level, functional impairment, 
      total scores, and psychic and somatic subscores of the Ham-D and the BDI were 
      different among the three groups. The only symptom that did not differ among 
      patients with MDD, MIND, and NODEP was Feelings of Guilt; all the other eight 
      DSM-IV symptoms were significantly different. In particular, the frequency of 
      Depressed Mood, Diminished Interest or Pleasure, Fatigue or Loss of Energy, 
      Insomnia, and Psychomotor Agitation/Retardation was higher in MIND patients than 
      in NODEP patients. CONCLUSIONS: During the diagnostic procedure for depressive 
      disorders in stroke patients, clinicians should consider equally important 
      vegetative, cognitive, and psychological depressive symptoms, despite their 
      nature.

TI  - Motivational symptoms of depression mask preclinical Alzheimer's disease in 
      elderly subjects.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Althoughthe relationship between depressive disorders and Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) is debated, there is evidence that depression may be an early 
      symptom of dementia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate depression features prospectively in 
      elderly subjects with a view to identifying a subgroup affected by preclinical 
      AD. METHODS: We performed a cohort study on cognitive performances with a 
      12-month follow-up in out-patients referred to the local Neuropsychology Clinic 
      complaining of memory problems. Two hundred and twenty-two consecutive 
      non-demented subjects were studied using a neuropsychological battery and the 
      Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and assessed again 1 year later for the possible 
      onset of cognitive impairment. Multivariate analysis was performed to detect 
      independent predictors of dementia development among age, education, 
      neuropsychological test scores and BDI scores and subscores. BDI subscores were 
      obtained by dividing items into three domains corresponding to mood-related, 
      somatic and motivation-related symptoms. RESULTS: At the time of the first 
      evaluation, 124 of the 222 subjects were depressed according to DSM-III-R 
      criteria. At 1 year, 31 of the 124 depressed subjects and 2 non-depressed ones 
      had AD according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. Stepwise logistic regression analysis 
      indicated that the subjects who went on to develop dementia had significantly 
      higher total BDI scores and motivational BDI subscores. Among depressed subjects, 
      the probability of being diagnosed with dementia during follow-up was 
      significantly associated with a motivational BDI subscore > or = 7 (odds ratio: 
      3,885, 95% Cl 154-97,902). COMMENT: Close neuropsychological follow-up of 
      depressed elderly subjects complaining of memory failure and showing apathy is 
      recommended to detect the early stage of AD.

TI  - Confirmatory factor analysis of the geriatric depression scale.
PG  - 818-26
AB  - PURPOSE: The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is widely used in clinical and 
      research settings to screen older adults for depressive symptoms. Although 
      several exploratory factor analytic structures have been proposed for the scale, 
      no independent confirmation has been made available that would enable 
      investigators to confidently identify scores for the subdimensions of depression 
      represented in the scale. DESIGN AND METHODS: This article describes a 
      confirmatory factor analysis of the 30-item GDS, with the factor structure based 
      on an exploratory principal components analysis that was published earlier. The 
      original study sample consisted of 327 community-dwelling adults aged 65-94 
      years. The confirmatory factor analysis was performed on data from an independent 
      sample of 294 adults aged 60-98 years who resided in retirement facilities. 
      RESULTS: The proposed final measurement model uses 26 of the items from the GDS 
      in five factors and obtains a goodness-of-fit index of.90. The resulting distinct 
      subdimensions are Dysphoric Mood, Withdrawal-Apathy-Vigor, Hopelessness, 
      Cognitive, and Anxiety. IMPLICATIONS: Although results should be considered 
      preliminary, the use of these five subdimensions as subscales for scoring 
      purposes may improve the precision and utility of the GDS as an assessment tool 
      for older adults in health, mental health, and research contexts.

TI  - Patients' perspectives on noncompliance with diabetic retinopathy standard of 
      care guidelines.
PG  - 709-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodic dilated eye examinations are recommended by the American 
      Optometric Association, American Academy of Ophthalmology, and American Diabetes 
      Association to detect sight-threatening conditions in diabetic patients. However, 
      many patients with diabetes do not receive this recommended eye care and there is 
      limited research to explain why. The objective of this study was to determine 
      reasons some diabetic patients do not receive a dilated eye examination at least 
      every year. METHODS: A chart review identified patients at The Ohio State 
      University College of Optometry who had not been examined for more than a year, 
      but less than two years. A telephone interview was attempted for all subjects. 
      RESULTS: Of 100 eligible subjects, 43 completed the telephone interview. The 
      reasons patients with diabetes did not return for a recommended dilated eye 
      examination included transfer of care to another eye doctor, limited personal 
      mobility due to poor overall health, last examination at a homeless clinic, 
      self-reported lack of insurance, and self-reported apathy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Strategies to improve compliance of patients with diabetes should include 
      reaching patients of low socioeconomic status and those institutionalized for 
      poor overall health. Improved compliance may also come by encouraging patients to 
      use medical insurance for eye examinations and using patient recall systems.

TI  - The reliability of clinical and biochemical assessment in symptomatic late-onset 
      hypogonadism: can a case be made for a 3-month therapeutic trial?
PG  - 1066-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether testosterone (T) supplementation in men considered 
      to have symptomatic late-onset hypogonadism (SLOH) can be evaluated clinically 
      and biochemically. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To assess the relevance of the clinical 
      and biochemical diagnosis of hypogonadism we investigated patients referred for 
      the diagnosis and treatment of SLOH. Patients were assessed clinically and 
      completed a screening questionnaire. The pituitary-adrenal-gonadal axis was 
      comprehensively assessed biochemically. Those with a clinical diagnosis of 
      hypogonadism and serum levels of T supporting such a diagnosis received exogenous 
      T for >/= 3 months and were assessed for any clinical and biochemical response. 
      Of an initial group of 45 men (mean age 59.2 years) 38 completed the study. 
      RESULTS: Most men presented with symptoms of sexual dysfunction, lack of energy 
      and/or depression. There were differences before and after treatment only in 
      bioavailable T (BT), with none in the levels of total T (TT). There was a strong 
      correlation before and after treatment in the levels of luteinizing hormone and 
      follicle-stimulating hormone, and a weak negative correlation between 
      gonadotrophins and BT. Neither TT nor BT had predictive value for the treatment 
      response. There was a trend to a correlation between BT levels and treatment 
      success. Changes in serum prostate specific antigen were insignificant during the 
      limited period. CONCLUSION: The lack of accurate methods for diagnosing SLOH 
      suggests that a therapeutic trial of T supplementation is warranted in men in 
      whom there are no contraindications. The 3-month period largely circumvents the 
      placebo effect and has minimal risks for serious adverse effects (mostly in 
      relation to prostate safety). This controversial position needs further 
      evaluation with a larger cohort and other biochemical measurements.

TI  - Behavioural and psychological syndromes in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 1035-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The origins of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia are 
      still poorly understood. By focusing on piecemeal behaviours as opposed to more 
      robust syndrome change valid biological correlates may be overlooked. Our 
      understanding of BPSD via the identification of neuropsychiatric syndromes. 
      METHODS: We recruited 435 subjects from old age psychiatry and elderly care 
      memory outpatient clinics fulfilling the criteria for diagnosis of probable 
      Alzheimer's disease. Behavioural and psychological symptoms were assessed using 
      the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Principal components factor analysis was carried 
      out on the composite scores of the 12 symptom domains to identify behavioural 
      syndromes (factors). Results were confirmed by performing three different 
      rotations: Varimax, Equamax and Quartimax. RESULTS: Four factors were identified 
      (which accounted for 57% of the variance): 'affect' factor-depression/dysphoria, 
      anxiety, irritability/lability and agitation/aggression; 'physical behaviour' 
      factor-apathy, aberrant motor behaviour, sleep disturbance and appetite/eating 
      disturbance; 'psychosis' factor-delusions and hallucinations; 'hypomania' 
      factor-disinhibition and elation/euphoria. These groups were unchanged when 
      different methods of rotation were used. CONCLUSIONS: We report novel 
      observations that agitation/aggression/irritability cluster within a depressive 
      symptom factor and apathy is found within a physical behaviour factor.

TI  - Routine screening for depression in radiation oncology patients.
PG  - 497-9
AB  - PURPOSE: Depression is a debilitating illness with symptoms that overlap those of 
      cancer and radiotherapy. We sought to measure the frequency of depression in 
      adult radiation oncology patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Beck Depression 
      Inventory-II (BDI-II) was incorporated into routine clinical evaluation of 
      patients. Results were analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariate analysis 
      of variance (MANOVA). RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four patients were screened and 
      19 (15%) endorsed significant depressive symptoms. Of these, levels of depression 
      were: 58% mild, 32% moderate, and 10% severe. Twenty-six percent of the depressed 
      group had a history of previous psychiatric diagnoses and 32% previously had been 
      placed on psychotropic medications. The most frequent somatic symptoms for the 
      entire group were loss of energy (73%) and tiredness or fatigue (69%). All 
      depressed patients endorsed some somatic symptoms, but these alone were 
      insufficient to score in the range of depression. CONCLUSIONS: A simple tool can 
      be administered in the clinic by radiation oncologists to screen for depression. 
      The frequency of depression in our patients was 15%. Somatic symptoms alone were 
      insufficient to score as depressed.

TI  - Potential treatment effects of donepezil not detected in Alzheimer's disease 
      clinical trials: a physician survey.
PG  - 954-60
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clinical trials of the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil have used 
      standard psychometric tools to evaluate treatment efficacy. These trials, 
      however, appear not to capture clinically demonstrable, but otherwise unmeasured, 
      beneficial treatment effects. We sought to identify and categorize clinically 
      recognizable effects of donepezil treatment in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: A 
      list of potential effects was developed using clinical trials data and the 
      experience of an expert panel. These were incorporated in a questionnaire, which 
      was tested with a focus group, revised and then used in a postal survey of 
      physicians. Data were classified by cognitive domain, and reviewed by a second 
      panel. RESULTS: Items that were most often rated as being improved were related 
      to frontal systems function, including attentional capacity and initiative. 
      Behavioral symptoms that were among the highest rated items were apathy, mood, 
      and agitation. The top two other items were social interactions and involvement 
      in domestic activities. Of the top ten symptomatic treatment effects, only four 
      appeared to be readily identified by current standard measures. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Physicians recognize as important several treatment effects that are not well 
      captured by current standard measures. New methods are needed to capture such 
      effects, which also have the potential to offer insight into the neurobiology of 
      the human cholinergic system.

TI  - Depression among southern rural African American women: a factor analysis of the 
      Beck Depression Inventory-II.
PG  - 251-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: This is the first reported study involving a factor analysis of the 
      Beck Depression Inventory-II, which was administered to a sample of southern 
      rural African American women. OBJECTIVE: To determine the factor structure of the 
      Beck Depression Inventory-II using data collected from southern rural African 
      American women. METHODS: Using a correlational, descriptive design, 206 southern 
      rural African American women were invited to participate in a face-to-face 
      interview that occurred in a variety of community-based settings. RESULTS: The 
      factor analysis of the Beck Depression Inventory-II resulted in a two-factor 
      solution. Symptoms such as pessimism and worthlessness loaded high on the first 
      factor (cognitive). The second factor explained somatic-affective symptoms of 
      depression, with factor loadings high on tiredness and fatigue and loss of 
      energy. CONCLUSIONS: The application of the Beck Depression Inventory-II among 
      African American people would generate needed information about how depressive 
      symptoms may be expressed among them. Knowledge gained from this study promises 
      to be useful for developing appropriate research studies and population-specific 
      treatment approaches for this group of women.

TI  - Factor structure and differential validity of the expanded Brief Psychiatric 
      Rating Scale.
PG  - 177-87
AB  - The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is one of the most widely used measures 
      in psychiatric outcome and clinical psychopharmacology research. To date, 
      however; research on the psychometric properties of the expanded version of the 
      BPRS (BPRS-E) has been limited. An exploratory factor analysis (n = 360) using 
      maximum likelihood extraction with oblimin rotation found a four-factor solution 
      (Thought Disturbance, Animation, Mood Disturbance, Apathy) to underlie the 
      BPRS-E. Furthermore, these factors were logical in nature and estimates of 
      internal consistency were acceptable. A confirmatory factor analysis conducted on 
      a second, independent sample (n = 280)found that for the five models currently 
      available in the literature, the model developed herein provided the best fit to 
      the data. Again, estimates of internal consistency were found acceptable. 
      Finally, the four factors demonstrated appropriate differential validity with 
      regards to both demographic variables and various psychiatric diagnoses.

TI  - Case-finding for depressive and exhausted mood in the general population: 
      reliability and validity of a symptom-driven diagnostic scale. Results from the 
      prospective MONICA/KORA Augsburg Study.
PG  - 332-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Depressed and exhausted mood warrants epidemiological scrutiny as a 
      cardiovascular risk factor. We evaluated the reliability and validity of a 
      symptom-driven diagnostic scale. METHODS: To assess a depressed mood, items were 
      derived from an extended battery of psychosocial questionnaires in a 
      population-based study including 11,949 subjects aged 25 to 74 years. RESULTS: 
      Eight items from the 24-item von Zerssen checklist were extracted by factor 
      analysis resulting in an approximately normally distributed scale (range 0-24; 
      mean=8.23, SD 4.76). Median for men was 8.00 and 10.00 for women. Its internal 
      consistency was high (Cronbach's alpha 0.88). Test-retest reliability of a 
      sub-sample was 0.83. Determining concurrent validity, correlation coefficients 
      against a single depression questionnaire in 8237 subjects (p < 0.001) and SF-36 
      subscales (vitality and mental health) (both p < 0.0001) in 4226 subjects proved 
      to be significant. Construct validity was confirmed by significant associations 
      (all p < 0.001) with sleeping complaints, social isolation, and unhappiness. Test 
      values for men above the 80th percentile exhibited significant hazard ratios for 
      subsequent total mortality (80th percentile: HR 2.17, 95% CI: 1.31-13.55). 
      CONCLUSION: The scale comprises eight items describing motivational depletion, 
      decreased vitality, irritability, and an anxious mood with sufficient internal 
      and external reliability, concurrent and construct validity. Its normal 
      distribution allows a graduated analysis of different thresholds. The instrument 
      may be particularly useful to identify exhausted and depressed mood of otherwise 
      apparently healthy subjects in the general population.

TI  - Paroxetine does not improve symptoms and impairs cognition in frontotemporal 
      dementia: a double-blind randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 400-8
AB  - RATIONALE: Patients with frontal variant frontotemporal dementia (fvFTD) present 
      with disinhibition, impulsiveness, apathy, altered appetite and stereotypic 
      behaviors. A non-randomized clinical trial found improvement in these symptoms 
      after treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). OBJECTIVES: 
      We aimed to subject a SSRI, paroxetine, to a more rigorous test of its efficacy 
      using a double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental design. METHODS: Ten 
      subjects meeting the consensus criteria for FTD were entered into a double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled crossover trial. Doses of paroxetine were progressively 
      increased to 40 mg daily. The same regimen was used for placebo capsules. 
      Subjects were assessed with a battery of cognitive tests in the sixth week of 
      paroxetine and placebo treatment. At each assessment, caregivers were interviewed 
      using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and asked to complete the Cambridge 
      Behavioral Inventory. RESULTS: There were no significant differences on the 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory or the Cambridge Behavioral Inventory. Paroxetine 
      caused a decrease in accuracy on the paired associates learning task, reversal 
      learning and a delayed pattern recognition task. There were no changes on the 
      decision-making task, in spatial span, spatial recognition, spatial working 
      memory, digit span and verbal fluency. CONCLUSIONS: This study finds no evidence 
      for the efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of fvFTD. The results suggest 
      that a chronic course of paroxetine may selectively impair paired associates 
      learning, reversal learning and delayed pattern recognition. This pattern of 
      deficits closely resembles that seen after tryptophan depletion. Results are 
      discussed with respect to current theories on serotonergic modulation of 
      orbitofrontal/ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

TI  - Validity and reliability of the newly translated Hellenic Neuropsychiatric 
      Inventory (H-NPI) applied to Greek outpatients with Alzheimer's disease: a study 
      of disturbing behaviors among referrals to a memory clinic.
PG  - 203-8
AB  - CONTEXT: No rating scales of the neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients with 
      dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have previously been developed or 
      translated. OBJECTIVES: To develop a Hellenic translation of the Neuropsychiatric 
      Inventory (NPI), to evaluate it's reliability and validity, and to compare NPI 
      results in Greek patients referred to a neuropsychiatry clinic for either of two 
      reasons: disturbing behaviors evoking embarrassment and disturbing behaviors 
      evoking fear in the caregiver. METHODS: The Hellenic translations of the NPI, 
      Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and Emotional Distress Scale (EDS) were 
      compared in evaluating 29 consecutive referrals of patients with AD. RESULTS: The 
      Hellenic NPI (H-NPI) demonstrated a high degree of internal consistency 
      reliability, and of concurrent validity when compared to the BPRS or the EDS. 
      Patients referred for behaviors evoking embarrassment presented with higher 
      scores on NPI ratings of apathy. However, patients referred for behaviors evoking 
      fear presented with higher scores on NPI ratings of aggression and irritability. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the H-NPI is a reliable instrument, able 
      to detect differences in clinically referred groups of AD patients.

TI  - Do maternal psychotic symptoms predict offspring's psychotic disorder? Findings 
      from the Helsinki High-Risk Study.
PG  - 105-15
AB  - The Helsinki High-Risk (HR) Study is a follow-up study of 179 offspring born to 
      mothers with DSM-IV-TR diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, 
      other schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and affective psychoses. Mothers 
      comprised all female patients born between 1916 and 1948 who had been treated 
      with hospital diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or schizoaffective 
      psychoses in any mental hospital in the city of Helsinki up to 1974, and who had 
      given birth in Helsinki between 1960 and 1964. In this report we conducted a 
      principal factor analysis of maternal symptoms using 12 items of the Major 
      Symptoms of Schizophrenia Scale (MSSS), the global ratings of 
      anhedonia-asociality and avolition-apathy from the Scale for the Assessment of 
      Negative Symptoms (SANS), and the global rating of bizarre behavior from the 
      Scale for the Assessment of Positive symptoms (SAPS), and examined whether the 
      factor scores predicted the offspring's morbidity from psychotic disorders. We 
      found a four-factor solution (negative, positive, catatonic, and affective 
      symptom factors). High maternal positive symptom factor score significantly 
      predicted decreased morbidity from schizophrenia among offspring (P=0.0098). Our 
      result suggests that maternal positive symptoms are less harmful to the child 
      than other maternal psychotic symptoms, and supports the view that positive 
      symptoms are non-specific symptoms of psychosis rather than core features of 
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Perception of males' aging symptoms, health and well-being in elderly 
      community-dwelling men is not related to circulating androgen levels.
PG  - 201-14
AB  - Aging in men is associated with a progressive but variable decline in androgen 
      production. In aging men there is also an increased occurrence of symptoms such 
      as lack of concentration, nervousness, impaired memory, depressive mood, 
      insomnia, lack of energy and general sense of well-being, decreased libido and 
      erectile dysfunction, periodic sweating, bone and joint complaints, reduction of 
      strength and increased adiposity. This ill-defined male climacterium syndrome is 
      often referred to as "andropause", with the underlying implication that it is at 
      least in part related to (relative) androgen deficiency. Recently an "aging 
      males" symptoms' (AMS) rating scale was developed aimed at a more systematic 
      description of severity of symptoms related to a clinically defined "male 
      climacteric". We studied the relationship of male climacteric symptoms as 
      assessed by the AMS with androgen levels and other questionnaires assessing the 
      perception of health and well-being. Serum levels of sex steroids, sex hormone 
      binding globulin and gonadotropins were measured in blood samples of 161 healthy, 
      ambulatory, elderly men, aged 74-89 years who also completed the AMS scale. Mean 
      value of total, free and bioavailable testosterone in this group was 401.6, 6.8 
      and 151.4 ng/dl, respectively, with 24.7, 32.4 and 52.2% of the values under the 
      normal range for young men. The results of the AMS scores mostly suggested mild 
      psychological and mild to moderate somatovegetative symptoms. However, clear 
      sexual symptoms were reported in 88% of cases. None of the three AMS domain scale 
      scores significantly correlated with testosterone, free testosterone or 
      bioavailable testosterone. Significant correlations were observed between results 
      for the AMS scores and those for other health questionnaires, but none of the 
      subscores for the latter questionnaires correlated with androgen serum levels. In 
      conclusion, the results of this study have shown that, as assessed by the AMS, 
      healthy ambulatory elderly males over 70 had a high perception of sexual symptoms 
      with mild psychological and mild to moderate somatovegetative symptoms. These 
      data failed to support the view that in healthy elderly men, "climacteric 
      symptoms" can predict androgen levels.

TI  - Changing investment in activities and interests in elders' lives: theory and 
      measurement.
PG  - 87-108
AB  - Socioemotional selectivity and gerotranscendence, newer theories with roots in 
      the disengagement theory of aging, provided the theoretical framework for a new 
      measure of perceived change in investment in a variety of pursuits. The 30-item 
      Change in Activity and Interest Index (CAII) was given to a sample of 327 
      outpatients aged 65-94. Items with at least 30% decreased investment responses 
      included Entertaining in my home, Concern with others' opinions, Shopping and 
      buying things, and Attending social events with new people. Principal Components 
      Analysis of the index with dichotomous recoding (less vs. more or same 
      investment) resulted in four factors: Active Instrumental (AI), Social 
      Intellectual (SI), Spiritual Concerns (SC), and Transcendence (TR). Support for 
      socioemotional selectivity and gerotranscendence is evident in the reported 
      increase of importance of SI pursuits, with concurrent decrease in importance of 
      AI activities among these respondents. Zero-order correlations of component 
      scores with study variables suggest that AI and SI are more clearly related to 
      older age, functional impairment, and negative affect than are SC and TR. The 
      CAII appears to tap several dimensions of change in interests; the index gives 
      geriatric mental health practitioners and researchers a tool to measure an aspect 
      of social development that has been neglected in gerontology.

TI  - The use of the Minimum Data Set to identify depression in the elderly.
PG  - 308-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether depression in the elderly in institutionalized 
      settings could be identified using the mood indicators in the Minimum Data Set 
      (MDS) 2.0 (Section E1, Items A-P). DESIGN: Descriptive study. SETTING: Three 
      nursing homes in the southeastern part of the country. PARTICIPANTS: Residents 
      aged 65 and above. MEASUREMENTS: The items in "Indicators of Depression, Anxiety 
      and Sad Mood" on the MDS 2.0 were used to identify observable features of 
      depression in the elderly. The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) 
      was used to validate the MDS indicators. Consensus analysis, which controls 
      raters' bias, raters' ability, and item difficulty, was used to analyze data. 
      RESULTS: No depressive patterns were detected using the MDS indicators. On the 
      CSDD, distinct depressive features were identified: anxiety, sadness, lack of 
      reaction to pleasant events, irritability, agitation, multiple physical 
      complaints, loss of interest, appetite loss, and lack of energy. CONCLUSION: The 
      incongruent findings on the MDS indicators the CSDD may be reflective of the 
      assessment process used with the MDS rather than its ability to identify features 
      of elderly depression. The practice of allowing nondirect caregivers to complete 
      the MDS may have serious implications for the accuracy of the data collected.

PG  - 146-50
AB  - Apathy is defined as a disorder of motivation that expresses itself at an 
      emotional, cognitive and behavioural level. Apathy can occur as a symptom and a 
      syndrome. In the recent years diagnostic criteria and a number of scales for 
      measuring apathy in elderly with psychiatric or neurological disorders have been 
      introduced. Two scales are specifically developed to measure apathy, the Apathy 
      Evaluation Scale (AES) from Marin and the Apathy Scale (AS) from Starkstein. Both 
      scales have been translated into Dutch. The AS is more convenient. The AS in 
      addition can be used when applying the criteria for the apathy syndrome which has 
      been introduced in 2001 by Starkstein. In addition, the Neuropsychiatric 
      Inventory (NPI) and the 'Gedragsobservatieschaal voor de Intramurale 
      Psychogeniatrie' (GIP) (a scale in Dutch) have an apathy domain. Conceptual 
      problems surrounding apathy have only partly been resolved. The criteria for the 
      apathy syndrome can only be used for assessing the extent of the problem. Apathy 
      and depression are strongly correlated. Studies show that apathy as a syndrome 
      can occur without concomitant depression in the elderly, but regularly occurs 
      besides a depressive disorder, in percentages varying between 9% and 53% of the 
      population under study. Especially the varying validity of an apathy syndrome in 
      relation to late life depression needs further clarification.

TI  - A comparison of three fatigue measures in veterans with cancer.
PG  - 363-73
AB  - Fatigue is a highly prevalent and distressing symptom in cancer patients. The 
      purpose of this study was to assess the validity of three fatigue measures [the 
      Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy 
      Fatigue Subscale (FACT-F), and the lack of energy item from the Memorial Symptom 
      Assessment Scale Short Form (MSAS-SF)] and compare these measures in relation to 
      broader quality-of-life (QOL) constructs and clinical factors in veteran cancer 
      patients. One-hundred-eighty cancer patients completed the BFI, FACT-F, FACT-G, 
      MSAS-SF, and the Zung depression scale with concurrent Karnofsky performance 
      status (KPS), laboratory tests, and demographic data. The Cronbach alpha 
      coefficient was from 0.93 to 0.94 for BFI fatigue scales and 0.94 for FACT-F. 
      There were significant correlations between BFI subscales, FACT-F, and lack of 
      energy from MSAS-SF (p < 0.0001). All three fatigue measures showed significant 
      correlation with MSAS-SF symptom subscales (p < 0.0001), FACT-G subscales (p < 
      0.0001), depression (p < 0.0001), KPS (p < 0.0001), inpatient status (P < 
      0.0001), insomnia (p < 0.05), hemoglobin (p < 0.05), and albumin levels (p < 
      0.01). Distress from lack of energy discriminated among levels from the BFI, 
      FACT-F, and FACT-G subscales and MSAS-SF subsclea by one-way of variance 
      analysis. Patient responses to BFI, FACT-F, and the lack of energy item yielded 
      similar information about broader QOL constructs and clinical factors. Single 
      questions about lack of energy, or fatigue severity, may provide a simple and 
      acceptable way to assess fatigue.

TI  - Apathy and executive function in depressed elderly.
PG  - 112-6
AB  - Apathy and executive cognitive dysfunction (ECD) are important though 
      conceptually different aspects of late-life depression. The primary objective of 
      this study was to evaluate the relationship of apathy to ECD. The authors also 
      evaluated the relationship of apathy and ECD to global cognitive impairment and 
      word generation. Fifty-two elderly subjects with major depression and MMSE scores 
      of 15 or greater were evaluated with apathy-related items from the Hamilton 
      rating scale for depression (ApHRSD), the Executive Interview (EXIT), the 
      Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), and the Controlled Oral Word Association test 
      (COWA). ApHRSD scores were not significantly correlated with any of these 
      variables. EXIT scores were correlated significantly with DRS and COWA. The 
      results suggest that apathy and ECD may be independent of each other in some 
      samples of elderly with late-life depression. Correlations may have been reduced 
      by low variance for the variables of interest and by psychometric limitations of 
      the ApHRSD.

TI  - Fatigue in the general population.
PG  - 140-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue symptoms are often found in cancer patients. One test to 
      assess fatigue is the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20). It has been 
      successfully applied to specific groups of cancer patients. However, until now 
      population-based norm values are missing. METHODS: We conducted an investigation 
      on a representative sample of the adult German population, which comprised 2,037 
      subjects aged 14-92 years. RESULTS: The reliability of the 5 MFI-20 subscales 
      (general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced activity, reduced motivation, and 
      mental fatigue) is satisfying. The correlations between MFI-20 subscales and the 
      fatigue scale of the quality-of-life questionnaire EORTC indicate convergent 
      validity. As an important result we found that all subscales of the MFI-20 showed 
      a clear and nearly linear dependency on age with higher fatigue values for older 
      subjects (p < 0.0001). Females as compared with males are characterized by higher 
      mean values in all MFI-20 subscales (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results show 
      that it is necessary to take into account age and sex when different groups of 
      cancer patients have to be compared.

TI  - Validation evidence for the French Canadian adaptation of the Multidimensional 
      Fatigue Inventory as a measure of cancer-related fatigue.
PG  - 143-54
AB  - Cancer-related fatigue is the most reported symptom among patients with cancer. 
      Researchers in the field of psychooncology have encouraged the development of 
      short instruments, which allow for easier completion by clinical populations 
      while still maintaining solid psychometric properties. The current study examined 
      the validity and reliability of the French Canadian adaptation of the 
      Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) among women (n = 277) and men (n = 327) 
      undergoing therapy for breast or prostate cancer, respectively. An exploratory 
      factor analysis of the selected 15-item MFI yielded the following four factors: 
      general/physical, mental, reduced motivation, and reduced activity. This was 
      supported by a confirmatory factor analysis. The reliability, as evaluated by 
      test-retest and Cronbach alpha internal consistency reliability coefficients of 
      the French Canadian shortened MFI, was acceptable. In addition, the four 
      factor-based scores correlated in a theoretically meaningful manner with existing 
      measures of mood disturbance (Profile of Mood States and Hospital Anxiety and 
      Depression Scale), cancer-related stressors (Inventory of Recent Life 
      Experiences), coping with illness (Coping with Health Injuries and Problems 
      Scale), quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of 
      Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire), and insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), 
      suggesting good construct, convergent, and concurrent criterion validity. 
      Although further validation is recommended, the results for the French Canadian 
      MFI in assessing cancer-related fatigue in both women and men undergoing cancer 
      treatments showed good psychometric qualities.

TI  - Social networks, social integration, and social engagement determine cognitive 
      decline in community-dwelling Spanish older adults.
PG  - S93-S100
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the influence of social networks and social engagement on 
      cognitive decline in a population-based cohort of elderly people, and to assess 
      gender differences in the effect of social relations on cognition. METHODS: A 
      longitudinal study of community-dwelling people over 65 was carried out. 
      Cognitive function (orientation and memory) in 1997 and cognitive decline 
      (absent, mild, and severe) over 4 years (1993-1997) were assessed using an 
      instrument previously validated for populations with a low level of education. 
      The effect of social networks, social integration, and social engagement with 
      friends, children, and relatives on cognitive function and cognitive decline was 
      estimated by multiple linear and logistic regressions after adjusting for age, 
      sex, education, depressive symptoms, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and 
      functional status. RESULTS: Poor social connections, infrequent participation in 
      social activities, and social disengagement predict the risk of cognitive decline 
      in elderly individuals. The probability of cognitive decline was lower for both 
      men and women with a high frequency of visual contact with relatives and 
      community social integration. Engagement with friends seemed to be protective for 
      cognitive decline in women but not in men. DISCUSSION: This longitudinal study 
      indicates that few social ties, poor integration, and social disengagement are 
      risk factors for cognitive decline among community-dwelling elderly persons. The 
      nature of the ties that influence cognition may vary in men and women.

TI  - Executive dysfunction and apathy predict functional impairment in Alzheimer 
      disease.
PG  - 214-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which executive 
      cognitive dysfunction and frontally-mediated behavioral disturbances are 
      associated with functional impairment in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer 
      disease (AD). METHODS: Patients with AD (N=45) completed the Mattis Dementia 
      Rating Scale, and patients' caregivers completed the Frontal Systems Behavioral 
      Inventory and a modified form of the Lawton and Brody Activities of Daily Living 
      (ADLs) Questionnaire. RESULTS: Multiple-regression analyses revealed that 
      executive cognitive dysfunction and apathy scores accounted for 44% of the 
      variance in instrumental activities of daily living; executive cognitive 
      dysfunction alone explained 17% of the variance in instrumental ADLs, and apathy 
      scores explained an additional 27%. Executive dysfunction and frontal-behavioral 
      impairment explained 28% of the variance in basic ADLs (BADLs), and, after 
      accounting for executive dysfunction, apathy was the only symptom found to 
      explain additional unique variance in BADLs. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest 
      that specific cognitive and behavioral symptoms are associated with functional 
      impairment in patients with AD.

TI  - Lifetime depressive and somatic symptoms as preclinical markers of late-onset 
      depression.
PG  - 16-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several risk factors of depression, i. e., female gender and 
      life-stress, have been identified. Few studies have focussed on symptoms as 
      preclinical markers of depression. In these studies current symptoms like 
      dysphoria, tiredness and increased appetite predicted later depression. Even 
      though of possible interest for treatment, no study focussed on lifetime symptoms 
      as preclinical markers of depression. Consequently, we examined lifetime 
      depressive and somatic symptoms with respect to later development of late-onset 
      depression. METHODS: 664 non-depressed elderly subjects without lifetime 
      diagnoses of depression at the initial examination were selected for a 
      prospective follow-up study (mean follow-up +/- SD: 5.02 +/- 2.44 years). 51 
      subjects (mean age +/- SD: 66.6 +/- 11.3) developing late-onset depression 
      (defined as depression starting after age 60) were compared to those remaining 
      non-depressed (mean age +/- SD: 59.1 +/- 16.0) during follow-up using the CIDI. 
      To determine the influence of lifetime symptoms on the development of depression, 
      chi-square statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses were 
      performed. RESULTS: The following symptoms being present over a period longer 
      than two weeks were individual preclinical markers of late-onset depression: 
      dysphoria, increased appetite, insomnia, lack of energy, morning depth, lack of 
      joy and interest, inferiority feeling, lack of self-confidence, poor 
      concentration, indecisiveness, thinking about death, wish to die and joint pain. 
      The most important symptoms elevating the risk of late-onset depression in a 
      multivariate model were lack of joy and interest, poor concentration, increased 
      appetite, lack of energy and joint pain. CONCLUSIONS: Different symptoms can be 
      used individually and in combination to predict later depression. This might 
      allow early treatment.

TI  - The apathy inventory: assessment of apathy and awareness in Alzheimer's disease, 
      Parkinson's disease and mild cognitive impairment.
PG  - 1099-105
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to establish the validity and reliability of 
      the apathy inventory (IA), a rating scale for global assessment of apathy and 
      separate assessment of emotional blunting, lack of initiative, and lack of 
      interest. METHOD: Information for the IA can be obtained from the patient or from 
      a caregiver. We evaluated 115 subjects using the IA, consisting of 19 healthy 
      elderly subjects, 24 patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), 12 subjects 
      with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 60 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      RESULTS: Internal consistency, item reliability, and between-rater reliability 
      were high. A test-retest reliability study demonstrated that caregiver responses 
      to IA questions were stable over short intervals. A concurrent validity study 
      showed that the IA assesses apathy as effectively as the Neuro Psychiatric 
      Inventory apathy domain. In the caregiver-based evaluation, AD subjects had 
      significantly higher scores than controls, both for global apathy score and for 
      the lack of interest dimension. When the AD patients were subdivided according to 
      diagnostic criteria for apathy, apathetic patients had significantly higher 
      scores than non apathetic patients. With the patient-based evaluations, no 
      differences were found among the AD, MCI and control groups. The scores in the 
      patient-based evaluations were only higher for the PD group versus the control 
      subjects. The results also indicated that AD patients had poor awareness of their 
      emotional blunting and lack of initiative. CONCLUSIONS: The IA is a reliable 
      method for assessing in demented and non-demented elderly subjects several 
      dimensions of the apathetic syndrome, and also the subject's awareness of these 
      symptoms.

TI  - Depression induced by treatment with interferon-alpha in patients affected by 
      hepatitis C virus.
PG  - 237-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies found a high incidence rate of neuro-psychiatric 
      complications during long-term therapy with interferon alpha (IFNalpha), e.g. 
      slowness, severe fatigue, hypersomnia, lethargy, depressed mood, mnemonic 
      troubles, irritability, short temper, emotional lability, social withdrawal, and 
      lack of concentration. The aim of this study was to examine the incidence of 
      depressed mood and major depression in patients who were treated with IFNalpha. 
      METHODS: 30 patients, affected by chronic active C-hepatitis, have been evaluated 
      at baseline and 3 months after IFNalpha treatment. The evaluation consisted of 
      psychometric assessments employing the DSM-IV criteria and the Montgomery Asberg 
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: At end-point, 40.7% of the patients 
      suffered from a full blown major depression, according to the DSM-IV criteria for 
      major depression. IFNalpha treatment induced a significant increase in the MADRS 
      score from baseline to 3 months later. The MADRS items which were significantly 
      increased at end-point were: expressed and unexpressed sadness; irritability; 
      insomnia; loss of appetite; and asthenia. DISCUSSION: The results show that 
      prolonged IFNalpha treatment may induce depressive symptoms and major depression 
      in a considerable number of subjects.

TI  - Apathy in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 636-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess apathy in patients with Parkinson's disease and its relation 
      to disability, mood, personality, and cognition. METHODS: Levels of apathy in 45 
      patients with Parkinson's disease were compared with a group of 17 similarly 
      disabled patients with osteoarthritis. Additional neuropsychiatric data were 
      collected concerning levels of depression, anxiety, and hedonic tone. Personality 
      was assessed with the tridimensional personality questionnaire. Cognitive testing 
      included the mini-mental state examination, the Cambridge examination of 
      cognition in the elderly, and specific tests of executive functioning. RESULTS: 
      Patients with Parkinson's disease had significantly higher levels of apathy than 
      equally disabled osteoarthritic patients. Furthermore, within the Parkinson 
      sample, levels of apathy appear to be unrelated to disease progression. The 
      patients with Parkinson's disease with the highest levels of apathy where not 
      more likely to be depressed or anxious than those with the lowest levels of 
      apathy, though they did show reduced hedonic tone. No differences in personality 
      traits were detected in comparisons between patients with Parkinson's disease and 
      osteoarthritis, or between patients in the Parkinson group with high or low 
      levels of apathy. As a group, the patients with Parkinson's disease tended not to 
      differ significantly from the osteoarthritic group in terms of cognitive skills. 
      However, within the Parkinson's disease sample, the high apathy patients 
      performed significantly below the level of the low apathy patients. This was 
      particularly evident on tests of executive functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Apathy in 
      Parkinson's disease is more likely to be a direct consequence of disease related 
      physiological changes than a psychological reaction or adaptation to disability. 
      Apathy in Parkinson's disease can be distinguished from other psychiatric 
      symptoms and personality features that are associated with the disease, and it is 
      closely associated with cognitive impairment. These findings point to a possible 
      role of cognitive mechanisms in the expression of apathy.

TI  - Nationwide longitudinal study of psychological responses to September 11.
PG  - 1235-44
AB  - CONTEXT: The September 11, 2001, attacks against the United States provide a 
      unique opportunity to examine longitudinally the process of adjustment to a 
      traumatic event on a national scale. OBJECTIVE: To examine the degree to which 
      demographic factors, mental and physical health history, lifetime exposure to 
      stressful events, September 11-related experiences, and coping strategies used 
      shortly after the attacks predict psychological outcomes over time. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A national probability sample of 3496 adults received 
      a Web-based survey; 2729 individuals (78% participation rate) completed it 
      between 9 and 23 days (75% within 9 to 14 days) after the terrorist attacks. A 
      random sample of 1069 panelists residing outside New York, NY, were drawn from 
      the wave 1 sample (n = 2729) and received a second survey; 933 (87% participation 
      rate) completed it approximately 2 months following the attacks. A third survey 
      (n = 787) was completed approximately 6 months after the attacks. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: September 11-related symptoms of acute stress, posttraumatic stress, 
      and global distress. RESULTS: Seventeen percent of the US population outside of 
      New York City reported symptoms of September 11-related posttraumatic stress 2 
      months after the attacks; 5.8% did so at 6 months. High levels of posttraumatic 
      stress symptoms were associated with female sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.64; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.17-2.31), marital separation (OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 
      1.06-6.14), pre-September 11 physician-diagnosed depression or anxiety disorder 
      (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.33-2.56) or physical illness (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.99), 
      severity of exposure to the attacks (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11-1.55), and early 
      disengagement from coping efforts (eg, giving up: OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.27-2.20; 
      denial: OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.07-1.64; and self-distraction: OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 
      1.07-1.59). In addition to demographic and pre-September 11 health variables, 
      global distress was associated with severity of loss due to the attacks (beta 
      =.07; P =.008) and early coping strategies (eg, increased with denial: beta =.08; 
      P =.005; and giving up: beta =.05; P =.04; and decreased with active coping: beta 
      = -.08; P =.002). CONCLUSIONS: The psychological effects of a major national 
      trauma are not limited to those who experience it directly, and the degree of 
      response is not predicted simply by objective measures of exposure to or loss 
      from the trauma. Instead, use of specific coping strategies shortly after an 
      event is associated with symptoms over time. In particular, disengaging from 
      coping efforts can signal the likelihood of psychological difficulties up to 6 
      months after a trauma.

TI  - An informant-based assessment of apathy in Alzheimer disease.
PG  - 176-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To standardize a new rating scale for the assessment of apathy in 
      Alzheimer disease (AD) and report on its reliability, structure, and relation to 
      other clinical features of AD. BACKGROUND: apathy is a common prominent 
      behavioral syndrome accompanying AD and is associated with excess disability and 
      increased caregiver burden. Current instruments for the assessment of apathy in 
      AD do not explicitly and systematically attempt to differentiate limited activity 
      and engagement due to lack of interest from inability or longstanding, premorbid 
      personality traits. The present assessment, the Dementia Apathy Interview and 
      Rating (DAIR), was developed taking these discriminations into account in 
      question construction and interview format. METHODS: One hundred participants 
      (50% women) in the University Memory and Aging Center Research Registry with 
      Probable or Possible AD (by NINCDS-ADRDA criteria) were assessed through 
      caregiver interview or direct patient assessment for apathy, depression, and 
      severity of cognitive and functional deficits. Item distribution characteristics, 
      factor analysis, and evaluation of reliability were used to develop the final 
      item set for the DAIR, and correlations with other measures were examined. 
      RESULTS: A 16-item unidimensional apathy scale with excellent internal 
      consistency (alpha = 0.89) and temporal reliability ( = 0.85 over 2 months) was 
      developed. Individual differences in apathy on the DAIR were unrelated to 
      dysphoria. Apathy was significantly associated with functional and cognitive 
      impairment, while depression was not. CONCLUSIONS: The DAIR is a reliable 
      informant-based assessment of apathy in persons with AD. Although apathy is 
      assessed with respect to behaviors within the repertoire of patients, this 
      behavioral syndrome remains associated with more severe deficits in cognitive and 
      adaptive functioning. Associations between depression and dementia severity 
      reported in some studies may reflect the confounding of apathy and depression in 
      some assessment instruments.

TI  - The Key Behaviors Change Inventory and executive functioning in an elderly clinic 
      sample.
PG  - 251-7
AB  - The Key Behaviors Change Inventory (KBCI) was developed to assess executive, 
      behavioral, and emotional functioning following brain insults and to track the 
      course of recovery. The purpose of this study was to investigate, in an elderly 
      memory disorder clinic sample, the convergent and discriminant validity of the 
      KBCI by examining the relationships between various measures of executive 
      functioning and the KBCI scales that theoretically relate to executive functions. 
      The KBCI was administered to the caregivers of 97 consecutive patients who came 
      to a memory disorders clinic seeking services. The KBCI scales of Inattention, 
      Apathy, Unawareness of Problems, and Communication Problems were significantly 
      correlated with cognitive measures of executive functioning but not with measures 
      of memory, visuospatial abilities or global cognitive functioning. In contrast, 
      KBCI scales of Interpersonal Difficulties, Somatic Difficulties, and Emotional 
      Adjustment were not related to any cognitive measures, either executive or 
      nonexecutive. Contrary to predicted findings, the Impulsivity Scale was not 
      associated with cognitive measures of executive functioning. This lack of 
      relationship most likely reflects the failure to include executive measures of 
      orbitofrontal functioning in this study. Results provide convergent and 
      discriminant validity support for the KBCI. The KBCI may be a useful tool for 
      assessing and tracking the executive, behavioral, and emotional sequelae of 
      neurologic disorders.

TI  - [The behavior rating scale for intramural psychogeriatric inpatients (GIP-28) in 
      homes for the elderly. A psychometric evaluation].
PG  - 112-8
AB  - The GIP-28 is the shortened version of the 82-item Behavior Rating Scale for 
      Psychogeriatric Inpatients. Originally it was meant and psychometrically 
      evaluated for use in psychogeriatric and elderly psychiatric inpatients. We 
      supposed that the GIP-28 might be useful to detect psychosocial and cognitive 
      problems in residents of homes for the elderly. It was therefore tested in 15 
      residential homes (n = 949). The instrument consists of three, 
      factor-analytically derived, scales: 'Apathy', 'Cognition' and 'Affect'. These 
      three principal components were also identified in the data of the inhabitants of 
      the residential homes. Internal consistency of the scales, as measured with 
      Cronbach's Alpha is .75, .66, .80 respectively. Construct validity of the GIP-28 
      is satisfactory: the correlation between the Affect scale and the GDS was .36 and 
      between the Cognition scale and the MMSE was -.36. The GIP-28 was associated with 
      another observation scale for care needs (r = .54). The GIP-28 can be used to 
      detect mental health problems in the population of residential homes. However, it 
      is neither meant nor suited to replace psychiatric diagnostic procedures.

TI  - Cutoff score on the apathy evaluation scale in subjects with traumatic brain 
      injury.
PG  - 509-16
AB  - This cross-sectional study was designed to determine a cutoff score on the Apathy 
      Evaluation Scale (AES) that predicts a clinician's designation of a subject with 
      TBI as apathetic or not. Forty-five outpatients with TBI completed the AES-S, and 
      37 family members, friends, or significant others filled out the AES-I. Three 
      clinicians prospectively gave their impressions of the presence or absence of 
      apathy and retrospectively chose the degree of apathy on a 7-point subjective 
      rating scale. The data was analysed by logistic regression and Receiver Operating 
      Characteristic (ROC) curve. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated. No 
      cutoff score on the AES-S or AES-I was found to have reasonable sensitivity and 
      specificity with respect to the ability to predict the clinician's designation of 
      a subject as apathetic. The AES requires further study if it is to be used to 
      measure apathy following TBI.

TI  - Measuring change in psychiatric symptoms using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory: 
      Nursing Home version.
PG  - 438-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) is a 
      modified version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Accurate interpretation 
      of change in the symptom ratings on the NPI-NH, as with any measure, is a concern 
      for both clinicians and researchers. The purpose of this article is to present 
      data for the interpretation of reliable change in the NPI-NH scores for acute 
      geriatric neuropsychiatry patients. METHOD: Fifty-two geriatric psychiatry 
      inpatients were administered the NPI-NH twice, at a 72-hour interval. Standard 
      errors of difference scores were used to calculate confidence intervals for each 
      of the NPI-NH subscales and the total score. RESULTS: Based on the calculations 
      described above, estimates of reliable change on the individual subscales ranged 
      from plus or minus 1.29 points on the Euphoria/Elation subscale to 5.13 points on 
      the Anxiety subscale. Statistically meaningful change on the Agitation and the 
      Apathy subscales was established at 4.0 and 4.3 points, respectively. A change in 
      the total score of plus or minus 22 points is required to exceed the possible 
      range of measurement error, at a 0.80 confidence interval (CI). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Overall, the results of this study indicate that the clinician evaluating elderly 
      psychiatric inpatients should interpret a change in the total score of less than 
      22 points with caution, because it may be due to measurement error.

TI  - Apathy and executive function in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 373-81
AB  - Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in patients with Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD). Recent studies have linked the presence of apathy to alterations in frontal 
      lobe functions, but few studies have explored the relationship using standard 
      neuropsychological measures in patients with AD. We administered a comprehensive 
      battery of neuropsychological tests and a behavior rating scale to 80 patients 
      with AD. We explored the relationship of apathy to executive dysfunction. AD 
      patients with apathy performed significantly worse on tests of executive function 
      (WAIS-R Digit Symbol, Trail-Making, Stroop Color Interference Test) than AD 
      patients without apathy. The presence of dysphoria did not modify these results 
      and no significant relationships were found between tests of executive functions 
      and dysphoria. Performance on executive measures as a group were effective in 
      correctly classifying patients as apathetic or nonapathetic with 75% accuracy. 
      Neuropsychological measures not dependent on executive functions were unrelated 
      to apathy. Apathy is associated with executive dysfunction and not with other 
      neuropsychological deficits. Apathy is distinct from dysphoria.

TI  - Association between neuropsychiatric and autonomic dysfunction in Alzheimer's 
      disease.
PG  - 43-6
AB  - We sought to determine whether there was an association between specific 
      neuropsychiatric deficits and autonomic dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). We studied 20 patients and 20 age-matched control subjects with 
      neuropsychiatric tests (Blessed, Cornell depression and NPI scores) and autonomic 
      tests (Deep breath (HRdb), 30:15 ratio and orthostatic hypotension (Bpoh)). The 
      30:15 ratio was consistently reduced in AD patients as compared to control 
      subjects (1.05+/-0.07 for patients and 1.18+/-0.1 for controls, p 0.001). Whereas 
      there were no significant differences in the HRdb and presence of Bpoh. In AD 
      patients with an abnormal 30:15 ratio, there were significant abnormalities in 
      the Blessed score and in the apathy, delusions and aberrant motor behavior items 
      of the NPI. The other autonomic tests did not correlate with any neuropsychiatric 
      score. The relationship between abnormal cortical function and impaired 30:15 
      ratio suggested that a lack of cortical modulation of autonomic circuits may 
      underlie cardiovascular instability in these patients.

TI  - Use of the Chinese version of the Beck Depression Inventory for screening 
      depression in primary care.
PG  - 94-9
AB  - Many Asian-Americans are unfamiliar with depression and its treatment. When 
      depressed, they generally seek treatment from their primary care physicians and 
      complain about their physical symptoms, resulting in under-recognition and 
      under-treatment of depression. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the 
      Chinese version of the Beck Depression Inventory (CBDI) for screening depression 
      among Chinese-Americans in primary care. A total of 503 Chinese-Americans in the 
      primary care clinic of a community health center were administered the CBDI for 
      depression screening. Patients who screened positive (CBDI > or = 16) were 
      interviewed by a psychiatrist using the Structured Clinical Interview for 
      DSM-III-R, patient version (SCID-I/P) for confirmation of the diagnosis. Patients 
      who screened negative (CBDI < 16) were randomly selected to be interviewed using 
      the depression module of the SCID-I/P. The results of the SCID-I/P interview were 
      used as the standard for evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of the CBDI. 
      A total of 815 Chinese-Americans in a primary care clinic were approached, and 
      503 completed the CBDI. Seventy-six (15%) screened positive (CBDI > or = 16), and 
      the prevalence of major depression was 19.6% by using extrapolated results from 
      SCID-I/P interviews. When administered by a native-speaking research assistant, 
      the CBDI has good sensitivity (.79), specificity (.91), positive predictive value 
      (.79), and negative predictive value (.91). Despite the commonly believed 
      tendency to focus on physical symptoms rather than depressed mood, 
      Chinese-Americans are able to report symptoms of depression in response to a 
      questionnaire. The CBDI, when administered by research assistants, has good 
      sensitivity and specificity in recognizing major depression in this population. 
      Lack of interest among Chinese-American patients in using the CBDI as a 
      self-rating instrument has limited its use for depression screening in primary 
      care settings.

TI  - Snoezelen for dementia.
PG  - CD003152
LID - CD003152
AB  - BACKGROUND: Snoezelen, multi-sensory stimulation, provides sensory stimuli to 
      stimulate the primary senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell, through 
      the use of lighting effects, tactile surfaces, meditative music and the odour of 
      relaxing essential oils (Pinkney 1997). The clinical application of snoezelen has 
      been extended from the field of learning disability to dementia care over the 
      past decade. The rationale for its use lies in providing a sensory environment 
      that places fewer demands on intellectual abilities but capitalizes on the 
      residual sensorimotor abilities of people with dementia (e.g. Buettner 1999, Hope 
      1998). Practitioners are keen to use snoezelen in dementia care, and some 
      encouraging results have been documented in the area of promoting adaptive 
      behaviours (e.g. Baker, Long 1992, Spaull 1998). However, the clinical 
      application of snoezelen often varies in form, nature, principles and procedures. 
      Such variations not only make examination of the therapeutic values of Snoezelen 
      difficult, but also impede the clinical development of snoezelen in dementia 
      care. A systematic review of evidence for the efficacy of snoezelen in the care 
      of people with dementia is therefore needed to inform future clinical 
      applications and research directions. OBJECTIVES: This review aims to examine the 
      clinical efficacy of snoezelen for older people with dementia. SEARCH STRATEGY: 
      "Snoezelen", "multi-sensory", "dement*", "Alzheimer*", "randomized control/single 
      control/double control" were used as keywords to search seven electronic 
      databases (e.g. MEDLINE, PsyLIT). The list of trials was compared with those 
      identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and 
      Cognitive Improvement Group. SELECTION CRITERIA: All RCTs in which Snoezelen or 
      multi-sensory programmes were used as an intervention for people with dementia 
      were included in the review. Trial data included in the review were restricted to 
      those involving people aged over 60 years suffering from any type of dementia, 
      except one subject of Baker's study was aged below 60 years. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: Only two RCTs fulfill the inclusion criteria for this systematic 
      review. Two reviewers independently extracted the data from these two inclusion 
      studies. Quantitative synthesis of the comparable data from the two trials was 
      performed. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials were included. Both Baker (and Kragt examined 
      the short-term values of snoezelen on the behaviours of people with dementia. 
      Although the pooled results were insignificant, the trend was in the direction of 
      favouring treatment (hence a negative value of the SMD). The standardized mean 
      difference (SMD) was -1.22, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) (-4.08, 1.64). 
      Kragt's result, weighted 47%, was significant in favour of treatment, with a SMD 
      of -2.77 and a 95% CI (-4.24, -1.29). During the snoezelen session, Kragt's 
      subjects presented significantly fewer apathetic behaviours (t=-8.22, p<0.01), 
      fewer restless behaviours (t=-3.00, p=0.01), fewer repetitive behaviours 
      (t=-.822, p<0.01), and fewer disturbances (t=-4.91, p<0.01). Baker's result was 
      slightly not in favour of the treatment, with a SMD of 0.16 and a 95% CI (-0.41, 
      0.73). The control subjects touched objects/equipment more appropriately within 
      the activity sessions than the subjects who participated in snoezelen sessions 
      (F(1,47)=5.96, p=.001). Kragt did not examine the carryover and long-term effects 
      of snoezelen, so only Baker's results were analysed. Baker used the Behavioural 
      and Mood Disturbance scale (BMD), the REHAB, the CAPE and MMSE to assess patients 
      mood, behaviour and cognition after (but not immediately after) four treatment 
      sessions and eight treatment sessions. Some assessments were carried at home, 
      some at day hospital. There were many subscores and mostly there were no 
      differences between treatment and control. The following significant differences 
      were found with benefit in favour of snoezelen compared with control after four 
      sessions: apathy ezelen compared with control after four sessions: apathy score 
      of the BRS (CAPE) (MD -3.00, 95%CIs -5.87 to -0.13, P=0.04), after eight 
      sessions: mood score of the BRS (CAPE) (MD -2.60, 95%CIs -4.92 to -0.28, P=0.03), 
      total score of the BRS (CAPE) (MD -6.92, 95%CIs -13.13 to -0.7, P=0.03), speech 
      skills of the REHAB (MD 1.46, 95%CIs 0.01 to 2.82, P=0.03), psychomotor subscore 
      of the cognitive assessment scale of CAPE (MD -3.12, 95%CIs -5.31 to -0.93, 
      P<0.01). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Two trials were reviewed. Although both studies 
      examined the short-term values of snoezelen on people with dementia, it is not 
      feasible to draw a firm conclusion at this stage, for two main reasons. Firstly, 
      very limited data were available for analysis, thus limiting data inference and 
      generalization. Secondly, different methodology and control conditions were 
      adopted in the two trials. Such variations not only require a careful 
      interpretation of results but also make the comparison of results across studies 
      less valid. Hence, there is an urgent need for more systematic and scientific 
      research studies to examine the clinical value of snoezelen for people with 
      dementia. To our knowledge, there are four RCTs currently in progress. It is 
      hoped that the data and results of these trials will enrich the systematic review 
      of snoezelen for dementia in the next update.

TI  - Development and Preliminary Validation of an Athlete Burnout Measure.
PG  - 281-306
LID - 10.1123/jsep.23.4.281 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this research was to develop a psychometrically sound measure of 
      athlete burnout. In Study 1, exploratory factor analysis revealed burn-out 
      dimensions reflective of emotional/physical exhaustion, reduced sense of swimming 
      accomplishment, and swimming devaluation. In two subsequent studies, the 
      psychometric properties of a refined version of this measure were examined. 
      Independent samples of senior age-group swimmers and college athletes from a 
      variety of sports completed a questionnaire that tapped the three burnout 
      dimensions as well as stress- and motivation-related variables. Confirmatory 
      factor analysis and alternative model testing supported the specified 
      three-factor burnout model. In support of construct validity, the burnout 
      subscales correlated positively with stress, trait anxiety, and amotivation, and 
      correlated negatively with coping, social support, enjoyment, commitment, and 
      intrinsic motivation indices across the two studies.

TI  - Neuropsychiatric assessment of Gilles de la Tourette patients: comparative study 
      with other hyperkinetic and hypokinetic movement disorders.
PG  - 1098-104
AB  - The role of the basal ganglia in conditions with co-occurring movement disorders 
      and neuropsychiatric symptoms is not well known. It has been hypothesized that 
      hyperkinesia -disinhibited behaviors and hypokinesia-inhibited behaviors result 
      from an imbalance between the direct and indirect striatal output pathways, and 
      that differential involvement of these pathways could account for the concurrent 
      abnormalities in movement and behavior observed in these disorders. This study 
      aimed to evaluate whether the pattern and the extent of the neuropsychiatric 
      manifestations of patients with GTS, a hyperkinetic movement disorder of basal 
      ganglia origin, differs from that of patients with other basal ganglia 
      hyperkinetic (e.g., HD) or hypokinetic (e.g., PSP) movement disorders, and to 
      determine whether patients with GTS show a greater frequency of hyperactive 
      behaviors (e.g., agitation, irritability, euphoria, or anxiety) than PSP 
      patients, and are comparable to patients with HD. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
      (NPI), a scale with established validity and reliability, was administered to 26 
      patients with GTS (mean age, 30.2 +/- 2.2 years), and the results were compared 
      with that of 29 patients with HD (mean age, 43.8 +/- 2 years) and 34 with PSP 
      (mean +/- S.D. age, 66.6 +/- 1.2 years). There was no difference between the 
      groups in the total NPI scores. However, there was a double dissociation in 
      behaviors: patients with hyperkinetic disorders (HD and GTS) exhibited 
      significantly more agitation, irritability, anxiety, euphoria, and hyperkinesia, 
      whereas hypokinetic patients (PSP) exhibited more apathy. Patients with GTS 
      showed greater scores than HD patients in all those scores differentiating HD and 
      GTS from PSP patients (e.g., agitation, irritability, anxiety and euphoria), and 
      were differentiated in a logistic regression analysis from both HD and PSP 
      patients in having significantly more anxiety. We found that patients with GTS 
      manifested predominantly hyperactive behaviors similar but more pronounced than 
      those presented by patients with HD, while those with PSP manifested hypoactive 
      behaviors. Based on our findings and the proposed models of basal ganglia 
      dysfunction in these disorders, we suggest that the hyperactive behaviors in GTS 
      are comparable to those observed in HD, being both secondary to an excitatory 
      subcortical output through the medial and orbitofrontal cortical circuits, while 
      in PSP the hypoactive behaviors are secondary to hypostimulation of these 
      circuits. Abnormalities of other brain structures (e.g., amygdala, brainstem 
      nuclei) may account for the significantly higher anxiety scores differentiating 
      GTS from HD patients.

TI  - Behavioral changes in Huntington Disease.
PG  - 219-26
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to gain a better understanding of behavioral 
      abnormalities in Huntington disease (HD) and to develop a method for reliably 
      assessing these changes. BACKGROUND: Behavioral changes are a central feature of 
      HD and often cause considerable distress and difficulty to patients and their 
      relatives. However, they have received little attention from research despite 
      their prevalence and clinical significance. METHODS: One hundred thirty-four 
      patients with HD were assessed using the Problem Behaviors Assessment for 
      Huntington Disease (PBA-HD), an instrument for rating the presence, severity and 
      frequency of behavioral abnormalities in HD. RESULTS: The findings confirm that 
      behavioral problems are common among patients with HD. The most common symptoms 
      were loss of energy and initiative, poor perseverance and quality of work, 
      impaired judgment, poor self-care and emotional blunting. Affective symptoms such 
      as depression, anxiety and irritability occurred in around half the patients 
      studied. Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) were rarely reported. 
      Factor analysis distinguished three clusters of behavioral symptoms, which were 
      interpreted respectively as reflecting Apathy, Depression and Irritability. The 
      'Apathy' factor was highly correlated with duration of illness, whereas no such 
      relationship was observed for the 'Depression' and 'Irritability' factors. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that certain behavioral changes are fundamental 
      to the progression of HD, whereas others have a more complex relationship to the 
      disease process. The findings have implications for the choice of behavioral 
      measures used to evaluate efficacy of therapeutic interventions.

TI  - A fall prevention program for the home environment.
PG  - 157-63
AB  - Falls are the leading cause of injury, death, and disability among people older 
      than 65. When elders fall, they sustain such injuries as hip, spine, hand, and/or 
      pelvic fractures. The prognosis after such a fall is poor--only half of older 
      adults hospitalized for hip fractures are able to return home or live 
      independently again. Even without injury, falls cause a loss of confidence that 
      results in reduced physical activity, increased dependency, and social 
      withdrawal. As a home care agency dealing with a geriatric population, our goal 
      was to develop a user-friendly fall prevention program that would promote 
      multidisciplinary assessment and intervention. We have developed a preventive 
      approach through which clinicians and patients can collaborate on preventing 
      falls in the home and maintaining our patients' first priority: quality of life.

      with senile dementia of Alzheimer-type, the MMS score is inversely correlated 
      with apathy and depression. The aim of this study is to build a scale aimed at 
      loss of motivation and validated for elderly people. METHODS: The study was 
      performed on 44 non-demented elderly people, 54 outpatients with dementia, mainly 
      Alzheimer's type. After agreement of the patients and the family, patients were 
      assessed using different scales: Cornell's for depression, Marin's for apathy, 
      MMS for cognitive disorders. At the same time, we tested with caregivers a 21 
      items indirect scale listing various disorders related to loss of motivation, 
      scored from 1 to 4: very often, often, sometimes, never. Patients were retested 
      by 7 different caregivers, and different investigators, immediately and a month 
      later to evaluate reproducibility, temporal stability using Cohen's Kappa and 
      Spearman coefficients. The demotivation scale was then correlated with the other 
      scales and Cronbach's alpha coefficient was studied. RESULTS: The 44 non-demented 
      people were 80.25 years old +/- 7.75. 54 demented patients were included: 15 men 
      and 39 women. The mean age was 81.47 years +/- 8.03. As Cohen's Kappa and 
      Spearman coefficients were not sufficient for 6 items, the scale was reduced to 
      15 items (Presented). The depression scale is strongly and significantly 
      correlated with the Marin's apathy scale. Internal coherence is particularly 
      significant: Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.91. For the 54 patients with 
      dementia, the depression score worsens significantly as cognitive disorders 
      worsen. In these patients Marin's scale shows a progression of apathy with the 
      impairment observed in MMS, but the MMS is not correlated with the score at the 
      demotivation scale. So this latter scale seems to measure something close but 
      independent from apathy. DISCUSSION: The loss of motivation is a frequent 
      behavioral disorder in old patients. Loss of motivation can be present in any 
      chronic disease with asthenia. This disorder is frequent in depression, in 
      dementia and even in endocrine disease, for instance hyperthyroidism. It triggers 
      a loss of commitment of old people and paves the way for the loss of autonomy. 
      Apathy is a loss of motivation associated with an affective blunting. 
      Demotivation is congruent with the actual presence of apathy in patients as 
      measured using Marin's scale that has been used as a standard in this study. This 
      paper presents a methodology for an evaluation scale aimed at the loss of 
      motivation in old people. A psychologist and seven different caregivers working 
      in a day care hospital on 98 patients performed an indirect assessment. An 
      estimation of specificity, sensibility, reproducibility and homogeneity was 
      tested with appropriate techniques. The results obtained with this scale answer 
      the preliminary methodological queries, allowing us to trigger further researches 
      for a final validation. According to our results, demotivation does not increase 
      with age neither in demented nor in non-demented patients. Conversely, the 
      aggravation of cognitive disorders in dementia is associated with increasing 
      demotivation and depression. The loss of motivation participates to the learnt 
      and acquired helplessness. Its care is necessarily global, using pharmacological, 
      psychological and sociotherapeutic treatment. CONCLUSION: EAD scale appears a 
      reliable tool to assess loss of motivation in old and very old patients.

TI  - Dimensions of fatigue during radiotherapy. An application of the Multidimensional 
      Fatigue Inventory.
PG  - 355-60
AB  - The aim of the present study was to describe fatigue in a group of irradiated 
      cancer patients. Fatigue was assessed prospectively in 81 Swedish cancer 
      patients, using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), which was also 
      validated in the study, the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and a Borg CR10 scale 
      before curative radiotherapy, at the end of therapy and 1 and 3 months after 
      treatment. The mean age of these patients was 56 years; 90% were female; and 65% 
      were being treated for cancer of the breast. The absorbed radiation dose was 50 
      Gy or lower in 90% of the patients. A clear peak in experienced fatigue according 
      to the three scales was seen at the end of treatment. In the MFI-20 the 
      dimensions of General fatigue, Physical fatigue and Reduced activity, were more 
      pronounced than the aspects of Mental fatigue and Reduced motivation. Comparison 
      with other studies using the same instrument in other irradiated patients 
      revealed a similar pattern. The internal consistency of the Swedish version of 
      the MFI-20 was good. The MFI-20 is shown to be a valid instrument for assessing 
      fatigue in patients undergoing radiotherapy.

TI  - Neuropsychiatric differences between Parkinson's disease with dementia and 
      Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 184-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the profile of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with 
      Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and patients with Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of a population-based sample of patients 
      with PDD and AD patients matched for age, sex, and Mini-Mental State Examination 
      (MMSE) score. METHOD: Patients were diagnosed according to published criteria for 
      PD and AD. The diagnosis of dementia in PD was made according to DSM-III-R, and 
      was based on clinical interview of the patient and a relative, psychometric 
      testing (including MMSE, Dementia Rating Scale and tests assessing memory, 
      executive functions and visuospatial functioning) and physical examination. The 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was administered to all patients. RESULTS: One 
      or more psychiatric symptoms was reported in 95% of AD and 83% of PDD patients. 
      Hallucinations were more severe in PD patients, while aberrant motor behavior, 
      agitation, disinhibition, irritability, euphoria, and apathy were more severe in 
      AD. In PDD, apathy was more common in mild Hoehn and Yahr stages, while delusions 
      increased with more severe motor and cognitive disturbances. In PDD, only 
      delusions correlated with the MMSE score. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms 
      are common and severe in patients with PDD, with important implications for the 
      management of these patients. AD and PDD patients have different neuropsychiatric 
      profiles, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Cognitive impairment, 
      psychopathology, and motor features progress independently in PDD patients

TI  - Peripheral neuropathic pain--a multidimensional burden for patients.
PG  - 379-89
AB  - The present study was undertaken to assess the health-related quality of life 
      (HRQoL) and burden of illness due to pain and its treatment for patients with 
      peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP). It is the first step in finding reliable 
      instruments/targets to evaluate treatment outcome in this patient population. 
      Study population consisted of 126 patients suffering from neuropathic pain due to 
      a peripheral nerve or root lesion, recruited from two multidisciplinary pain 
      clinics. HRQoL was examined using Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey and 
      Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). Pain intensity in four categories (at rest and 
      evoked by movement, touch and cold) was rated on a visual analogue scale (VAS). 
      Degree of discomfort from pain and 25 symptoms related to pain and side-effects 
      was also assessed. Reduction in workload due to pain was recorded, as was the 
      pain relief from previous and current treatments and the reasons for 
      discontinuing previous treatments. All dimensions in SF-36 and NHP were 
      significantly impaired. SF-36 was a valid instrument for describing the impact of 
      pain on the HRQoL of patients with PNP. NHP had a lower reliability but has other 
      advantages that might be of importance. Many patients experienced poor pain 
      relief from ongoing pain treatments. Most previous treatments were discontinued 
      owing to lack of efficacy and/or severe side-effects. Many patients experienced a 
      high intensity of at least one type of pain; median VAS for the highest pain 
      intensity score of each patient (any type of pain) was 74/100. Besides pain, 
      patients were most bothered by difficulty in sleeping, lack of energy, 
      drowsiness, difficulty in concentrating and dry mouth. Employment status was 
      reduced owing to pain in 52% of the patients. The intense pain, other troublesome 
      symptoms, limited efficacy and tolerability of available treatments, together 
      with the impaired health and reduced work status, amount to a substantial burden 
      for patients with PNP.

TI  - The Korean version of the neuropsychiatric inventory: a scoring tool for 
      neuropsychiatric disturbance in dementia patients.
PG  - 609-15
AB  - The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) is a standardized, validated, and reliable 
      tool to assess neuropsychiatric derangements in dementia patients. The aim of 
      this study is to develop the Korean version of the NPI (K-NPI) and to test its 
      reliability and usefulness in dementia patients. The subjects were 49 normal 
      controls and 92 patients with Alzheimer's disease (43), vascular dementia (32), 
      frontotemporal lobar degeneration (11), and other causes (6). Their caregivers 
      familiar with the subjects' everyday behavior were interviewed with the K-NPI. In 
      a subgroup (29/141) of the caregivers, the K-NPI was repeated for test-retest 
      reliability, average of 23.1 days after the initial test. Prevalence rates of 12 
      behavioral domains in dementia patients were comparable to those of the original 
      NPI; apathy was the most common and hallucination was the least common behavior. 
      Total K-NPI scores correlated positively with dementia severity assessed with the 
      Korean Mini-Mental State Examination. Test-retest reliabilities of frequencies 
      and severities of all subscales were significantly high. Depression, anxiety, 
      apathy, irritability, night-time behavior, and eating change were identified at 
      very low rates in normal controls and were significantly less than those in 
      dementia patients (p<0.001). The K-NPI, whose reliability and competency are 
      comparable to those of the original version, may be a reliable and useful tool 
      for measuring neuropsychiatric disturbances in Korean dementia patients.

TI  - The Geriatric Pain Measure: validity, reliability and factor analysis.
PG  - 1669-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain is a multidimensional experience that should be evaluated beyond 
      an estimate of intensity. A multidimensional pain measure has not been developed 
      for older persons undergoing comprehensive geriatric assessment. OBJECTIVE: To 
      develop and evaluate validity and reliability of a multidimensional pain 
      assessment instrument for older persons. RESEARCH DESIGN: A series of steps in 
      instrument development and evaluation. SUBJECTS: A total of 176 subjects (mean 
      age 84 +/- 6.0 years) in ambulatory geriatric clinics; 64% were women, and 73% 
      had a history of chronic pain. MEASUREMENTS: Measurements included the Geriatric 
      Pain Measure (GPM), the McGill Pain Questionnaire, Yesavage GDS, Katz ADLs, 
      Lawton IADLs, Tinetti Gait and Balance, Folstein MMSE, and other demographic and 
      clinical characteristics from interview and chart review. RESULTS: The GPM 
      demonstrated a standardized alpha = 0.9445, homogeneity ratio =0.457, and average 
      inter-item correlation =0.415. A subgroup of 50 subjects demonstrated concurrent 
      validity of the GPM in comparison with the McGill Pain Questionnaire (Pearson's r 
      correlation 0.6269 (P < .0000). Test-retest reliability was demonstrated in 
      another subgroup of 50 subjects who repeated the GPM within 48 to 72 hours 
      (Pearson's r = 0.9018; P < .0000). Factor analysis revealed five clusters of 
      components: Pain Intensity, Disengagement, Pain with Ambulation, Pain with 
      Strenuous Activities, and Pain with Other Activities. CONCLUSIONS: The GPM is a 
      24-item questionnaire that is easy to administer and has significant validity and 
      reliability in older persons with multiple medical problems. The GPM may be a 
      useful addition to the multidimensional geriatric assessment process.

TI  - Hosting a wellness day: promoting health in the old-old.
PG  - 326-35
AB  - The purpose of health promotion and disease prevention is to increase the number 
      of years of life and ensure better quality of remaining life. Those in the oldest 
      age group (> or = 90 years) are generally less likely to monitor their 
      cholesterol intake, exercise, have their stools checked for occult blood, or 
      undergo a mammogram, Papanicolaou test, or prostate or skin evaluation as 
      recommended. The most common reasons given for not engaging in these activities 
      are advanced age, absence of direction by primary health care providers, and lack 
      of interest in following up abnormal findings. To promote primary and secondary 
      disease prevention and health promotion, a Wellness Day was hosted in a 
      continuing-care retirement community by the in-house geriatric nurse practitioner 
      and a group of nurse practitioner students. The program offered cancer screening, 
      cardiovascular health assessments, and exercise prescreening and education, as 
      well as screening for diabetes and risk for osteoporosis. An individualized 
      approach to health promotion was used, reviewing with each resident the pros and 
      cons of participating in each of these behaviors.

TI  - Dementia with lewy bodies: findings from an international multicentre study.
PG  - 1034-45
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the baseline demographic, neuropsychiatric and 
      neurological data of a large selected clinical sample of patients with dementia 
      with Lewy Bodies (DLB) from an international multicentre trial with rivastigmine. 
      To examine the usefulness of the Consensus Criteria for the diagnosis of DLB in 
      different countries. METHODS: Seventeen centres from Spain, the UK and Italy 
      recruited patients diagnosed clinically as probable DLB according to recent 
      Consensus Criteria (McKeith et al., 1996). A standard clinical protocol including 
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, collection of demographic and medical data, 
      cognitive (Mini Mental State Examination: MMSE), motor (Unified Parkinson's 
      Disease Rating Scale: UPDRS) and neuropsychiatric (Neuropsychiatric Inventory: 
      NPI) examinations, was applied after obtaining informed consent. Data were 
      summarised and compared across countries with uni- and multivariate analyses. 
      RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients were recruited: 56.7% males, mean (SD) 
      age 73.9 (6.4) years, range 57 - 87 years. Sixty percent fulfilled all three core 
      diagnostic features of DLB, and 40% only two ('parkinsonism' 92.4%, 'cognitive 
      fluctuations' 89.1%, 'visual hallucinations' 77.3%). 'Systematised delusions' 
      (46%) and 'repeated falls' (42%) were the most frequent supportive diagnostic 
      features. There were no differences across countries in demographic, diagnostic 
      or clinical features. Patients showed a wide range of psychopathology which was 
      weakly correlated with cognitive impairment. Some mild extrapyramidal signs (EPS) 
      were observed in most patients. CONCLUSIONS: The Consensus Criteria for DLB can 
      be consistently applied across many different sites for multicentre studies. 
      'Parkinsonism' and 'cognitive fluctuations' as core features and 'systematised 
      delusions' and 'repeated falls' as supportive features are the most frequent 
      diagnostic clues. Neuropsychiatric disturbances, in particular apathy, delusions, 
      hallucinations and anxiety, and mild symmetric EPS are frequent in DLB and are 
      only related weakly to cognitive impairment.

TI  - Psychological constructs associated with emotional blood pressure response and 
      white coat phenomenon.
PG  - 250-4
AB  - Some hypertensive and non-hypertensive subjects have a striking blood pressure 
      response to a medical environment (white coat phenomenon), although it is 
      unlikely that its presence, degree, and duration can be routinely predicted. 
      Despite the common observation that "anxious" patients may present with this 
      reaction when a physician measures their blood pressure, no psychological 
      variables have thus far been linked to white coat phenomenon in formal analyses. 
      Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a useful tool to disclose the phenomenon 
      since it allows precise evaluation of repeated blood pressure measurements 
      outside the medical environment. To investigate the possible relationship between 
      psychological profile and white coat phenomenon, we have planned to administer a 
      series of psychometric tests to 120 subjects undergoing ambulatory blood pressure 
      monitoring. The present data are derived from an analysis of the first set of 70 
      patients. Thirty-four subjects who presented with white coat phenomenon (defined 
      as office blood pressure elevated by at least 15% over the mean 24-hour 
      ambulatory blood pressure value) and 36 comparable subjects who did not have this 
      reaction underwent a series of psychometric tests evaluating cognitive behavior, 
      hostility, cynicism, anger, anxiety state, coping ability and strategies, and 
      quality of life. Of the various psychometric tests, the scores of three relevant 
      scales (healthcare-related fears, mental efficiency and behavioral disengagement) 
      were significantly higher in the group of patients with white coat phenomenon, 
      while in both groups, emotional instability was higher than the clinical cut-off 
      point. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding 
      signs and repression of anger (anger-out and anger-in), cynicism, hostility, or 
      anxiety state. Our data seem to indicate that the subjects most likely to show an 
      overt blood pressure increase in the medical environment are those who evidence 
      healthcare-related fears and emotional instability but are not necessarily 
      anxious. They exhibit high coping skills in cognitive resolution of stressing 
      situations (such as blood pressure measurement) but do not combine these 
      strategies with an adequate behavioral response and do not feel that behavioral 
      involvement is necessary for the management of their clinical condition.

TI  - The nature of the depressive symptomatology preceding myocardial infarction.
PG  - 86-9
AB  - Little is known about the nature of the depressive symptomatology preceding 
      myocardial infarction (MI). Specification of the depressive symptomatology is 
      important for the development of hypotheses about the biological mechanisms 
      relating depressive symptoms to MI. To test the hypothesis that feelings of 
      fatigue and loss of energy have the strongest predictive power of all depressive 
      symptoms, the authors reanalyzed data from a prospective study of 3877 healthy 
      men aged 40 to 65 years. The men's mental state was assessed using the Maastricht 
      Questionnaire, a scale that measures vital exhaustion, which is characterized by 
      unusual fatigue and lack of energy, increased irritability, and depressive 
      symptoms, including demoralization. Oblique factor analysis was used to validate 
      these dimensions. Results of Cox's regression analyses showed that the fatigue 
      subscale has the strongest predictive power for incident MI and that depression 
      and irritability subscales lose their predictive power when controlled for 
      fatigue.

TI  - The Frontal Behavioral Inventory in the differential diagnosis of frontotemporal 
      dementia.
PG  - 460-8
AB  - A personality and behavioral disorder is an important and defining feature of 
      frontal lobe dementia (FLD) or frontotemporal degeneration (FTD). The diagnosis 
      usually depends on the progressive development of various behavioral symptoms 
      rather than a set of neuropsychological measures. Quantification of the 
      personality-behavior disorder is important for standardizing the diagnosis. An 
      inventory was constructed to capture the major positive and negative behaviors 
      and personality change, and it was administered prospectively to caregivers of 
      108 patients in a cognitive neurology clinic, at the time of first diagnostic 
      assessment. The prevalence and extent of behavioral abnormality was quantitated 
      in the clinic population of FLD, vascular dementia (VaD), Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD), primary progressive aphasia (PPA), and depressive disorder (DD) patients. 
      The mean scores of FLD patients were significantly above all other groups. Scores 
      in VaD were also higher than in AD, PPA, and DD. Interrater reliability (Cohen's 
      kappa of .90) and item consistency (a Cronbach alpha of .89) were both high. 
      Perseveration, indifference, inattention, inappropriateness, and loss of insight 
      rated highest in FLD, significantly different from all other groups. Apathy, 
      aspontaneity, inflexibility, disorganization, impulsivity, personal neglect, and 
      poor judgment were also significantly higher in FLD. Discriminant function 
      correctly classified 92.7% versus all other patients (NON-FLD) in the study. A 
      total of 18.8% of VaD patients were misclassified as FLD. Indifference, alien 
      hand, and inappropriateness were the highest discriminant functions. 
      Perseveration and verbal apraxia were important discriminatory items for FLD and 
      PPA, respectively. The FBI is a standardized behavioral inventory useful to 
      diagnose FLD, to differentiate it from other dementias, and to quantify the 
      behavior disorder.

TI  - Mental and behavioral disturbances in dementia: findings from the Cache County 
      Study on Memory in Aging.
PG  - 708-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors report findings from a study of 5,092 community residents 
      who constituted 90% of the elderly resident population of Cache County, Utah. 
      METHOD: The 5,092 participants, who were 65 years old or older, were screened for 
      dementia. Based on the results of this screen, 1,002 participants (329 with 
      dementia and 673 without dementia) underwent comprehensive neuropsychiatric 
      examinations and were rated on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, a widely used 
      method for ascertainment and classification of dementia-associated mental and 
      behavioral disturbances. RESULTS: Of the 329 participants with dementia, 214 
      (65%) had Alzheimer's disease, 62 (19%) had vascular dementia, and 53 (16%) had 
      another DSM-IV dementia diagnosis; 201 (61%) had exhibited one or more mental or 
      behavioral disturbances in the past month. Apathy (27%), depression (24%), and 
      agitation/aggression (24%) were the most common in participants with dementia. 
      These disturbances were almost four times more common in participants with 
      dementia than in those without. Only modest differences were observed in the 
      prevalence of mental or behavioral disturbances in different types of dementia or 
      at different stages of illness: participants with Alzheimer's disease were more 
      likely to have delusions and less likely to have depression. Agitation/aggression 
      and aberrant motor behavior were more common in participants with advanced 
      dementia. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of their findings in this large community 
      population of elderly people, the authors conclude that a wide range of 
      dementia-associated mental and behavioral disturbances afflict the majority of 
      individuals with dementia. Because of their frequency and their adverse effects 
      on patients and their caregivers, these disturbances should be ascertained and 
      treated in all cases of dementia.

TI  - Coping, mood, and aspects of personality in Spanish translation and evidence of 
      convergence with English versions.
PG  - 63-87
AB  - Research on stress and its influence on health and well-being has flourished for 
      several decades, examining as predictors such psychosocial variables as 
      personality and coping. This work now often targets multiethnic samples. Because 
      many potential participants lack facility in English, a need exists for 
      translations of measures into other languages. We translated 6 instruments into 
      Spanish and studied their characteristics. Of these, 3 were measures of 
      personality qualities: the Life Orientation Test--Revised (Scheier, Carver, & 
      Bridges, 1994), the Behavioral Inhibition/Behavioral Activation Scales (Carver & 
      White, 1994), and the Measure of Body Apperception (Carver et al., 1998). The

TI  - Outcomes of trauma patients who survive prolonged lengths of stay in the 
      intensive care unit.
PG  - 229-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine a subgroup of severely injured patients spending > or = 3 
      weeks in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to determine their disposition and 
      eventual functional outcome. METHODS: A retrospective review of our trauma 
      registry and medical records over a 7-year period (January of 1991 to December of 
      1997) identified 115 patients with ICU length of stay (LOS) > or = 3 weeks. 
      Variables selected included age, length of stay, injury severity score, injuries, 
      disposition, and charges. Functional independence measures (FIM) were obtained in 
      patients requiring inpatient rehabilitation and a written questionnaire (Rand 
      36-item Health Survey) was mailed to all patients alive at discharge. RESULTS: 
      Mean ICU length of stay of the 115 patients was 36 days (range, 21-106 days); 
      mean age, 49 years (range, 4-89 years); 73 patients (63%) were males, 42 patients 
      (37%) were females. Overall mortality was 22% (n = 25). The remaining 90 patients 
      survived to discharge with the following disposition: rehabilitation facility 60% 
      (n = 54), home with temporary disability 22% (n = 20), nursing home 8% (n = 7), 
      home with permanent disability 4% (n = 4), transferred 6% (n = 5). Mean hospital 
      charge was $193,000 (range, $77,000-$528,000). No variable or combination could 
      predict outcome except age. Elderly patients (age > or = 75, n = 24) had an 
      overall mortality of 42% (n = 10). Eight of 14 survivors fulfilled admission 
      criteria and entered our rehabilitation facility. The remaining six elderly 
      patients either went to nursing homes or were permanently disabled. Complete FIM 
      scores were available on 47 of 54 patients who went to rehabilitation facility. 
      The mean rehabilitation facility admission FIM score was 52, indicating either 
      complete dependence or the need for moderate assistance. After they had remained 
      at the rehabilitation facility for a mean of 48 days (range, 7-278 days), 
      patients' FIM scores improved to a mean of 86, signifying minimal contact 
      assistance or supervision only. Three-month follow-up FIM scores continued to 
      improve to a mean of 101, a score denoting complete independence. Elderly 
      patients within the rehabilitation facility fared as well as the younger group. 
      For the Rand-36 survey, 47 of 90 patients or family members were contacted. 
      Twelve patients died since discharge, leaving 35 patients to complete the survey. 
      Despite excellent FIM scores, overall mean health was only fair to good, with 
      limitations to activity and lack of energy cited as the main problems. 
      CONCLUSION: Despite tremendous resource utilization, the majority of trauma 
      patients with prolonged ICU stays can eventually return to varying degrees of 
      functional daily living and independence, but not to preinjury levels. A subgroup 
      of severely injured elderly patients had a significantly higher mortality rate. 
      However, elderly survivors that entered our rehabilitation facility fared as well 
      as the younger patients.

TI  - Distress attributed to negative symptoms in schizophrenia.
PG  - 737-44
AB  - The purpose of the study was to examine (1) to which negative symptoms 
      schizophrenia patients attribute distress and (2) whether clinical variables can 
      predict the levels of reported distress. With the help of a research assistant, 
      86 hospitalized patients completed a self-rating scale for negative symptoms. The 
      21 items of the self-rating scale were taken from the Scale for the Assessment of 
      Negative Symptoms (SANS). A psychiatrist rated the patients on a number of 
      scales, including the SANS. When patients reported particular symptoms, they were 
      asked whether those symptoms bothered or distressed them. Answers to this 
      question were highly dependent on the type of symptom involved. Distress was most 
      often attributed to symptoms in the subscale avolition-apathy. Patients were also 
      asked how much they were bothered or distressed. Again, high levels of distress 
      were most often attributed to items in the subscale avolition-apathy. A summary 
      score was developed for the level of reported distress: the distress score. 
      Regression analysis showed that distress scores were not associated with the 
      observed severity of negative symptoms or with the level of psychiatric 
      disability. High distress scores were best predicted by the combination of high 
      scores for depression and high scores for insight into positive symptomatology. 
      However, this model explained only a quarter of the variance in distress scores.

TI  - The use of the neuropsychiatric inventory in nursing home residents. 
      Characterization and measurement.
PG  - 75-83
AB  - The authors assessed the validity of the nursing home version of the 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home Version (NPI-NH), comparing the responses 
      of certified nurses' aides (CNAs) and licensed vocational nurses (LVNs) with 
      research observations. Correlations were significant but moderate for all of the 
      domains of the NPI-NH (delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, 
      depression, apathy, disinhibition, euphoria, irritability/lability, and aberrant 
      motor disturbances) except anxiety and appetite disturbance. The LVNs' ratings 
      showed consistently higher correlations with the researchers' behavioral 
      observations than did the CNAs', but were moderate and generally better for 
      residents with high levels of neuropsychiatric symptoms, thus, caution should be 
      used with any untrained rater in the nursing home setting. The NPI-NH used by 
      non-research staff can be useful in identifying residents with significant 
      neuropsychiatric disturbances, but may be limited as an instrument for tracking 
      behavioral changes.

TI  - The interrelations between psychosis, behavioral disturbance, and depression in 
      Alzheimer disease.
PG  - S3-8
AB  - Behavioral changes are common in Alzheimer disease (AD), and heterogeneous in 
      their presentation. Subtle personality changes tend to occur early; these include 
      apathy, irritability and inability to pay attention. Later agitation, aggression 
      and disinhibited behaviors may appear. We have utilized the Columbia University 
      Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer's Disease to monitor a number of 
      behavioral symptoms in 235 patients with early probable AD. Markov analyses were 
      used to predict the probability of developing or retaining a given symptom at 
      6-month follow-up. The results show that the symptoms of psychopathology in AD 
      fluctuate with time. Agitation was both the most frequent and persistent symptom, 
      while paranoid delusions and hallucinations were less persistent. Most behavioral 
      disturbances, except paranoid delusions, were associated with greater cognitive 
      impairment. There was no association between depressive features and either 
      cognitive or functional impairment. These results have important implications for 
      the optimal treatment of the psychopathological symptoms of AD.

TI  - The spectrum of behavioral responses to cholinesterase inhibitor therapy in 
      Alzheimer disease.
PG  - 1388-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioral abnormalities are common in Alzheimer disease (AD); 
      cholinergic treatment reduces the behavioral disturbances of some patients with 
      AD. Characterizing the pretreatment profile of patients who are likely to respond 
      to cholinergic therapy will aid the efficient use of clinical resources. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the baseline behavioral profile for 86 patients with AD 
      treated with the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil hydrochloride. METHODS: 
      Open-label retrospective study of treatment-related behavioral assessments. Based 
      on previous double-blind placebo-controlled experience using the Neuropsychiatric 
      Inventory (NPI), patients were divided into responder (> or =4-point total NPI 
      score decrease, indicating improvement), unchanged (+/-3-point total NPI score 
      change), or nonresponder (> or =4-point total NPI score increase, indicating 
      worsening) groups. The Mini-Mental State Examination assessed cognitive response. 
      RESULTS: Behavioral improvement was seen in 35 patients (41%), worsening in 24 
      (28%), and no change in 27 (31%). Comparison of profiles in behavioral responders 
      vs nonresponders revealed significantly worse delusions (P = .04), agitation (P = 
      .04), depression (P = .006), anxiety (P = .02), apathy (P = .003), disinhibition 
      (P = .02), and irritability (P<.001) at baseline in responders. Five behaviors 
      changed significantly from baseline, improving for the responders and worsening 
      for the nonresponders: delusions (P = .003 for nonresponders, P = .004 for 
      responders), agitation (P = .01), anxiety (P = .006 for nonresponders, P = .004 
      for responders), disinhibition (P = .02 for nonresponders, P = .05 for 
      responders), and irritability (P = .003 for nonresponders, P = .001 for 
      responders). The behavioral changes were dose dependent. Cognition did not change 
      significantly with donepezil treatment within any group. CONCLUSIONS: Donepezil 
      has psychotropic properties, and pretreatment behaviors help predict patients' 
      responses to treatment.

TI  - Quality of life assessment in MND: development of a social withdrawal scale.
PG  - 26-34
AB  - A scale to measure 'social withdrawal,' was developed specifically for use with 
      MND patients. Scale design was based upon patient-focused interviews which were 
      used to explore patients' concerns. The impact the condition had upon their 
      social interactions with others was salient for all patients and affected their 
      overall quality of life. Using issues raised by patients, a 23-item scale was 
      generated to specifically and quantitatively measure social withdrawal and this 
      scale was psychometrically evaluated. The scale was administered to a sample of 
      23 patients at varied stages of progression of MND, and to a control group of 
      patients with arthritis with similar levels of physical disability. For MND 
      patients withdrawal from the community was found to be closely related to 
      severity of physical symptoms and depression. Specific patients were identified 
      who are particularly susceptible to withdrawal and depression. Comparison of the 
      pattern of withdrawal in the MND and arthritis patient groups suggested that 
      there may be differences between the factors governing social withdrawal in 
      different patient populations.

TI  - Fatigue. Measures and relation to pain.
PG  - 939-47
AB  - Fatigue describes reduced capacity to sustain force or power output, reduced 
      capacity to perform multiple tasks over time and simply a subjective experience 
      of feeling exhausted, tired, weak or having lack of energy. Pain and fatigue have 
      several components in common, such as being subjective, prevalent in most 
      patients with cancer and caused by multiple factors of both a physical and 
      psychological nature. In order to explore the relationship between fatigue and 
      pain, data from five studies were used: two random samples from the Norwegian 
      population (n=2323 and n=1965), Hodgkin's disease survivors (n=459), palliative 
      care patients (n=434) and patients with bone metastases (n=94). All patients had 
      completed one or more of the following instruments: EORTC QLQ-C30, SF-36 and/or 
      Fatigue Questionnaire. The level of fatigue was much higher in the two palliative 
      care populations (54.4 and 63.2) as compared to the normal population samples 
      (25.0). Patients with bone metastases had significantly more pain (72.0) than the 
      patients in the palliative care trial (47.4) and norms (20.5). In the two 
      palliative care and bone metastases populations fatigue was almost unchanged over 
      time, while pain was reduced. In the palliative care population a high level of 
      fatigue (80.3) and pain (57.8) was reported 0-1 month before death. The 
      relationship between pain, fatigue and the health-related quality of life domains 
      should be explored in more detail, especially in follow-up studies in order to 
      assess possible changes over time. In addition, the validity of the existing 
      instruments measuring fatigue should be investigated for use in patients with 
      advanced disease and short life expectancy.

TI  - [The Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Psychometric properties of its adaptation into 
      Spanish].
PG  - 15-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the reliability and validity 
      of the Spanish (Spain) version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: The Neuropsychiatric Inventory was administered to the caregivers of 63 
      subjects from the Dementia Unit, Hospital Santa Caterina, Girona. All patients 
      had detailed neuropsychological assessment, and their non-cognitive symptoms were 
      also examined with the CAMDEX. RESULTS: There was a high level of internal 
      consistency reliability. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory subscores correlated with 
      those of the CAMDEX, indicating an acceptable level of validity. The most 
      frequent symptom was apathy (56%), followed by irritability (38%), 
      depression/dysphoria (35%), aberrant motor behavior (30%), agitation/aggression 
      (29%), anxiety (27%), disinhibition (24%), delusions (19%), hallucinations (14%) 
      and euphoria (3%). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the Spanish version of the 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory is a reliable instrument, which can briefly assess 
      non-cognitive symptoms in demented patients. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory is a 
      useful instrument for research and clinical practice in different culture around 
      the world.

TI  - Psychopathology in the Dogon Plateau: an assessment using the QDSM and principal 
      components analysis.
PG  - 282-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present paper reports the findings of principal components 
      analysis performed on the basis of answers to the Questionnaire pour le Depistage 
      en Santé Mentale (QDSM) administered to subjects from the Bandiagara plateau 
      (Mali), who had been evaluated in a previously published report. METHODS: The 
      study sample was made up of 466 subjects (253 males, 213 females), 273 of whom 
      belonged to the Dogon ethnic group, 163 were Peul and the remaining 30 belonged 
      to other groups (Sonrai, Bozo, Tuareg, Bambara). All subjects were submitted to 
      QDSM, a structured interview derived from the Self Reporting Questionnaire. Data 
      obtained were processed by means of principal components analysis, in order to 
      obtain syndromic aggregations. RESULTS: Eight factors with an Eigen value greater 
      than 1 were extracted, which provided sufficient explanation for the overall 
      variance observed among the 23 items. These factors may be termed as follows: 
      Sadness (factor 1); Dysphoria (factor 2); Nightmares (factor 3); Persecution 
      (factor 4); Somatic symptoms (factor 5); Special powers (factor 6); Hopelessness 
      (factor 7); Loss of Interest (factor 8). CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this 
      study support the hypothesis of an independence of "psychosomatic" from 
      depressive symptoms. In particular, contrary to some evidence derived from other 
      African studies, the present research appears to suggest a possible 
      counterposition of these two ways of expressing depression, commonly considered 
      as autonomous.

TI  - Development of the EURO-D scale--a European, Union initiative to compare symptoms 
      of depression in 14 European centres.
PG  - 330-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: In an 11-country European collaboration, 14 population-based surveys 
      included 21,724 subjects aged > or = 65 years. Most participating centres used 
      the Geriatric Mental State (GMS), but other measures were also used. AIMS: To 
      derive from these instruments a common depression symptoms scale, the EURO-D, to 
      allow comparison of risk factor profiles between centres. METHOD: Common items 
      were identified from the instruments. Algorithms for fitting items to GMS were 
      derived by observation of item correspondence or expert opinion. The resulting 
      12-item scale was checked for internal consistency, criterion validity and 
      uniformity of factor-analytic profile. RESULTS: The EURO-D is internally 
      consistent, capturing the essence of its parent instrument. A two-factor solution 
      seemed appropriate: depression, tearfulness and wishing to die loaded on the 
      first factor (affective suffering), and loss of interest, poor concentration and 
      lack of enjoyment on the second (motivation). CONCLUSIONS: The EURO-D scale 
      should permit valid comparison of risk-factor associations between centres, even 
      if between-centre variation remains difficult to attribute.

TI  - Fatigue and other symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease: do women and men differ?
PG  - 201-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Describe the symptoms experienced by patients with chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease (COPD), compare women and men with regard to their physical and 
      psychologic symptoms, and determine the predictors of fatigue for the group as a 
      whole and for women separately. DESIGN: Correlational, predictive. PARTICIPANTS: 
      One hundred four (48 women/56 men) outpatients with severe COPD and a mean age of 
      60 years. MEASURES: Self-report of fatigue using the SF-36 energy/fatigue 
      subscale and a "lack of energy" question. Self-report of dyspnea, general 
      symptoms using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, and psychologic symptoms 
      using the Brief Symptom Inventory. Pulmonary function tests and arterial blood 
      gas levels. RESULTS: Patients reported a moderate level of fatigue (mean of 44 on 
      the SF-36), with no difference in the reports of men and women. When reporting 
      their "lack of energy" during the past week, women reported more fatigue than did 
      men. Other symptoms in descending order of reporting were dyspnea and cough. More 
      women reported "don't look like myself" than did men. Women and men were similar 
      in their psychologic symptoms except anxiety, which was higher in women (t = 
      2.64, p < .01). Predictors of fatigue (SF-36 subscale) for the group as a whole 
      were found to be dyspnea and physical symptoms, predicting 42% of the variance. 
      For the women alone, dyspnea and physical symptoms entered the equation, to 
      predict 67% of the variance in fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Predictors of fatigue were 
      similar for women compared to the group as a whole, with symptoms having more of 
      an impact on fatigue than did physiologic variables.

TI  - The clinical picture of frontotemporal dementia: diagnosis and follow-up.
PG  - 10-4
AB  - Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) was diagnosed in 74 outpatients with a standardized 
      assessment including neuropsychological tests, behavioural scale, structural and 
      functional imaging. Clinical characteristics were consistent with the literature 
      data. The cohort was followed for 2-6 years to determine the reliable variable 
      for evaluating the progression of FTD. Every fourth patient died after a mean 
      duration of 7 years. At first, FTD manifests itself in behavioural changes with 
      relatively stable global cognition although language, verbal fluency and memory 
      tests were reliable tools to follow the progression of the disease. Below 18 of 
      Mini-Mental State Examination, mutism and apathy prevented from 
      neuropsychological testing within the next 6 months. Behavioural disorders 
      evolved with time but restlessness and hyperorality were long-lasting. Imaging 
      showed the progression of a consistent pattern of anterior abnormalities with 
      frequent leukoaraiosis.

TI  - Mechanisms underlying diminished novelty-seeking behavior in patients with 
      probable Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 58-66
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To better understand apathy and disengagement in patients with 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), the authors investigated possible behavioral mechanisms 
      underlying diminished novelty-seeking activity in patients with probable AD. 
      BACKGROUND: Apathy and disengagement have been shown to be the most common 
      behavioral changes associated with AD. METHOD: Patients and age-matched normal 
      controls had their eye movements recorded while pairs of line drawings pitting an 
      incongruous figure against a congruous figure were shown on a screen for 12 
      seconds. Characteristics of a subset of AD patients who were indifferent to novel 
      visual stimuli as measured by exploratory eye movements were compared to those of 
      a subset of AD patients who were attracted to novel stimuli to a degree similar 
      to that of normal controls. RESULTS: The indifferent patients were judged by 
      informants, who completed a personality questionnaire, to exhibit a greater 
      degree of apathy. The two AD groups did not differ in overall dementia severity 
      or performance on a Saccade-to-Target Task that required shifts of attention and 
      gaze. In a separate task, the indifferent patients were able to accurately 
      identify the more novel stimuli in 97.5% of trials. Normal control subjects 
      exhibited a strong bias toward processing novel stimuli, directing a higher 
      proportion of their first fixations and dwell time to the incongruous stimuli 
      whether the analysis was run for 3, 6, or 12 seconds of viewing. Indifferent 
      patients did not direct their initial fixation toward novel stimuli and 
      distributed their looking time evenly between incongruous and congruous stimuli 
      throughout all measured intervals. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the 
      indifference to novelty observed in some patients with probable AD cannot simply 
      be attributed to global cognitive decline, more elementary attentional deficits, 
      more rapid habituation of response to novel stimuli, or an inability to 
      discriminate upon demand between stimuli of varying degrees of novelty. It is 
      more likely that their behavior reflects a disruption, by AD pathology, of neural 
      systems that modulate behavioral engagement and maintain attentional bias toward 
      novel events in the environment.

TI  - Presentation and stability of noncognitive symptom patterns in patients with 
      Alzheimer disease.
PG  - 323-9
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate noncognitive symptoms in Alzheimer 
      disease to identify symptom patterns and to study stability of such patterns 
      prospectively. Furthermore, variables were examined that could be associated with 
      certain types of symptom patterns or could be predictors of change of these 
      patterns. Forty-eight patients with the clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer 
      disease were included in this study and were assessed weekly over a 3-week 
      period. Noncognitive symptoms were rated according to the Behavioral 
      Abnormalities in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale and the Dementia Mood 
      Assessment Scale and to a set of items that specifically assess 
      misidentifications. By means of principal component factor analysis different 
      noncognitive symptom patterns were obtained, yielding a four-factor solution. 
      They mapped onto rational domains with respect to clinical experience: 
      depression, apathy, psychotic symptoms/aggression, and 
      misidentifications/agitation. Demographic and clinical variables were not 
      associated with the factor solutions and did not predict change of the factor 
      values. The results demonstrate that in Alzheimer disease there are distinct 
      noncognitive symptom patterns that hold at least short-term prospective 
      stability. None of the examined clinical variables, such as age at entry, the 
      status of the patients (outpatient or inpatient), or dementia severity, exerted 
      substantial influence on the noncognitive symptom patterns. Further 
      investigations should concentrate on the pathological and prognostic correlates 
      of noncognitive symptom patterns in Alzheimer disease.

TI  - Neuropsychiatric features of corticobasal degeneration.
PG  - 717-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterise the neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients with 
      corticobasal degeneration (CBD). METHODS: The neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI), a 
      tool with established validity and reliability, was administered to 15 patients 
      with CBD (mean (SEM), age 67.9 (2) years); 34 patients with progressive 
      supranuclear palsy (PSP) (66.6 (1.2) years); and 25 controls (70 (0.8) years), 
      matched for age and education. Both patient groups had similar duration of 
      symptoms and mini mental state examination scores. Semantic fluency and motor 
      impairment were also assessed. RESULTS: Patients with CBD exhibited depression 
      (73%), apathy (40%), irritability (20%), and agitation (20%) but less often had 
      anxiety, disinhibition, delusions, or aberrant motor behaviour (for example, 
      pacing). The depression and irritability of patients with CBD were more frequent 
      and severe than those of patients with PSP. Conversely, patients with PSP 
      exhibited significantly more apathy than patients with CBD. The presence of high 
      depression and irritability and low apathy scale scores correctly differentiated 
      the patients with CBD 88% of the time. The irritability of patients with CBD was 
      significantly associated with disinhibition (r=0.85) and apathy (r=0.72). In CBD, 
      apathy was associated with disinhibition (r=0.67); disinhibition was associated 
      with aberrant motor behaviour (r=0.68) and apathy (r=0.67); and aberrant motor 
      behaviour with delusions (r=1.0). On the other hand, depression was not 
      associated with any other behaviour, suggesting that it has a different 
      pathophysiological mechanism. Symptom duration was associated with total motor 
      scores (r=0.69). However, total motor score was not associated with any behaviour 
      or cognitive scores. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that frontosubcortical 
      pathways mediating cognition, emotion, and motor function in CBD are not affected 
      in parallel. Patients with CBD and PSP have overlapping neuropsychiatric 
      manifestations, but they express distinctive symptom profiles. Evaluating the 
      behavioural abnormalities of parkinsonian patients may help clarify the role of 
      the basal ganglia in behaviour.

TI  - Neuropsychiatric assessment of patients with hyperkinetic and hypokinetic 
      movement disorders.
PG  - 1313-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of the basal ganglia in neuropsychiatric behaviors is not 
      well known. Anatomical, neurophysiological, and neurochemical evidence supports 
      the notion of parallel direct and indirect basal ganglia thalamocortical motor 
      systems, the differential involvement of which accounts for the hypokinesia or 
      hyperkinesia observed in basal ganglia disorders. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the 
      neuropsychiatric manifestations of patients with a hyperkinetic movement 
      disorder, such as Huntington disease (HD), vs a hypokinetic disease, such as 
      progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). To verify if patients with HD show a 
      greater frequency of hyperactive behaviors (eg, agitation, irritation, euphoria, 
      or anxiety), while those with PSP exhibit hypoactive behaviors (eg, apathy). 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Neuropsychiatric Inventory, a tool with established 
      validity and reliability, was administered to 29 patients with HD (mean +/- SD 
      age, 43.8 +/- 2 years) and 34 with PSP (mean +/- SD age, 66.6 +/- 1.2 years), 
      matched for education, symptom duration, and overall degree of dementia. RESULTS: 
      There was no difference between the groups in the total Neuropsychiatric 
      Inventory scores. However, there was a double dissociation in behaviors: patients 
      with HD exhibited significantly more agitation (45%), irritability (38%), and 
      anxiety (34%), whereas patients with PSP exhibited more apathy (82%) (P < .01). 
      Euphoria was present only in patients with HD. CONCLUSIONS: We found that 
      patients with HD manifested predominantly hyperactive behaviors, while those with 
      PSP manifested hypoactive behaviors. Based on our findings and the anatomical 
      lesions known to occur in these disorders, we suggest that the hyperactive 
      behaviors in HD are secondary to an excitatory subcortical output through the 
      medial and orbitofrontal cortical circuits, while in PSP the hypoactive behaviors 
      are secondary to hypostimulation.

PG  - 205-13
AB  - Neuropsychological differences between 14 patients with a clinical diagnosis of 
      frontal lobe degeneration of non-Alzheimer type (FLD) and 15 patients with a 
      clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) were studied. The most efficient 
      psychometric predictors of FLD were Digit Symbol, estimation tasks, word list 
      recall, and particularly the FAS word fluency test. Behavioral predictors of FLD 
      and AD showed a double dissociation: regression and impulsivity characterized 
      FLD, whereas lack of motivation and slowness were typical of AD. Cognitive and 
      behavioral differences between groups were not related to the degree of dementia, 
      as measured by Mini Mental State Examination, indicating that differences 
      remained during progression of the diseases.

TI  - The factor structure of the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia among

AB  - The authors rated 137 outpatients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) on the 
      Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) as part of routine evaluation. 
      Principal-factors analysis with varimax rotation resulted in a four-factor 
      solution that accounted for 43.1% of the common variance. The four factors 
      included general depression (lack of reactivity to pleasant events, poor 
      self-esteem, pessimism, loss of interest, physical complaints, psychomotor 
      retardation, sadness); rhythm disturbances (difficulty falling asleep, multiple 
      night awakenings, early morning awakenings, weight loss, diurnal variation of 
      mood); agitation/psychosis (agitation, mood-congruent delusions, suicide); and 
      negative symptoms (appetite loss, weight loss, lack of energy, loss of interest, 
      lack of reactivity to pleasant events). The observed factor structure showed 
      moderate concordance with the five symptom clusters proposed in the original 
      presentation of the CSDD.

TI  - Invisible residents: the chronically mentally ill elderly in nursing homes.
PG  - 131-9
AB  - This article presents results from a retrospective study of psychological 
      assessments of elderly persons with chronic mental illness residing in nursing 
      homes. All residents (N = 570) received this assessment as part of federally 
      mandated screening for mentally ill persons residing in long-term care. The 
      process, the Preadmission Screening and Resident Review, was mandated by the 
      Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA 87). These assessments were the first 
      stage in a process to determine if the nursing home was the most appropriate 
      placement for each resident. If nursing home care was deemed appropriate, then a 
      psychological treatment program was to be established within the nursing home 
      setting. The sample ranged in age from 50 to 104 (mean of 70). The majority had a 
      diagnosis of schizophrenia and a history of psychiatric hospitalization occurring 
      early in their life. The assessments did not include any quantifiable data on 
      activities of daily living, cognitive functioning, or level of psychiatric 
      impairment. Therefore, the researchers coded the narrative data so that it could 
      be interpreted. The majority functioned within the none-to-mild range of 
      cognitive impairment, and very few were completely dependent in the need for 
      physical care. The most recorded symptom was social withdrawal. Neuroleptic 
      medications were administered to 64% of elderly persons with chronic mental 
      illness. Importantly, there was no relationship between demographic or clinical 
      information and treatment recommendations. Implications of these findings for 
      psychiatric nurses are discussed.

TI  - Use of the Apathy Evaluation Scale as a measure of motivation in elderly people.
PG  - 141-7
AB  - Motivation plays an important part in an elderly individual's ability to recover 
      from a disabling event. On the other hand, apathy is a lack of motivation. The 
      Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is an 18-item instrument that rates a person's 
      thoughts, actions, and emotions over the previous 4 weeks. The purpose of this 
      study was to use the AES with 102 patients in a geriatric rehabilitation program 
      to determine if it predicted improved function after rehabilitation. In addition, 
      a short 7-item version of the AES was tested. A strong correlation was 
      demonstrated between the 18-item AES and the 7-item AES, the Mini-Mental State 
      Examination, and the Geriatric Depression Scale. In separate regression analyses, 
      we found that admission function and both the 18-item and 7-item AES were 
      significant predictors of discharge function, and that functional level at 
      admission to rehabilitation accounted for 31% of the variance in function after 
      rehabilitation. The findings suggest that the AES might be an appropriate measure 
      of motivation in older adults and might predict success in rehabilitation. 
      Moreover, the ability to identify patients with low motivation can alert 
      healthcare providers to develop interventions to improve older adults' motivation 
      and help them attain and maintain their highest functional level.

TI  - [The clinical picture and stability of non-cognitive symptoms in patients with 
      Alzheimer's disease].
PG  - 233-40
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate noncognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's 
      disease in order to identify symptom patterns and to study stability of such 
      patterns prospectively. Furthermore, variables were examined which could be 
      associated with certain types of symptom patterns or could be predictors of 
      change of these patterns. Forty-eight patients with the clinical diagnosis of 
      probable Alzheimer's disease were included in this study and were assessed weekly 
      over a three-week period. Noncognitive symptoms were rated according to the 
      Behavioral Abnormalities in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD) and the 
      Dementia Mood Assessment Scale (DMAS) and to a set of items specifically 
      assessing misidentifications. By means of principal component factor analysis 
      different noncognitive symptom patterns were obtained yielding a four-factor 
      solution. They were mapped as rational domains with respect to clinical 
      experience: 'depression', 'apathy', 'psychotic symptoms/aggression', 
      'misidentifications/agitation'. Demographic and clinical variables were not 
      associated with the factor solutions and did not predict change of the factor 
      values. The results demonstrate that in Alzheimer's disease there are distinct 
      noncognitive symptom patterns with at least short-term prospective stability. 
      None of the examined clinical variables, such as age at entry, the status of the 
      patients (outpatient or inpatient) or dementia severity, exerted substantial 
      influence on the noncognitive symptom patterns. Further investigations should 
      concentrate on the pathological and prognostical correlates of noncognitive 
      symptom patterns in Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Behavioral disorders in Alzheimer disease: a transcultural perspective.
PG  - 539-44
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare 2 samples of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), from 
      Italy and the United States, in order to determine transcultural differences in 
      the manifestation of noncognitive symptoms. To analyze the concurrent validity, 
      internal consistency reliability, between-rater reliability, and test-retest 
      reliability of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Scale (NPI). METHODS: The NPI was 
      given to 50 Italian and 50 US patients with AD. To demonstrate the validity and 
      reliability of the Italian version of the instrument, several different methods 
      of analysis were used. The total score on the NPI and the score of single items 
      in the different stages of the disease were compared in the 2 samples of 
      patients. RESULTS: A high level of internal consistency reliability was 
      confirmed, the between-rater reliability was very high, and the test-retest 
      reliability was significantly correlated. Apathy was the most frequently recorded 
      behavior in the Italian sample. Five of 10 NPI item scores showed a significant 
      relation with the Mini-Mental State Examination scores in both samples. The 
      Italian patients showed an increasing and significantly higher mean NPI total 
      score at all levels of dementia severity when compared with the US patients. The 
      scores on some NPI subscales, such as apathy, aberrant motor behavior, 
      disinhibition, and agitation, were significant higher in Italian patients at 
      different levels of severity covarying with educational level. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results indicate that NPI is a reliable instrument with which to study 
      transcultural differences in the presentation of neuropsychiatric disturbances in 
      patients with AD. The described similar pattern of behaviors between Italians and 
      US patients with AD suggests a biological origin of the disorders. However, 
      cultural influences must be taken in account when the focus of the study is on 
      psychopathological aspects of dementia.

TI  - Assessing the impact of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease: the 
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory Caregiver Distress Scale.
PG  - 210-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop an adjunct scale to the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) 
      for assessing the impact of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      patients on caregiver distress. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive and 
      correlational study. SETTING: University out-patient memory disorders clinics. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-five AD subjects and their caregivers (54 spouses, 31 
      children). MEASUREMENTS: The NPI and NPI Caregiver Distress Scale (NPI-D) were 
      used to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD patients and related caregiver 
      distress, respectively. Criterion validity of the NPI-D was examined (N = 69) by 
      comparison with an abridged version of the Relatives' Stress Scale (RSS'), a 
      general measure of caregiver stress, using item clusters that had previously been 
      correlated to behavioral disturbances in demented patients. Test-retest (n = 20) 
      and inter-rater reliability (n = 16) of the NPI-D were also assessed. RESULTS: 
      Test-retest and interrater reliability of the NPI-D were both adequate. Overall, 
      caregiver NPI-D distress ratings were correlated significantly with the RSS' (r = 
      .60, P < .001). RSS' ratings correlated strongly with NPI scores (r = .64, P < 
      .001), even after controlling for degree of cognitive impairment based on the 
      Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score (r = .61). MMSE scores showed a moderate 
      correlation to RSS' ratings (-.30, P = .02), but this association was markedly 
      attenuated when controlling for the degree of neuropsychiatric disturbance based 
      on the NPI score (r = -. 14). NPI-D ratings for 9 of 10 NPI symptom domains 
      correlated most strongly with either NPI symptom severity or total (frequency x 
      severity) scores. Agitation, dysphoria, irritability, delusions, and apathy were 
      the symptoms most often reported to be severely distressing to caregivers. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The NPI-D provides a reliable and valid measure of subjective 
      caregiver distress in relation to neuropsychiatric symptoms measured by the NPI. 
      Neuropsychiatric alterations are more strongly associated than cognitive symptoms 
      to caregiver distress. The NPI-D may be useful in both clinical and research 
      settings for assessing the contribution to caregiver distress of neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms in AD patients.

      other dementias.
PG  - 38-44
AB  - Depressive disorders--both major depression and other less severe but nonetheless 
      clinically significant depressions--are common comorbidities, components, or 
      complications of dementia. Depression with reversible cognitive impairment may be 
      a prodrome for dementia rather than a separate and distinct disorder. Recent 
      research has demonstrated that both the diagnosis of major depression and the 
      assessment of typical depressive symptoms can be conducted reliably, even in 
      patients with mild-to-moderate levels of cognitive impairment. Self-ratings of 
      depressive symptoms with the Geriatric Depression Scale remain valid in patients 
      with Mini-Mental State Examination scores of at least 15. Among 
      interviewer-administered instruments, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 
      and the Cornell Scale are the best established. Potential difficulties with 
      assessment include problems with ascertainment (because families, in general, 
      report greater depression in patients than do clinicians) and the ambiguity of 
      symptoms (because apathy and related symptoms can result from both depression and 
      Alzheimer's disease). Brain changes due to Alzheimer's disease may lead to 
      fundamental differences in drug responses. Nevertheless, randomized clinical 
      trials have demonstrated that depression in dementia responds to specific 
      psychopharmacologic or psychosocial treatments.

PG  - 219-26
AB  - We investigated the construct validity of subscales of the Scale for the 
      Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) and the Scale for the Assessment of 
      Negative Symptoms (SANS) along with other measures of psychopathology in 109 
      schizophrenia outpatients aged 45-84 years. Scores on subscales of the SAPS, SANS 
      and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and on the Hamilton Depression Scale 
      (HAM-D) were subjected to a principal components analysis and orthogonal rotation 
      followed by an extension analysis. In both analyses, three of four SAPS subscales 
      had their highest loading on the positive symptom factor and four of five SANS 
      subscales had their highest factor loading on the negative symptom factor. The 
      SAPS bizarre behavior subscale, however, had a much higher loading on the 
      depressive symptom factor than on the positive symptom factor, and the SANS 
      avolition-apathy subscale had moderate loadings on both the negative symptom 
      factor and the depressive symptom factor. The use of SAPS and SANS subscales to 
      represent two constructs was largely (but not entirely) validated among 
      middle-aged and elderly schizophrenia outpatients. The SAPS bizarre behavior 
      subscale and, to a lesser extent, the SANS avolition-apathy subscale appear to 
      represent in this older population a separate construct which may be related to 
      depressive symptoms.

PG  - 674-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the performance of four brief screening measures 
      for depression in a group of terminally ill patients. The methods included 1) a 
      single-item interview assessing depressed mood, 2) a two-item interview assessing 
      depressed mood and loss of interest in activities, 3) a visual analog scale for 
      depressed mood, and 4) the Beck Depression Inventory-Short Form. METHOD: 
      Semistructured diagnostic interviews for depression were administered to 197 
      patients receiving palliative care for advanced cancer. The interview diagnoses 
      served as the standards against which the screening performance of the four brief 
      screening methods was assessed. RESULTS: Single-item interview screening 
      correctly identified the eventual diagnostic outcome of every patient, 
      substantially outperforming the questionnaire and visual analog measures. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Brief screening measures for depression are important clinical tools 
      for terminally ill patients. For diagnostic purposes, however, they do not 
      approach the validity of a single-item interview that asks, in effect, "Are you 
      depressed?"

TI  - [Japanese version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory--a scoring system for 
      neuropsychiatric disturbance in dementia patients].
PG  - 266-71
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neuropsychiatric disturbances are common and burdensome 
      symptoms of dementias. Assessment and measurement of neuropsychiatric 
      disturbances are indispensable to the management of patients with dementia and 
      for clinical research. No standardized instruments have been developed for these 
      purposes in Japan. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), developed by Cummings et 
      al., is a standardized, validated, and reliable tool to assess a wide range of 
      neuropsychiatric derangements in patients with dementia, and has been used in 
      clinical studies in North America. In this study, we prepared a Japanese version 
      of the NPI and tested its reliability and usefulness in dementia patients. 
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The subjects were 174 patients with dementia, including 
      Alzheimer's disease (140), frontotemporal dementia (12), vascular dementia (19), 
      and normal pressure hydrocephalus (3), whose diagnosis was made on the basis of 
      the results of extensive examinations including MRI and PET/SPECT of the brain 
      and appropriate clinical diagnostic criteria for each disorder. The subjects 
      consisted of 133 women and 41 men; their mean age was 72.6 +/- 7.7 years (S.D.; 
      range: 49 to 88) years. An examiner (neurologist) used the NPI to interview a 
      caregiver familiar with the patient's everyday behavior. In 24 randomly selected 
      patients interview was repeated by another examiner (psychiatrist) one month 
      later, and test-retest reliability was evaluated. The Clinical Dementia Rating 
      (CDR), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Alzheimer's Disease 
      Assessment Scale (ADAS) were used to assess the severity of the dementia and 
      cognitive impairment. RESULTS: The MMSE scores ranged from 5 to 29 (mean +/- SD = 
      19.0 +/- 4.8) and the ADAS scores ranged from 7 to 63 (24.3 +/- 10.9). The CDR 
      score was 0.5 in 17 patients, 1 in 95 patients, 2 in 52 patients, and 3 in 10 
      patient. Test-retest reliability of each score was acceptably high, and the 
      correlation coefficient for each score obtained by repeated assessments in this 
      study was similar to the coefficient in the original report. Apathy was the most 
      common behavior in the ten abnormal behavioral domains, and euphoria was the 
      least common. The prevalence of abnormal findings was also comparable to the 
      results in the original report. The total NPI scores and many of the NPI subscale 
      scores were significantly correlated with both the severity of dementia and 
      cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: This Japanese version of NPI, whose 
      reliability and competency are comparable to those of the original version, is a 
      reliable and useful tool for measuring neuropsychiatric disturbances in dementia 
      patients.

TI  - Frontal behavioral inventory: diagnostic criteria for frontal lobe dementia.
PG  - 29-36
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To utilize the diagnostic criteria of frontal lobe dementia (FLD). 
      METHODS: We studied 12 patients with FLD diagnosed clinically, with radiological 
      confirmation in 10 and autopsy confirmation in 2; sixteen patients with 
      Alzheimer's disease matched for stage and severity to FLD and 11 patients with 
      depressive dementia were used as control groups. A 24-item Frontal Behavioral 
      Inventory (FBI) using the most relevant behavioral manifestations of FLD was 
      administered in these populations. RESULTS: FLD patient scores on the FBI were 
      much higher compared with control groups (AD and DD). Item analysis showed loss 
      of insight, indifference, distractibility, personal neglect and apathy as the 
      most frequent negative symptoms. Perseveration, disinhibition, inappropriateness, 
      impulsivity, and irresponsibility were the most significant positive symptoms. An 
      operational definition of FLD included a minimum FBI score of 27. Only one false 
      positive was shown in the depressive group and none among the AD group, 
      indicating little overlap between patient groups, and a high discriminating value 
      of the FBI. CONCLUSIONS: The FBI appears to be a useful diagnostic instrument and 
      a method to operate the behavioral criteria of FLD. Further prospective studies 
      are warranted to establish validity.

TI  - Vegetative and psychological symptoms associated with depressed mood over the 
      first two years after stroke.
PG  - 137-57
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In patients with acute physical illness, symptoms used in the 
      diagnosis of major depression such as sleep or appetite disturbance may be 
      nonspecific for depression. This study was undertaken to examine the association 
      of depressed mood with other depressive symptoms to determine which symptoms were 
      most useful in the accurate diagnosis of major depression after stroke. METHODS: 
      Using a structured mental status examination, 142 patients with acute stroke were 
      followed at three, six, twelve, and twenty-four months. RESULTS: The median 
      number of vegetative and psychological symptoms among patients with depressed 
      mood was more than three times the respective rates among nondepressed patients 
      at all time points over two years. Autonomic anxiety, morning depression, 
      subjective anergia, worrying, brooding, loss of interest, hopelessness, and lack 
      of self-confidence were significantly more frequent among depressed patients than 
      nondepressed patients throughout the entire two-year period. Some symptoms such 
      as anxious foreboding and loss of libido, as well as self-depreciation, feelings 
      of guilt, and irritability were no longer significantly more common among 
      depressed compared with nondepressed patients after six months. Standard DSM-IV 
      diagnostic criteria and modified DSM-IV diagnostic criteria which included only 
      specific symptoms of depression (i.e., symptoms which were significantly more 
      frequent among depressed than nondepressed mood patients) yielded similar 
      frequencies of major depression diagnosis. There were only a few patients (i.e., 
      2% to 3%) with depressive symptoms without a depressed mood (perhaps "masked" 
      depression). CONCLUSIONS: Vegetative and psychological depressive symptoms are 
      significantly more common in depressed patients over the first two years after 
      stroke and DSM-IV criteria do not overdiagnose major depression even in this 
      population with chronic physical illness. The symptoms which characterize major 
      depression appear to change between the subacute and chronic post-stroke periods.

AB  - The reliability of the Japanese version of the Inventory to Diagnose Depression 
      (IDD) which is a self-report to diagnose major depressive disorders (MDD) of 
      DSM-III-R, was investigated in 30 cases with MDD and 30 control subjects. On 
      test-retest reliability, the agreement of diagnostic performance was substantial 
      (kappa = 0.64, P < 0.001) for 60 subjects, and scores of total and individual 
      items correlated significantly (P < 0.001) between test and retest except for 
      decreased energy, decreased interest, and decreased concentration. The average 
      score of the total IDD severity at test (38.4) was significantly higher than that 
      at retest (28.0; P < 0.01). However, excluding the recovered 10 cases, there was 
      no significant difference seen on the average total score between test and retest 
      (38.8, 30.1, respectively). Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.80) and 
      split-half reliability (0.79) were sufficient, and item-total correlations of the 
      IDD were significant (P < 0.01) except for weight gain. The IDD might be useful 
      as a screening tool and for clinical evaluation of subjects in Japan; however, it 
      is necessary to examine the validity of this instrument.

TI  - Fibromyalgia outcome: the predictive values of symptom duration, physical 
      activity, disability pension, and critical life events--a 4.5 year prospective 
      study.
PG  - 235-43
AB  - Forty-four fibromyalgia patients were followed through 4.5 years to assess the 
      extent to which symptom duration, physical activity level, disability pensions, 
      and the occurrence of critical life events would predict long-term outcome. 
      Outcome measures included pressure tenderness (dolorimeter score), work capacity 
      (ergometer cycle test), global subjective improvement (verbal rating scale), and 
      visual analogue scale ratings of pain, disturbed sleep, lack of energy, and 
      depression. Significant outcome predictors were identified by means of separate 
      multiple regression analyses on each outcome measure at follow-up, using symptom 
      duration, physical activity level, disability pension status, and occurrence of 
      critical life events as independent variables, together with baseline symptom 
      intensity and age, which were adjusted for. An adequate physical activity level 
      and increasing age predicted a positive outcome, while receiving a permanent 
      disability pension or having experienced an excess of major negative life events 
      predicted a negative outcome. Symptom duration did not affect outcome.

TI  - The ABCs of managing hyperthyroidism in the older patient.
PG  - 22-4,27,31-2
AB  - Hyperthyroidism in the older patient often presents with nonspecific symptoms, 
      such as apathy, weight loss, and atrial fibrillation. General screening is not 
      cost-effective, with the exception of two populations: women over age 40 with one 
      or more nonspecific complaints and patients being admitted to a specialized 
      geriatric unit. The sensitive TSH test is an excellent screen; a low TSH should 
      be confirmed by an actual or estimated high free thyroxine test (FT4). The RAIU 
      can help narrow the differential diagnosis. Radioiodine is the preferred 
      treatment for the older patient with Graves' disease, the most common form of 
      thyrotoxicosis. Graves' must be differentiated from thyroiditis and toxic nodular 
      goiters, as treatment regimens differ for each disorder.

      document distinct response pattern clusters during combined continuation therapy. 
      METHOD: Box plot analyses of Hamilton depression scores and Global Assessment 
      Scale scores, repeated twice monthly over 4 months, were conducted using data 
      from 105 elderly depressives. Temporal trends in the data were examined via 
      random regression analysis. Individual trajectories for each of the 105 patients 
      were examined for patterns of response during continuation therapy. RESULTS: We 
      observed a low mean Hamilton rating of 7 (SD = 2.3) at the start of continuation 
      therapy and 5 (SD = 3.0) at the end. Both Hamilton and GAS scores showed modest 
      but significant improvement over time. Hamilton variability was most apparent in 
      symptoms of mood lowering, apathy, anxiety (psychological and somatic), feelings 
      of guilt, anergia, insomnia, and loss of libido; other symptoms (retardation, 
      agitation, hypochondriasis, loss of appetite, loss of weight, suicidal ideation, 
      and loss of insight) showed clear resolution. A diagnosis of RDC situational 
      depression was associated with higher levels of residual symptoms, while level of 
      chronic medical burden, personality dysfunction, and social support were not. 
      Examination of response patterns showed that a quarter of patients experienced 
      one or more brief symptomatic exacerbations. CONCLUSION: On average, an excellent 
      level of symptom resolution was achieved for most patients with Hamilton scores 
      comparable to those seen in healthy elderly controls. These data support a 
      position of therapeutic optimism in late-life depression and underscore full 
      remission as an achievable therapeutic goal.

TI  - Application of the multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI-20) in cancer patients 
      receiving radiotherapy.
PG  - 241-5
AB  - In this paper the psychometric properties of the multidimensional fatigue 
      inventory (MFI-20) are established further in cancer patients. The MFI is a 
      20-item self-report instrument designed to measure fatigue. It covers the 
      following dimensions: general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced activity, 
      reduced motivation and mental fatigue. The instrument was used in a Dutch and 
      Scottish sample of cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. The dimensional 
      structure was assessed using confirmatory factor analyses (Lisrel's unweighted 
      least-squares method). The hypothesised five-factor model appeared to fit the 
      data in both samples (adjusted goodness of fit; AGFI: 0.97 and 0.98). Internal 
      consistency of the separate scales was good in both the Dutch and Scottish 
      samples with Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.93. Construct 
      validity was assessed by correlating the MFI-20 to activities of daily living, 
      anxiety and depression. Significant relations were assumed. Convergent validity 
      was investigated by correlating the MFI scales with a visual analogue scale 
      measuring fatigue and with a fatigue-scale derived from the Rotterdam Symptom 
      Checklist. Results support the validity of the MFI-20. The highly similar results 
      in the Dutch and Scottish sample suggest that the portrayal of fatigue using the 
      MFI-20 is quite robust.

TI  - What things are important in people's lives? A survey of the public's judgements 
      to inform scales of health related quality of life.
PG  - 1447-62
AB  - The research presented here aimed to obtain population norms on pertinent domains 
      of quality of life and health related quality of life, and the relative 
      importance of these domains to people. The OPCS Omnibus Survey was used as the 
      vehicle for the study. This is a monthly survey of a random sample of 2000 adult 
      members of the population in Great Britain, based on a random sample of 
      households. The data was collected for a one month period. The response rate to 
      the survey was 77%. In response to a generic question about the five (priority 
      ordered) most important things in their lives (good or bad), respondents were 
      most likely to freely mention as the first most important thing in their lives 
      relationships with family or relatives, followed by their own health, the health 
      of another (close) person and finances/standard of living/housing. When responses 
      relating to respondents' priority ranked areas 1-5 were combined, the most 
      frequently mentioned area of life was finances/standard of living/housing, 
      followed by relationships with family and friends, own health, the health of 
      close others and social life/leisure activities. Thus, different distributions 
      were obtained depending on whether priority ordering or frequency with which item 
      was mentioned was analysed. Of those who reported a longstanding illness, the 
      conditions which were most likely to be reported as affecting their lives were 
      respiratory conditions, joint disorders and heart and circulatory diseases. The 
      most commonly freely mentioned first most important effects of the longstanding 
      illness on their lives were (in order of frequency) ability to get out and 
      about/stand/walk/go out shopping, being able to work/find a job and effects on 
      social life/leisure activities (based on office coding from verbatim responses 
      recorded on the questionnaire). When the responses relating to respondents' 
      priority ranks 1-5 were combined, the most frequently mentioned area of life 
      affected was ability to get out and about/stand/walk/go out shopping, followed by 
      social life/leisure activities, and availability of work/ability to work. Again, 
      differences in distributions were obtained depending on the method of analysis. 
      Further investigations also revealed differences according to the method of 
      questioning and coding (respondent vs office). When respondents selected their 
      own codes from a showcard in relation to health effects, there were some 
      discrepancies with their (office coded) verbatim replies (which were recorded by 
      the interviewer before they saw the showcard, for later office coding). The 
      showcard had the effect of prompting them, and the then most commonly mentioned 
      first most important effects of the longstanding illness on their lives were (in 
      order of frequency) pain, tiredness/lack of energy/lethargy, social life/leisure 
      activities, and availability of work/ability to work. This discrepancy 
      illustrates the biasing influence of using showcards, in comparison with the open 
      coding of actual verbatim responses back in the office (on the assumption that 
      the latter are more valid-unprompted-responses). Analysis of the domains included 
      in the most popularly used health status scales, which are used to measure health 
      related quality of life, revealed that several items ranked as important by the 
      public were missing.

TI  - The Behavior Rating Scale for Dementia of the Consortium to Establish a Registry 
      for Alzheimer's Disease. The Behavioral Pathology Committee of the Consortium to 
      Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 1349-57
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to develop a standardized instrument, the 
      Behavior Rating Scale for Dementia, for rating psychopathology in patients with 
      probable Alzheimer's disease and to conduct a multicenter pilot study of this 
      instrument. METHOD: The rating scale was developed collaboratively on the basis 
      of clinical experience and existing instruments. Items were scaled according to 
      frequency of psychopathology and were administered to an informant who was 
      familiar with the subject. The scale was administered in a standardized manner by 
      trained examiners who had met predetermined certification standards. The study 
      group consisted of 303 subjects with probable Alzheimer's disease who had 
      undergone standardized clinical evaluations by the Consortium to Establish a 
      Registry for Alzheimer's Disease. RESULTS: Subjects had an average of 15 problems 
      rated as present in the preceding month. Wide variability in the nature of 
      disturbances was found, with a number of items rated as present since the illness 
      began but not in the past month. Interrater agreement was high. Factor analysis 
      suggested eight preliminary factors that mapped onto clinically relevant domains: 
      depressive features, psychotic features, defective self-regulation, 
      irritability/agitation, vegetative features, apathy, aggression, and affective 
      lability. CONCLUSIONS: The Behavior Rating Scale for Dementia provides a 
      standardized, reliable measure that can be administered to caregivers of demented 
      subjects. On the basis of the present study, the scale has been revised slightly. 
      After additional studies in progress, the Behavior Rating Scale for Dementia will 
      be available for general use in assessing a wide range of psychopathology in 
      dementia.

TI  - Analysis of positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. A study from a 
      population of long-term outpatients.
PG  - 178-82
AB  - Sixty-seven schizophrenic chronic outpatients (DSM-III-R criteria) were examined 
      to study the relationship between symptoms through intercorrelational and factor 
      analysis. Three factors were identified and associated with clusters of symptoms: 
      factor 1 (affective flattening, alogia, avolition-apathy and 
      anhedonia-asociality), factor 2 (formal thought disorder and bizarre behaviour) 
      and factor 3 (hallucinations and delusions). Strong associations between factor 1 
      and high functional impairment were found. In this population, the segregation of 
      the symptoms could fit into a three-syndrome model, these results agree with 
      findings obtained from samples in which acute symptoms predominated.

TI  - Clinical assessment of mental decline in elderly people: a proposal for a new 
      quantitative index.
PG  - 29-34
AB  - Despite the many instruments available for assessing elderly people, there is a 
      need for additional methods to measure mental decline that would also be 
      applicable in cross sectional and longitudinal studies. With this purpose in 
      mind, our group developed and checked a new instrument, the Index of Mental 
      Decline (IMD), which consists of five clusters of items intended for the 
      assessment of cognition, personal interrelationships, affective disorders, apathy 
      and somatic complaints. To improve its consistency, all clusters and items were 
      evaluated individually, according to their clinical impact. Three levels of 
      symptom importance were determined: absent to very mild, mild to moderate, severe 
      to very severe. Inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability were 
      demonstrated in a sample of 59 subjects, and proved to be satisfactory. The 
      validity of the IMD was tested in a group of 203 patients, in whom a clinical 
      diagnosis of probable dementia (DSM III-R criteria) had been formulated. The 
      results suggest the effectiveness of the IMD both in quantifying mental decline 
      and monitoring clinical symptoms. The IMD cannot be the first step of diagnostic 
      procedure, but it can be useful for evaluating mental decline in elderly subjects 
      with cognitive disorders. In longitudinal studies, the presence of the same 
      caregiver or informant is compulsory.

TI  - Perceptual and enactment measurement of self-care.
PG  - 29-33
AB  - The concept of self-care was conceptualized as having three major components: 
      enabling perceptual elements (motivation, values, responsibility, and decision 
      making); domains for enactment (cognitive/ perceptual, psychosocial/affective, 
      and physical functioning); and self-care enactment factors (capacity), which 
      included self-care action and knowledge adequate for self-care. A new tool, The 
      Self-Care Agency Inventory, was designed to discriminate between those who will 
      enact self-care and those who will not because of either a lack of knowledge or a 
      lack of motivation. Content validity was demonstrated (.77 or greater from each

TI  - [Suicidal behavior of depressed patients at inpatient admission].
PG  - 28-35
AB  - Early recognition of suicidal behavior is of extreme importance for avoidance of 
      this cause of death. The risk of suicide attempts is particularly high in 
      psychiatric illness, and among hospital in-patients especially in those with 
      depression. Thus, the risk of suicide should be estimated in the first interview 
      after admission to a psychiatric hospital. Our study analysed the routine 
      documentation of such interviews on admission to the Psychiatrische Klinik der 
      Freien Universität in Berlin: 41% of all depressive patients were suicidal. 
      Suicidal and non-suicidal depressive patients could be differentiated by the 
      following traits: suicidal patients were younger, had been younger at the initial 
      onset of depressive illness, had made more suicide attempts in the past, and had 
      a greater number of relatives who had committed suicide or made suicide attempts. 
      They were more often single or divorced, and had fewer children of their own. 
      Their psychopathology was characterized by a more strongly developed syndrome of 
      depression, hostility and apathy. These findings point to a pattern of 
      characteristics that are linked with suicidal behavior, which can be used to 
      estimate the risk of suicide right at the beginning of a stay in hospital.

TI  - Psychopathological dimensions in schizophrenia.
PG  - 473-82
AB  - To test underlying latent syndromes within schizophrenic syndromes assessed by 
      the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), a sample of 100 DSM-III-R 
      schizophrenia patients was obtained through a semistructured interview for 
      schizophrenia. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the underlying 
      symptomatological dimensions. The positive and negative construct was not 
      confirmed by this study. The three- and four-dimension models obtained higher 
      goodness of fit than the one- or two-dimension models. Models composed of three 
      or four dimensions shared positive and negative syndromes, in addition to 
      "disorder of relating" and/or "disorganization" dimensions. The disorder of 
      relating dimension of PANSS was composed of emotional withdrawal and 
      passive/apathetic social withdrawal. The disorganization dimension comprised two 
      symptoms of PANSS (conceptual disorganization and poor attention) and an item not 
      included in the PANSS: inappropriate affect. It is suggested that a schedule for 
      the assessment of this item be added to the PANSS.

TI  - The Neuropsychiatric Inventory: comprehensive assessment of psychopathology in 
      dementia.
PG  - 2308-14
AB  - We developed a new instrument, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), to assess 10 
      behavioral disturbances occurring in dementia patients: delusions, 
      hallucinations, dysphoria, anxiety, agitation/aggression, euphoria, 
      disinhibition, irritability/lability, apathy, and aberrant motor activity. The 
      NPI uses a screening strategy to minimize administration time, examining and 
      scoring only those behavioral domains with positive responses to screening 
      questions. Both the frequency and the severity of each behavior are determined. 
      Information for the NPI is obtained from a caregiver familiar with the patient's 
      behavior. Studies reported here demonstrate the content and concurrent validity 
      as well as between-rater, test-retest, and internal consistency reliability; the 
      instrument is both valid and reliable. The NPI has the advantages of evaluating a 
      wider range of psychopathology than existing instruments, soliciting information 
      that may distinguish among different etiologies of dementia, differentiating 
      between severity and frequency of behavioral changes, and minimizing 
      administration time.

TI  - Symptom prevalence, characteristics and distress in a cancer population.
PG  - 183-9
AB  - Despite the importance of symptom control in the cancer population, few studies 
      have systematically assessed the prevalence and characteristics of symptoms or 
      the interactions between various symptom characteristics and other factors 
      related to quality of life (QOL). As part of a validation study of a new symptom 
      assessment instrument, inpatients and outpatients with prostate, colon, breast or 
      ovarian cancer were evaluated using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale and 
      other measures of psychological condition, performance status, symptom distress 
      and overall quality of life. The mean age of the 243 evaluable patients was 55.5 
      years (range 23-86 years); over 60% were women and almost two-thirds had 
      metastatic disease. The Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score was < or = 80 in 
      49.8% and 123 were inpatients at the time of assessment. Across tumour types, 
      40-80% experienced lack of energy, pain, feeling drowsy, dry mouth, insomnia, or 
      symptoms indicative of psychological distress. Although symptom characteristics 
      were variable, the proportion of patients who described a symptom as relatively 
      intense or frequent always exceeded the proportion who reported it as highly 
      distressing. The mean (+/- SD range) number of symptoms per patient was 11.5 +/- 
      6.0 (0-25); inpatients had more symptoms than outpatients (13.5 +/- 5.4 vs. 9.7 
      +/- 6.0, p < 0.002) and those with KPS < or = 80 had more symptoms than those 
      with KPS > 80 (14.8 +/- 5.5 vs. 9.2 +/- 4.9, p < 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

TI  - Group differences in the relationship between apathy and depression.
PG  - 235-9
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the discriminability of apathy and 
      depression by determining whether the relationship of these two dimensions of 
      behavior varies in different diagnostic groups. Using the authors' Apathy 
      Evaluation Scale and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, we rated 123 
      subjects, mean age 72 years, who met research criteria for healthy elderly 
      controls, left or right hemisphere stroke, probable Alzheimer's disease, and 
      major depression. Elevated apathy scores unassociated with elevated depression 
      were most frequent in Alzheimer's disease and right hemisphere stroke, and also 
      occurred in a small number of left hemisphere stroke and normal subjects. In 
      major depression, apathy was associated with high depression scores, although a 
      substantial number of major depressives showed elevated depression without 
      elevated apathy. In left hemisphere stroke, probable Alzheimer's disease, and 
      major depression, there were significant positive correlations between apathy and 
      depression. The slope of the regression of apathy on depression was greatest in 
      probable Alzheimer's disease and major depression. These results indicate that 
      the relationship between apathy and depression differs across diagnostic groups 
      and, thus, support the discriminability of apathy and depression.

TI  - The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale: an instrument for the evaluation of 
      symptom prevalence, characteristics and distress.
PG  - 1326-36
AB  - The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) is a new patient-rated instrument 
      that was developed to provide multidimensional information about a diverse group 
      of common symptoms. This study evaluated the reliability and validity of the MSAS 
      in the cancer population. Randomly selected inpatients and outpatients (n = 246) 
      with prostate, colon, breast or ovarian cancer were assessed using the MSAS and a 
      battery of measures that independently evaluate phenomena related to quality of 
      life. Symptom prevalence in the 218 evaluable patients ranged from 73.9% for lack 
      of energy to 10.6% for difficulty swallowing. Based on a content analysis, three 
      symptoms were deleted and two were added; the revised scale evaluates 32 physical 
      and psychological symptoms. A factor analysis of variance yielded two factors 
      that distinguished three major symptom groups and several subgroups. The major 
      groups comprised psychological symptoms (PSYCH), high prevalence physical 
      symptoms (PHYS H), and low prevalence physical symptoms (PHYS L). Internal 
      consistency was high in the PHYS H and PSYCH groups (Cronback alpha coefficients 
      of 0.88 and 0.83, respectively), and moderate in the PHYS L group (alpha = 0.58). 
      Although the severity, frequency and distress dimensions were highly 
      intercorrelated, canonical correlations and other analyses demonstrated that 
      multidimensional assessment (frequency and distress) augments information about 
      the impact of symptoms. High correlations with clinical status and quality of 
      life measures support the validity of the MSAS and indicate the utility of 
      several subscale scores, including PSYCH, PHYS, and a brief Global Distress 
      Index. The MSAS is a reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of symptom 
      prevalence, characteristics and distress. It provides a method for comprehensive 
      symptom assessment that may be useful when information about symptoms is 
      desirable, such as clinical trials that incorporate quality of life measures or 
      studies of symptom epidemiology.

TI  - The influence of depression, social activity, and family stress on functional 
      outcome after stroke.
PG  - 1478-83
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was designed to assess the quality of life 
      after an active poststroke period of rehabilitation and to investigate the 
      possibility of a return to a working environment for those still of working age. 
      METHODS: The study was conducted on 180 consecutive patients affected by stroke 
      who were hospitalized for the first time and discharged at least 1 year before 
      the study. The group consisted of 65% men and 35% women with a mean age 65.29 
      years (SD, 11.22). The period between the stroke and the interview ranged from 12 
      to 196 months, with a mean of 37.5 months. The average Rankin score on discharge 
      from the rehabilitation center was 2.718 (moderate handicap). The interview took 
      place at home after consent obtained by telephone. The questionnaire included 
      general and personal information regarding the individuals, their socioeconomic 
      position, and scales for daily activity, depression, social activity, and stress 
      produced in the family. The control group consisted of 167 age-matched subjects. 
      RESULTS: A close correlation was observed in all patients between depression, 
      social activity, and stress caused to relatives. The scores on the individual 
      scales were clearly worse than those for control subjects. The patients received 
      approximately 5 months of rehabilitation after the stroke. Differences emerged 
      between men and women for depression and social activities, with the women 
      scoring worse. In reference to daily life, 70% of prestroke ability was required 
      on average after rehabilitation. The daily activity score at the time of the 
      interview was also strongly influenced by the discharge score. The majority of 
      patients were retired. Of the total, 20.64% returned to work, but not always to 
      the same job and often after readapting to new conditions. Of this population, 
      only 31.5% were women. With regard to the population aged younger than 65 years, 
      21.42% returned to work. Lesions in the dominant hemisphere do not necessarily 
      seem to rule out return to work, even if associated with aphasia. The main 
      discriminating element was the ability to understand language. The patients were 
      often criticized by their cohabitants; the criticisms most often raised concerned 
      apathy, irritability, and self-centeredness. Sexual activity was depressed in 
      almost all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the progress made in studying cerebral 
      vasculopathies, patients in the aftermath of a stroke still seem to live 
      unsatisfactorily, as they did many years ago. Useful measures include valid 
      treatment against spasticity, psychological assistance, and greater social 
      support.

TI  - Nonparticipation in mammography screening: apathy, anxiety or cost?
PG  - 284-6
AB  - AIMS: A survey was undertaken to find out why only 46% of eligible women had 
      taken the opportunity to join the South Canterbury mammography screening 
      programme in the first 22 months of operation. METHODS: One hundred and sixty 
      seven randomly chosen women, aged between 40 and 65 years, who had not had a 
      mammogram, were questioned about their knowledge of, and attitudes to, 
      mammography screening. RESULTS: The answers showed that apathy, lack of concern 
      and lack of perceived need were reasons quoted for nonattendance by almost half 
      of respondents. Other important barriers to mammography screening were: (1) fear 
      of a positive screen result (admitted by 39%); (2) lack of encouragement by some 
      general practitioners (quoted by 19%); and (3) lack of knowledge about screening 
      mammography (one third did not know that mammography was a screening and not just 
      a diagnostic procedure). The current cost is a major deterrent for many 
      unscreened women with only 28% saying they would be willing to pay more than 
      $55.00, but only 10% unwilling to pay at all and only 5% quoting cost as their 
      reason for nonattendance. CONCLUSION: Strategies to improve attendance are 
      suggested.

TI  - The sources of convergence between measures of apathy and depression.
PG  - 117-24
AB  - Apathy and depression are discriminable but related dimensions of behavior. The 
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the source of the overlap between measures 
      of apathy and depression. We evaluated the intercorrelations between the Apathy 
      Evaluation Scale (AES) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HamD) in 107 
      subjects, aged 53-85, who met research criteria for normal aging, left or right 
      cerebral hemisphere stroke, probable Alzheimer's disease, or major depression. We 
      determined the correlation between the individual items on the HamD and the total 
      scores on the AES and the HamD. The HamD items having the strongest correlations 
      with AES total score were diminished work/interest, psychomotor retardation, 
      anergy, and lack of insight. The correlation between AES and HamD total scores 
      was nonsignificant when major depression subjects and these variables most 
      closely related to apathy were excluded from consideration. These findings 
      indicate that the convergence between HamD and AES is attributable to (i) a 
      subset of HamD items which are consistent with the syndrome of apathy and (ii) 
      the fact that major depression is associated with both apathy and depression. 
      Clinical and research applications of these results are discussed.

TI  - Emotional distress and fatigue in coronary heart disease: the Global Mood Scale 
      (GMS).
PG  - 111-21
AB  - Evidence indicates that emotional distress has a long-term impact on morbidity 
      and mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), and that symptoms of 
      depression, fatigue, and reduced energy may identify high-risk patients. This 
      study was designed to: (1) devise a sound and practical measure of emotional 
      distress in CHD patients; (2) examine the relationship between emotional distress 
      and fatigue following CHD; and (3) examine changes in emotional distress as a 
      function of cardiac rehabilitation. A sample of 478 men with CHD (mean age = 57.8 
      +/- 8.7 y) filled out questionnaires 3-6 weeks following a myocardial infarction 
      (N = 110), bypass surgery (N = 302), or coronary angioplasty (N = 66). 
      Statistical analyses of 56 Dutch mood terms were used to produce the 20-item 
      Global Mood Scale (GMS) which measures negative affect (characterized by fatigue 
      and malaise), as well as positive affect (characterized by energy and 
      sociability), in patients with CHD. The GMS was found to be a reliable scale 
      (alpha > 0.90; r > 0.55 over a 3-month period), and correlations with existing 
      measures of emotional functioning and self-deception indicated its convergent and 
      discriminant validity. Most importantly, fatigue was not related to 
      cardiorespiratory fitness in a subset of 140 patients, but clearly was associated 
      with negative affect. Consistent with the self-efficacy model, scores on the GMS 
      mood scales improved significantly as a function of rehabilitation (P < 0.0001). 
      Although symptoms of emotional distress are easily explained away by situational 
      factors, previous research suggests that failure to recognize the clinical 
      significance of these symptoms in CHD patients may result in the delay of much 
      needed intervention. The current findings suggest that the GMS is a theoretically 
      and psychometrically sound measure of emotional distress in CHD patients, and 
      that this scale is sufficiently sensitive to assess change.

TI  - A methodology for collecting outcome measures for common hospital conditions.
PG  - 380-4
AB  - An eight-month prospective analysis of routinely collected hospital data with 
      24-week follow-up of mortality and morbidity was carried out at two district 
      general hospitals in Somerset Health District, to test the feasibility of 
      collecting useful and valid outcome measures for two common hospital conditions, 
      strokes and fractured hips. Data were collected on 163 consecutive admissions 
      with a primary diagnosis of stroke (83 cases) or fractured hip (80 cases). At 24 
      weeks, 38 patients with stroke had died (mortality ratio 46 per cent, 95 per cent 
      C.I. = 35.3-56.7 per cent) and 11 with fractured hip had died (mortality ratio 14 
      per cent, 95 per cent C.I. = 6.4-21.6 per cent). Seven patients (four with 
      fractured hip and three with stroke) died after 24 weeks and before responding to 
      the NHP questionnaire. One stroke patient could not be traced. Nottingham Health 
      Profiles were received from 106 patients (41 with stroke and 65 with fractured 
      hip). Both groups of patients had problems with physical mobility and lack of 
      energy. Patients with fractured hips were more likely to complain of pain. It is 
      concluded that the methods used to collect outcome measures in this study are 
      widely applicable to other conditions, but the interpretation and comparability 
      of the results require the collection of similar data elsewhere.

TI  - Reliability, validity, and clinical correlates of apathy in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 134-9
AB  - The authors examined a consecutive series of 50 patients for the presence of 
      apathy, depression, anxiety, and neuropsychological deficits using a 
      neuropsychological battery that included a recently designed apathy scale. This 
      scale was found to be reliable and valid in the diagnosis of apathy in patients 
      with PD. Of patients in the study, 12% showed apathy as their primary psychiatric 
      problem, and 30% were both apathetic and depressed. Patients with apathy (with or 
      without depression), showed significantly more deficits in both tasks of verbal 
      memory and time-dependent tasks. Results suggest that apathy is a frequent 
      finding in PD, is significantly associated with specific cognitive impairments, 
      and may have a different mechanism than depression.

TI  - Behavioral syndromes in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 161-84
AB  - The Behavioral Syndromes Scale for Dementia (BSSD) is a new instrument that 
      showed strong internal consistency and interrater reliability in an outpatient 
      sample of 106 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease. Factor analysis 
      provided support for a priori symptom groupings, particularly the syndromes of 
      disinhibition and apathy-indifference. Dependency (87%), denial of illness (63%), 
      and motor agitation (55%) were common, while sexual disinhibition (2.9%) and 
      self-destructive behaviors (2.9%) were rare. Virtually all symptoms were 
      predominantly minimal to mild in severity. Patients with longer illness duration 
      were more apathetic. Disinhibited behaviors and apathy-indifference increased 
      with greater severity of dementia. Catastrophic reactions, aggression, and 
      agitation were associated with greater functional impairment. There was great 
      heterogeneity in symptom presentation. In Alzheimer's disease, several behavioral 
      changes might be direct manifestations of underlying brain pathology, rather than 
      being solely secondary to cognitive impairment.

TI  - Predictors of behavioral disturbance in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - P362-71
AB  - The relationship of behavioral disturbances in Alzheimer's disease to disease 
      severity, age at onset, and the presence of extrapyramidal signs was investigated 
      in three studies. Five categories of behavior disturbance were ascertained 
      through structured interview with the patient's primary caregiver: apathy, 
      agitation, psychotic symptoms, disinhibition, and irritability. In Study 1, 
      measures of disease severity accounted for 42% of the variance in the Apathy 
      scale but less than 20% of the variance in the remaining scales. In Study 2, the 
      presence of extrapyramidal signs was associated with increased Apathy and 
      moderated the association between disease severity and the Psychotic Symptoms and 
      Irritability scales. In Study 3, age at onset was associated with the Agitation 
      scale and moderated the association between disease severity and the Apathy, 
      Psychotic Symptoms, and Irritability scales. The findings are discussed in terms 
      of the clinical heterogeneity within Alzheimer's disease, the possible biological 
      bases of these behavioral disturbances, and the psychometric issues pertinent to 
      their measurement.

PG  - 459-63
AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop and test a new beta-Blocker Visual 
      Analog Scale designed to identify and quantify the impact that the side effects 
      of beta-blocker therapy have on people's lives, and the self-management practices 
      people use to mediate their influence. Instruments included the 20-item 
      beta-Blocker Visual Analog Scale and the Profile of Mood States. Subjects had 
      hypertension; 51 men were involved in a larger study involving antihypertensive 
      medications and exercise, and 19 men and women were receiving beta-blocker 
      therapy as first-line drug of choice. Estimates of internal consistency 
      reliability, content validity, and concurrent and discriminant validity were 
      moderately strong. The most problematic side effects were related to lack of 
      sleep, vivid or active dreams, lack of energy and pep, diminished interest in 
      sexual activity, and changes in vision. Among self-management practices used to 
      mediate side effects were planning rest and activity periods, thinking carefully 
      before reacting, and seeking out others for support.

TI  - Reliability and validity of the Apathy Evaluation Scale.
PG  - 143-62
AB  - This article presents evidence for the reliability and construct validity of the 
      Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). Conceptually, apathy is defined as lack of 
      motivation not attributable to diminished level of consciousness, cognitive 
      impairment, or emotional distress. Operationally, the AES treats apathy as a 
      psychological dimension defined by simultaneous deficits in the overt behavioral, 
      cognitive, and emotional concomitants of goal-directed behavior. Three versions 
      of the AES (clinician, informant, and self-rated) were evaluated for 123 
      subjects, ages 53-85, meeting research criteria for right or left hemisphere 
      stroke, probable Alzheimer's disease, major depression, or well elderly control. 
      Multiple forms of reliability (internal consistency, test-retest, and interrater) 
      were satisfactory. Several types of validity evidence are presented for each 
      version of the scale, including the following: ability of the AES to discriminate 
      between groups according to mean levels of apathy, discriminability of apathy 
      ratings from standard measures of depression and anxiety, convergent validity 
      between the three versions of the scale, and predictive validity measures derived 
      from observing subjects' play with novelty toys and videogames. Guidelines for 
      the administration of the AES are presented, along with suggestions for potential 
      applications of the scale to clinical and research questions.

TI  - Proposed factor structure of the Geriatric Depression Scale.
PG  - 23-8
AB  - The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is commonly used to measure depression in 
      the elderly. However, there have been no reports of the underlying structure of 
      the GDS. To this end, the GDS was administered to 326 community-dwelling elderly 
      subjects, and the data were subjected to a factor analysis. A five-factor 
      solution was selected and, after a varimax rotation, the factors that emerged 
      could be described as: (1) sad mood, (2) lack of energy, (3) positive mood, (4) 
      agitation, and (5) social withdrawal. This solution accounted for 42.9% of the 
      variance. Knowledge of the factor structure should aid both clinicians and 
      researchers in the interpretation of responses on the GDS.

TI  - Mood disorders in the year after first stroke.
PG  - 83-92
AB  - An unselected community sample of 128 patients were studied over the 12 months 
      after their first stroke, and compared with a control sample of subjects from the 
      general population. Psychiatric status was assessed using the PSE and BDI. 
      Symptoms of mood disorder were commoner in the stroke patients than the controls, 
      but the differences were not substantial and had largely disappeared by 12 
      months. Psychiatric problems encountered included agoraphobia, social withdrawal, 
      apathy and self-neglect, irritability and pathological emotionalism. While there 
      was a high cumulative incidence of psychiatric disorder, little of it persisted: 
      only two cases of major depression were present for the whole 12 months. We 
      believe undue emphasis has been placed in the recent literature on major 
      depression as a specific syndrome following stroke.

TI  - Prediction of independent functioning and behavior problems in geriatric 
      patients.
PG  - 1304-10
AB  - Folstein's Mini Mental State Exam, a test assessing the capacity to perform novel 
      and/or repetitive motor tasks (Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale) and a brief measure 
      of working memory were used in a sample of 50 male Veterans Affairs geriatric 
      clinic patients who ranged in age from 63 to 105 (mean, 80.1). The purpose of 
      this study was to attempt to predict the patients' capacity to regulate their 
      behavior independently. We hypothesized that frontal lobe disorders often impair 
      a patient's ability to function autonomously and that the Behavioral Dyscontrol 
      Scale, a measure of frontal lobe impairment, would best predict the capacity for 
      independent regulation of purposeful behavior. Therefore, we examined the 
      relationship of the Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale with spouses' and caregivers' 
      ratings of patients' independent living skills, and with behaviors that interfere 
      with independent functioning. The results of hierarchial regression analyses 
      indicated that the Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale was the only predictor of 
      functional autonomy and was the best predictor of both impulsivity and apathy 
      among geriatric patients. The Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale appears to assess a 
      different functional domain than do the MMSE and similar measures, which rely 
      heavily on the evaluation of orientation and gross cognitive status.

TI  - [Participation of regional inhabitants in cancer screening].
PG  - 559-68
AB  - As part of the strategic planning for increasing participation by community 
      residents in cancer screening, a survey about life style and attitudes toward 
      cancer screening was carried out in Samukawa town, Kanagawa Prefecture. Subjects 
      were males 40 years old or over, and females 30 years old or over selected by 
      random sampling from residents. Number of subjects was 1,916 (822 males, 1,094 
      females). Self administered anonymous questionnaires were sent and returned by 
      mail. The response rate was 73%. The results were as follows: (1) The reported 
      participation rates for cancer screening under "the Health and Medical Services 
      Law for the Aged" did not reflect the actual participation rate of residents. (2) 
      The major reason for not participation in screening was lack of interest in 
      cancer prevention. (3) Socio-economic status of regular participants in screening 
      was different from persons who did not participate. (4) Persons who did not 
      participate in screening were more passive with regard to obtaining knowledge of 
      cancer than regular participants. (5) Results of this study show that cancer 
      prevention education at various levels such as by clinical offices, TV and radio 
      programs, and newspapers may be effective. In order to increase participation in 
      screening programs, health education that considers the life style 
      characteristics of persons who do not participate in the screening programs is 
      vitally important.

TI  - Organic personality disorder in dementia syndromes: an inventory approach.
PG  - 261-7
AB  - Personality alterations were investigated in patients with dementia of the 
      Alzheimer type (DAT), multi-infarct dementia (MID), and normal control subjects, 
      using a standardized informant-rated personality inventory. Personality 
      alterations were observed in all patients, and the two diagnostic groups 
      exhibited many similar behavioral alterations. DAT patients had significantly 
      greater alterations in maturity and exhibited less personal control compared with 
      the MID patients; the latter manifested more apathy and remained more 
      affectionate and easy-going. Few correlations were found between the severity of 
      dementia and the magnitude of behavioral changes. Personality alterations are an 
      important and consistent aspect of the phenomenology of dementing disorders.

TI  - Validity and reliability of the dementia behavior disturbance scale.
PG  - 221-6
AB  - Behavioral disturbance is a common and distinctive feature of Alzheimer's disease 
      and other dementias. Existing instruments designed to quantify behavior 
      disturbance among patients with dementia tend to be quite heterogeneous, 
      including many items that do not refer to behavioral disturbance as such, but 
      rather to cognitive, psychological, or somatic symptoms, or functional 
      impairments. A 28-item Dementia Behavior Disturbance (DBD) scale was developed to 
      avoid some of the problems encountered with the older instruments. In two samples 
      of patients with dementia (n = 50 and n = 46), the most common symptoms were 
      repetitive questions, losing or hiding things, lack of interest in daily 
      activities, nocturnal wakefulness, unwarranted accusations, excessive daytime 
      sleeping, and pacing. The coefficient of internal consistency was greater than 
      .80 in both samples, and the correlation between scores obtained from the same 
      subjects at a two-week interval was moderately high (Pearson's correlation 
      coefficient = .71). There was a relatively high correlation between DBD scores 
      and scores on Greene's Behavior and Mood Disturbance scale, and higher DBD scores 
      were associated with increased duration and severity of disease. These 
      preliminary results indicate that the DBD may be a useful and valid measure of 
      one dimension of the dementia syndrome.

TI  - Measurement and prediction of functional capacity in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 8-14
AB  - Functional loss in Alzheimer's disease is difficult to measure or predict. The 
      Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (Part 1) correlates well with postmortem changes 
      but is not an effective antemortem index of functional change since disparate 
      behavioral domains are assessed. We performed a factor analysis of the Blessed 
      items in 187 patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and 
      identified 4 independent factors: (I) cognitive, (II) personality, (III) apathy, 
      and (IV) basic self-care. An endpoint, consisting of a score indicative of 
      moderate disability, was determined for each factor. We then used life table 
      analyses to compare the probability of reaching these endpoints over time in 
      longitudinally followed patients. Patients with extrapyramidal signs at their 
      initial visit reached the factor IV endpoint sooner, and those with psychosis or 
      no family history of dementia also reached the factor I endpoint faster. These 
      data illustrate the utility of a multifactorial approach to the assessment of 
      functional capacity in Alzheimer's disease, and also indicate that extrapyramidal 
      symptoms and psychosis are powerful predictors of the rate of decline in basic 
      self-care activities and cognition.

      disease.
PG  - 1174-8
AB  - A structured interview covering the DSM-III criteria for major depression was 
      adapted for separate use with Alzheimer's disease patients and with their 
      families. Data from 36 patients yielded a depression rate of 13.9%, whereas 
      information from their families indicated that the rate was 50.0%. This 
      disagreement reflected greater family endorsement of patients' loss of interest 
      or pleasure, irritability, fatigue, and feelings of worthlessness. Use of 
      DSM-III-R criteria narrowed but did not eliminate the discrepancy between 
      patients' and families' assessments of the patients' depression. Uniform 
      procedures for gathering and integrating data from the family that are relevant 
      to diagnosis in this group are indicated.

TI  - The stressors and the post-traumatic stress syndrome after an industrial 
      disaster.
PG  - 25-37
AB  - Acute and subacute post-traumatic stress reactions are reported among 246 
      employees of an industrial factory which was severely damaged by an explosion and 
      fire. Sixty-six A-subjects had narrow escape experiences (high stress exposure 
      group), while 59 B-subjects were less severely exposed (medium stress exposure 
      group). The 121 C-subjects were not present at work when the explosion occurred 
      (low stress exposure group). A response rate of 97.6% was achieved at the primary 
      examination, and a 100% response at the 7 months follow-up. The frequency and 
      intensity of post-traumatic stress reactions were linked to the severity (A,B,C) 
      of the stress exposure; specific post-traumatic anxiety reactions reported by 
      more than 80% of A-subjects. The reactions appeared immediately or within hours, 
      only 5% of A had delays of a few weeks. While 24.3% of A had State Anxiety 
      Inventory scores 1 week post-disaster higher than 60, 8.5% of B and 2.5% of C had 
      similar scores. Depressive reactions, social withdrawal, guilt, shame and 
      irritability were less frequent, and appeared nearly always concomitant with 
      anxiety symptoms. While the anxiety symptoms made up a tight knit syndrome, the 
      less frequent non-anxiety symptoms were linked to the post-traumatic anxiety 
      syndrome. The subjects' fears reflected the trauma, they feared inanimate 
      objects, and there were hardly any paranoid ideations. The disaster exposure of 
      the A and B but not of the C group members constituted a stressor which fulfilled 
      the PTSD stressor criterion of the DSM III R. A minority of the C group developed 
      a post-traumatic stress syndrome. After 7 months, all 30 post-traumatic stress 
      reactions were more frequent and severe in the A than B group which again 
      differed from the C group. Irritability was the only post-traumatic stress 
      reaction that increased in frequency and intensity during the 7 months 
      observation period. The findings represent evidence that supports the face 
      validity, descriptive and construct validity of the PTSD diagnosis.

      female and 85% black or Hispanic. The response rate of completed interviews was 
      65% for the Zung SDS and 100% for the Short-CARE. Among the reasons indicated by 
      subjects for not filling out the Zung SDS were visual problems (n = 13, 28%), 
      illiteracy (n = 4, 9%), and lack of motivation/wanted it read to them (n = 16, 
      34%). Additionally, using the Primary Care Physicians' Questionnaire (PCPQ), 
      results from the Short-CARE and the Zung SDS were compared to primary care 
      physicians' judgments regarding the presence of depression in these patients. The 
      convergent validity coefficient for the Zung SDS with the PCPQ was .65 (kappa = 
      .29); the comparable coefficients for the PCPQ and the Short-CARE Depression 
      Scale were .73 and .46 respectively.

TI  - Symptoms of depression in old people in Finland.
PG  - 257-63
AB  - The study describes common symptoms of depression and age and sex differences in 
      these symptoms in elderly Finns. The symptoms were assessed on the basis of the 
      22-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), and comparisons were made 
      between the symptoms of those diagnosed as depressed and those diagnosed as not 
      depressed in clinical investigations. The most common symptoms in depressed men 
      were general somatic symptoms, initial insomnia, loss of interest in work and 
      activities, middle insomnia, and depressed mood. In depressed women, the most 
      common symptoms were psychic anxiety, general somatic symptoms, initial insomnia, 
      loss of interest in work and activities, and depressed mood. In both these groups 
      the lowest occurrences were found for compulsory symptoms, paranoid symptoms and 
      depersonalization. The symptomatology was most severe in the oldest age group: 
      depressed mood and many somatic symptoms were more common in depressed older male 
      and female age groups than in younger groups. Sex comparisons showed that many 
      symptoms were more severe in depressed women than in depressed men: depressed 
      mood, feelings of guilt, psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety and diurnal variation 
      of symptoms were more common in depressed women. Retardation was the only symptom 
      that was more common in depressed men. Loss of libido did not belong to the 
      symptomatology of depression in the oldest female age group, but in men and in 
      younger female age group it could in some cases indicate occurrence of 
      depression.

TI  - Clinician-rated symptoms and signs of depression in aged Finns.
PG  - 274-84
AB  - The study describes symptoms and signs of depression in elderly (60 years or 
      over) Finns. Lists of symptoms and signs assessed by the examining physicians in 
      a population study were used in rating, and the symptoms and signs of persons 
      diagnosed as depressed were compared to those of persons who were not depressed. 
      The commonest symptoms both in men and women were sleep disturbances, 
      fatiguability, loss of interest, depressed mood, loss of activity, pains, 
      pessimism and sense of uselessness. In addition, worry was a common symptom in 
      women. Hallucinations and other delusions than those about unforgivable behaviour 
      were very uncommon. Loss of libido did not strongly indicate occurrence of 
      depression, and in persons aged 70 years or over it could not be included in 
      symptoms of depression. Sex differences in the commonest symptoms of depression 
      were evident: worry, crying spells, helplessness, loneliness, suicidal ideas and 
      pains were more common in depressed women than in depressed men. Some age 
      differences in symptoms were also found both in men and in women. Sad expression 
      was a common sign of depression in both sexes. In addition, slow movements, 
      scarcity of gestures and slow speech were quite common signs in depressed men and 
      stooping posture was quite common in depressed women.

TI  - Self-reported physical stress reactions: first- and second-order factors.
PG  - 215-27
AB  - Stress Inventory-6, a 72-item self-report questionnaire designed to tap 18 
      factors of physical stress reactions, was subjected to factor analysis. The 
      instrument was given to 474 students (254 females, 206 males, and 14 who failed 
      to indicate their gender). The final factor solution identified 16 first-order 
      and 4 second-order factors. The first-order solution replicated most of the 
      factors identified in a previous study and defined factors in terms of organ 
      system, muscle group, and simple content. In the second-order solution, Factors 
      I, III, and IV include symptoms that are immediate and direct, appear to be 
      related to arousal of the somatic and sympathetic nervous system, and are marked 
      prominently by cardiorespiratory activity. In contrast, Factor II includes 
      symptoms that are indirect and often delayed consequences of sustained arousal 
      (Fatigue and Lack of Energy, Headaches, Backaches, etc.). A major distinction can 
      be made between stress arousal Factors I and III. Factor III appears to be a 
      simple "fight or flight" arousal pattern characterized by fairly direct 
      manifestations of striated muscle tension as well as cardiorespiratory activity. 
      In contrast, Factor I is a complex arousal pattern characterized by diffuse 
      autonomic arousal, self-directed attention, and possibly low self-esteem. The 
      results of this study draw into question the extent to which popular stress 
      inventories tap a representative sample of stress symptoms. Clinical implications 
      are discussed.

TI  - Replicated evidence on the construct validity of the SCAG (Sandoz Clinical 
      Assessment-Geriatric) scale.
PG  - 293-306
AB  - Factor analysis procedures, applied to a data bank of 1165 senile patients from 
      21 double-blind studies, yielded 5 factors: cognitive dysfunction (4 items), 
      interpersonal relationships (4 items), apathy (4 items), affect (3 items) and 
      somatic function (3 items). A retrospective review of the 1165 case histories 
      revealed that patients fell into three distinct diagnostic classes: (a) patients 
      whose symptoms of dementia were likely associated with multiple infarcts; (b) 
      patients with other medical disorders such as metabolic imbalances, pulmonary 
      diseases, etc. which may have induced dementia-like symptoms; and (c) primary 
      degenerative dementia for patients with no evidence of other intervening causes. 
      Factor analysis applied independently to the SCAG data of each of the three 
      groups produced similar factor constructs, thereby suggesting that results 
      reported with this instrument are valid across different geriatric diagnostic 
      categories.

TI  - Sex and generational differences in Senior Apperception Technique projections.
PG  - 1299-1304
AB  - A major purpose of this study was to compare the projections of 50 young and 50 
      elderly subjects to the Seniors Apperception Technique. Specifically, the 
      emotional contents of stories told to the test were compared for sex and 
      generational differences. The results showed, in general, that, while the themes 
      contained more negative than positive feelings, many individuals gave unhappy 
      stories happy conclusions. In addition, the projections of elderly and female 
      respondents were more positive than those of younger and male subjects. The 
      findings were interpreted in light of Neugartin's disengagement theory.
