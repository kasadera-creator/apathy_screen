T1  - Symptoms on the first day after discharge from the intensive care unit:A cross-sectional study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1527-3288
Y1  - 2026///Jan-Feb

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on intensive care unit (ICU) patients' symptom experiences shortly after ICU discharge are scarce. OBJECTIVES: To determine prevalence, frequency, severity and distress of symptoms, and to investigate if possible predictive demographic and clinical factors are associated with a high number of symptoms the first day after ICU discharge. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study in Norway, thirty-two symptoms were evaluated in adult ICU survivors using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Data on prevalence (yes/no), frequency and severity (4-point scales) and distress (5-point scales) were collected. Possible associations between selected predictive demographic and clinical factors and having a high number (i.e.≥12) of symptoms were analysed using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The patients (n=155) reported a median of 12 symptoms (range:0-22). Lack of energy and dry mouth were most prevalent (83%). Lack of energy, dry mouth, and difficulty sleeping were most frequent (median=4). Problems with sexual interest/activity (median=3.5), lack of energy, dry mouth, difficulty sleeping, pain, vomiting, feeling sad and worrying were most severe (median=3), and problems with sexual interest/activity (median=4), difficulty sleeping, vomiting, feeling sad and worrying (median=3) were most distressing. Patients admitted to surgical wards were more than twice as likely to report a high number of symptoms (OR=2.23;95% CI [1.08,4.63]) than those admitted to medical wards (p=0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Half of ICU survivors self-reported ≥12 symptoms the first day after ICU discharge. The most prevalent symptoms were not the most distressful, highlighting the need to screen for multiple symptoms and dimensions to provide target symptom relief and optimize rehabilitation.

T1  - Validation of the dimensional apathy scale and predictors of apathy in stroke survivors
LA  - eng
SN  - 2045-2322
Y1  - 2025/11/14
AB  - The study aimed to: (i) translate and culturally adapt the DAS into Persian; (ii) examine the psychometric properties of both the DAS-S and DAS-I; (iii) analyze the three components of both the DAS-S and DAS-I to assess apathy dimensionally; (iv) determine the optimal cut-off points using ROC analysis for the DAS-S, DAS-I, and their subscales; and (v) identify predictors of initiation, emotional, and executive apathy in stroke survivors. This study included 115 stroke survivors and 38 healthy controls. Both DAS versions were evaluated for acceptability, reliability, and validity. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to assess construct validity. Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis was used to determine optimal cut-off points. Multiple regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of apathy. Cronbach's alpha was 0.88 for DAS-S and 0.85 for DAS-I. ICC2,1 was > 0.93 for both versions. Total and subscale scores of both DAS versions showed weak to moderate correlations with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Apathy subscale (r = 0.39-0.69). Principal component analysis showed three components (executive, emotional, and initiation) for DAS-S and DAS-I, explaining 49.26% and 53.02% of the variance, respectively. The optimal cut-off was 31 for DAS-S (88.89% sensitivity, 86.36% specificity) and 29 for DAS-I (92.52% sensitivity, 86.36% specificity). Depression was the strongest predictor of executive subscale scores of both DAS versions, as well as the initiation subscale of the DAS-S, explaining 33.90-48.90% of the variance. However, for the emotional subscale of both DAS versions, the strongest predictor was the level of daily activity. The two versions of DAS effectively identify apathy subtypes and are reliable and valid for assessing apathy in stroke survivors. They effectively discriminate between apathetic and non-apathetic stroke survivors. Depression is the strongest predictor of executive and initiation apathy, whereas functional indicators-particularly independence in activities of daily living-predict emotional apathy.

AB  - AIMS: In low back pain (LBP) research, recovery is commonly used as an outcome measure. However, there is no method used to measure recovery or acceptable definition for recovery. This research aims to investigate patients' perceptions of recovery from LBP. MATERIALS & METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in which 350 patients with chronic LBP participated. Demographic and clinical information was collected by a comprehensive and inclusive questionnaire. A checklist of improvement indicators was given to the patients and completed by them. It was aimed to identify the most important criteria for recovery in patients with chronic LBP. RESULTS: The results showed that pain reduction alone is not a reliable indicator of recovery. The patients' view about the recovery from chronic LBP includes a wide range of factors in different areas of symptomatic improvement, fear of recurrence injury, functional disability, fatigue and reduced energy level. Also, a significant correlation was observed between recovery indicators and pain duration, body mass index, and pain intensity in patients with chronic LBP. CONCLUSIONS: The framework of recovery for patients with chronic LBP is complicated and is a highly individual structure. It is determined by the impact of symptoms on activities of daily living factors.

T1  - Behavioral subtypes impact prognosis and survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a clustering-based approach
LA  - eng
SN  - 2167-9223
Y1  - 2025/11/
ET  - 2025/08/21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioral impairments are well established in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A refined understanding of the contribution of delineated patterns of behavioral impairments to prognosis is vitally important. METHODS: Leveraging data-driven two-step cluster analysis, we first stratified a large cross-sectional cohort of 170 ALS patients into distinct phenotypic subtypes based on their baseline behavioral profiles, as determined by the well-validated and informant-rated Motor Neuron Disease Behavioral Instrument (MiND-B). Mixed-effects model and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to compare rate of functional decline as measured by the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) over follow-up assessments in 121 participants, as well as survival duration (n = 130), between the behavioral subtypes. Results: Clustering analysis yielded three behavioral phenotypes characterized by 1) intact behavioral functioning (n = 125), 2) apathy alone (n = 20), and 3) concurrent disinhibition and stereotypical behavior (n = 25). Apathy was associated with both significantly shorter survival (p = .003) and most rapid functional decline across follow-up assessments (both p <.001). Importantly, this pervasive effect was not observed in other behavioral cluster groups. CONCLUSIONS: Extending previous cross-sectional work, current findings offer delineation of the trajectory of clinical outcomes associated with classic behavioral phenotypes of ALS. Converging with past evidence of unique disease and progression profile in ALS patients with apathy, our work provides strong support for behavioral change and in particular apathy as a reliable indicator of poor prognosis across cross-sectional and longitudinal markers of clinical outcomes.

T1  - How demoralization is related to trait resilience factors: a network analysis in a representative sample of the general population
LA  - eng
SN  - 1471-244X
Y1  - 2025/10/13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Demoralization refers to a mental state of poor coping characterized by a loss of purpose and meaning, feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, and suicidal ideation. The revised demoralization scale (DS-II) is among the most frequently used self-report measures. Recently, the psychometric properties and normative values of the DS-II-Ms (Münster version of the DS-II) were published, alongside a validation study linking it to depression and anxiety in the general population. This study investigates the relationship between DS-II-Ms scores and resilience, as well as well-validated trait resilience factors, specifically locus of control and general self-efficacy, using a network psychometrics approach. METHODS: DS-II-Ms, Patient Health Questionnaire 2 (PHQ-2), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale 2 (GAD-2), Internal-External Locus of Control Short Scale-4 (IE4), General Self-Efficacy Short Scale-3 (GSE-3) and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) were applied to a representative sample (N = 2401) of the German general population. A gaussian graphical model was estimated using a non-regularized algorithm to depict the unique connections between the measures. RESULTS: DS-II-Ms was moderately associated with lower internal (and higher external) locus of control while being conditionally independent from BRS and GSE-3. Conversely, depression symptoms lack of interest/low mood were connected to resilience and general self-efficacy but conditionally independent from locus of control. CONCLUSIONS: Although the cross-sectional study design limits directional interpretation, our findings indicate that trait resilience measures have unique associations with demoralization and depression/anxiety symptoms, supporting the discriminant validity of the demoralization construct. Depressed and demoralized individuals might benefit from different therapeutical approaches, targeting specific resilience factors.

T1  - Factors associated with improved curvature outcomes with collagenase clostridium histolyticum for Peyronie's disease: results from a large prospective series
LA  - eng
SN  - 1743-6109
Y1  - 2025/10/05
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since its release in 2014, collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) has become the most commonly used injectable therapy for Peyronie's disease (PD). While some studies have suggested modest improvements in curvature with use of CCH, others have found more significant gains. AIM: To determine predictors of improved curvature in men with PD treated with CCH. METHODS: A prospective, sequential database has been maintained of all men with PD undergoing CCH injections since 2014. Clinical characteristics and responses to standardized and nonstandardized questionnaires were collected at baseline, during, and after treatment. OUTCOMES: Change in curvature was assessed using the "Most Recent" curvature assessment, and statistical analyses were performed to identify factors that correlated with greater curve improvements. RESULTS: A total of 826 men underwent at least one CCH series and comprise the current cohort. Univariate analysis demonstrated associations between greater curvature improvements in patients with more severe baseline curvature (0.5° greater improvement per increase in 1° baseline), hourglass deformities (3-10° greater improvement among moderate/severe men), number of CCH series administered (0-4° per series), strong nocturnal erections (11° higher), greater frequency of intercourse (0.6° per intercourse attempt per month), greater bother and psychological impact (as assessed by the Peyronie's Disease Questionnaire), and those who used RestoreX (5-20° depending on test). Worse outcomes were observed among men who self-reported decreased motivation (7°) as well as those with pure lateral curvatures (11°). Men who experienced hematomas, a popping sensation, and those with rapid detumescence during treatment also had more significant improvements in curvature (5°). On multivariate analysis, baseline curvature, lateral curve direction, hourglass/indentation deformities, RestoreX use, and suspected controlled penile fracture remained independently associated with better outcomes. Of all the factors assessed, RestoreX use was associated with the largest degree of improvement. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: These findings highlight several potential predictors of improved outcomes with CCH, which may be utilized by providers to help counsel patients deciding on medical versus surgical treatment of PD. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: The strengths include the largest single-center prospective database of PD patients undergoing CCH published to date and use of objective and validated instruments to track PD outcomes. Limitations include the single-center nature, diverse patient cohort, and change in CCH technique over time. CONCLUSION: Several baseline and treatment-related factors correlate with CCH outcomes. These data may assist both patients and providers as they relate to patient selection and counseling. The data also suggest the importance of patient motivation and active participation during the treatment course.

T1  - Validation of the Russian version of the Adult Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (A-RSQ): Factor structure and associations with psychological constructs
LA  - eng

Y1  - 2025/10/
ET  - 2025/09/15
AB  - This study aimed to translate and validate the Russian version of the Adult Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (A-RSQ). A total of 407 Russian-speaking adults (53.3 % men; aged 18-74, M = 40.89, SD = 11.03) completed the A-RSQ and a battery of psychological scales, including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21, Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation, Hikikomori Questionnaire-25, Existential Isolation Scale, and Emotional Dysregulation Scale. For factor-structure validation, the sample was randomly split into EFA (n = 213) and CFA (n = 194). Exploratory factor analysis supported a two-factor model (Rejection Concern and Rejection Expectancy), both subscales showing good internal consistency (α ≥.83). Confirmatory factor analysis (WLSMV; ordered-categorical items) showed acceptable incremental fit with elevated RMSEA (CFI =.960, TLI =.954, RMSEA =.095, SRMR =.073) and a negative latent correlation between factors (r = -.44). Test-retest reliability over a four-week interval was acceptable (r = .79). Correlations with external constructs supported convergent validity, revealing distinct associations between A-RSQ components and depression, anxiety, social withdrawal, and interpersonal sensitivity. Exploratory analyses by sex and age revealed that men scored higher on the total A-RSQ and the Rejection Expectancy subscale, while Rejection Expectancy also showed a small age-related decrease. These findings support the use of the Russian A-RSQ as a psychometrically valid instrument for assessing rejection sensitivity and its associations with emotional and interpersonal maladjustment.

T1  - Usefulness of the adult concentration inventory in the psychological assessment of adult sleep disorder patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 1878-5506
Y1  - 2025/10/
ET  - 2025/08/16
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Sleep disorders and Cognitive Disengagement Syndrome (CDS), a persistent condition involving inappropriate cognitive and motor symptoms, can be interconnected. Here, we aimed to evaluate the usefulness of self-reports of adult CDS in sleep disorders population. METHODS: 242 participants (male = 110, 45.5 %; female = 132, 54.5 %) with sleep disorders were consecutively admitted to Sleep Disorder Unit of San Raffaele Turro-Hospital of Milan, Italy. The 16-item version, the 15-item version, and the 10 item versions of the Adult Concentration Inventory (ACI) were administered. We used item response theory (IRT) analyses based on nonparametric graded response model (NGRM) to evaluate the ACI measurement properties. Internal consistency was assessed via Cronbach's alpha coefficients. Associations between ACI scores and clinical variables were examined using correlation and regression analyses. RESULTS: IRT analysis showed that all ACI versions were provided with adequate measurement properties, although in the case of the 10-item version of ACI marginal problems with local independence were observed for two pairs of items. Adequate Cronbach's alpha values were observed for the three ACI versions. All ACI version total scores were significantly and non-negligibly associated with hypersomnia/narcolepsy. In this sub-sample, all ACI scores showed significant and non-trivial relationships with REM sleep latency, whereas only the 10-item ACI total score was significantly related with the number of correct targets on the Clock Task. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that short versions of the ACI may be useful for early detection of the attention difficulties in selected sleep disorders, thus representing a potential help in everyday clinical practice.

T1  - One Word, Many Faces: The Italian Validation of the Multiscale Dissociation Inventory
LA  - eng
SN  - 1529-9740
Y1  - 2025///Oct-Dec
ET  - 2025/08/02
AB  - This study aimed to validate the Italian version of the Multiscale Dissociation Inventory (MDI-ITA) and to assess its psychometric properties in a non-clinical sample. The MDI was translated and culturally adapted following established guidelines. A total of 439 Italian-speaking adults participated in the study and filled out the MDI-ITA and other assessment tools for dissociation depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic symptoms. The internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity of the MDI-ITA were evaluated using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Consistent with previous validation studies, the analyses supported a five-factor structure: Disengagement, Depersonalization/Derealization, Emotional Constriction, Memory Disturbance, and Identity Dissociation. Cronbach's alpha values for each subscale were all greater than 0.71, demonstrating satisfactory internal consistency. Test-retest reliability was also high, with a correlation of 0.91. Convergent validity was supported by significant positive correlations between MDI-ITA and other dissociation measures. Discriminant validity was indicated by weaker correlations with depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptoms. The MDI-ITA is a reliable and valid tool for assessing dissociative phenomena in Italian-speaking populations with potential applications in both clinical and research settings. Its multidimensional structure offers comprehensive insights into dissociation, facilitating the development of targeted interventions for individuals presenting with these symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) occurs in absence of dementia, but no studies explored whether MBI may limit the individuals' ability to complete everyday tasks necessary to live independently. In this study we elucidated on the relevance of specific behavioral markers on functional decline in both cognitively normal (CN) older adults and with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and evaluated whether individuals with MBI present worse cognition and neurodegenerative dysfunctions compared to subjects without MBI. DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional study. SETTING: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. PARTICIPANTS: Amnesic MCI (aMCI; n = 232) participants and CN (n = 418) individuals. MEASUREMENTS: Neuropsychological assessment, volumetric MR brain scan, Flortaucipir PET for in vivo assessment of regional tau deposition, functional assessment questionnaire (FAQ), and neuropsychiatric inventory. RESULTS: MBI occurred in 53.5% aMCI and 19.6% CN. In aMCI, the most prevalent behaviors were affective dysregulation (34.4%), impulse dyscontrol (30.6%), and decreased drive/motivation (15.9%), whereas affective dysregulation (13.1%) and impulse dyscontrol (10.2%) were most prevalent in CN. In aMCI, affective dysregulation, decreased drive, social inappropriateness and abnormal perception MBI domains significantly predicted the FAQ score, whereas only decreased drive/motivation MBI domain showed a predicted role on FAQ in CN. No effects of MBI were detected on regional tau deposition or brain volumes in aMCI. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the occurrence of MBI might predict a high risk of dysfunction in daily life in both aMCI and CN. An early detection of functional impairment may improve the success of disease-modifying interventions.

T1  - Patient-Reported Experiences With Long-Term Lifestyle Self-Monitoring in Heart Disease: Mixed Methods Study
LA  - eng
SN  - 2561-326X
Y1  - 2025/09/17
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lifestyle behaviors strongly predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, emphasizing the need for strategies that support sustained lifestyle changes in patients with cardiac disease. Digital health solutions, including wearables, mobile apps, and chatbots, enable self-monitoring of lifestyle behaviors but often face challenges with engagement and usability. While self-monitoring systems can increase awareness and accountability, maintaining user engagement remains crucial for their effectiveness in promoting behavior change and long-term improvements. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated patient experiences with a lifestyle monitoring system combining a web application, health watch, and chatbot. We explored facilitators of and barriers to long-term adherence and assessed the impact of self-monitoring on lifestyle awareness and behavior change in patients with cardiac disease. METHODS: We conducted a mixed methods study with patients who used an eHealth platform for self-monitoring lifestyle behaviors during 1 year following an invasive cardiac procedure. This study included 100 patients (mean age 61.6, SD 10.4 y; n=88, 88% male) comprising both completers (n=57, 57%) and dropouts (n=43, 43%). Patients engaged in quarterly phone interviews and questionnaires and completed an end-of-study questionnaire. Completers participated in a structured evaluation interview; dropouts provided a reason for discontinuation. Quantitative and qualitative data analyses focused on usability, long-term adherence facilitators and barriers, lifestyle awareness, and behavior change. RESULTS: Patients completed 157 quarterly questionnaires (n=145, 92.4% by completers and n=12, 7.6% by dropouts) and 217 phone interviews (n=171, 78.8% with completers and n=46, 21.2% with dropouts). In total, 77 patients (of whom n=54, 70% were completers and n=23, 30% were dropouts) completed end-of-study questionnaires, and 98% (56/57) of completers participated in the evaluation interviews. Completers reported higher perceptions of the platform's usefulness, ease of use, and satisfaction (P<.001 in all cases) than dropouts. Dropout reasons linked to self-monitoring (34/43, 79%) included high self-report burden and dissatisfaction with the chatbot, poor overall usability experience, health watch technical challenges causing frustration, limited perceived usefulness, mental stress from self-monitoring, and low motivation. Key facilitators of long-term engagement included routine formation, structured reminders, and minimal effort associated with the wearable. Barriers included repetitive chatbot questions (causing cognitive burden) and technical issues with the health watch. Self-monitoring increased lifestyle awareness among completers, particularly regarding physical activity (25/56, 45%) and nutrition (29/56, 52%), with smaller effects for sleep quality (7/56, 13%) and mental stress (1/56, 2%). It facilitated behavior change in physical activity and nutrition (16/56, 29% each) and sleep quality (4/56, 7%) but not in mental stress. Adaptive personalization, mobile accessibility, and real-time feedback could improve adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Fostering routine formation while minimizing patient burden through personalized, flexible, and adaptive features is important for sustained patient engagement in eHealth monitoring systems. Enhancing relevance and usability while reducing complexity and technical barriers can optimize digital health tools and promote lasting behavior change.

T1  - Measuring Apathy Through Computational Lenses: Behavioral and Physiological Signatures of Engagement in Virtual Reality
LA  - eng
SN  - 1545-7214
Y1  - 2025/09/11
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop an objective method for assessing apathy by identifying behavioral clusters based on gaze behavior during an emotionally salient virtual reality (VR) task, and examine associations with apathy severity, cognition, and physiological reactivity. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Memory clinic at a university-affiliated hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-five older adults (mean age 74 ± 5.7 years) with varying cognitive and affective profiles. MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed a naturalistic VR task presenting personalized positive images (e.g., grandchildren), aversive scenes, and neutral stimuli. Eye-tracking data were collected and clustered using unsupervised K-means based on time to first fixation, total fixation duration, and fixation variability. Apathy was assessed using the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS), cognition via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and depression with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Physiological reactivity (heart rate variability measured as root mean square of successive differences [RMSSD], galvanic skin response [GSR], respiration) was analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Two gaze-based subgroups were identified: "Engagers" (n = 48) showed faster, more sustained, and less variable gaze behavior; "Nonengagers" (n = 37) exhibited delayed and more variable gaze responses. Nonengagers were older, had lower MoCA scores, and higher apathy levels. RMSSD was lower overall in nonengagers but increased selectively in response to positive stimuli (grandchildren images). No group differences emerged in GSR or respiration. CONCLUSIONS: Unsupervised clustering of gaze behavior revealed ecologically valid apathy subtypes, linked to cognition and selective RMSSD reactivity. VR-based gaze metrics may offer a scalable, objective tool for detecting motivational impairments in aging.

T1  - Cognitive and neuropsychiatric profiles distinguish atypical parkinsonian syndromes
LA  - eng
SN  - 1460-2156
SN  - 0006-8950
Y1  - 2025/09/03
AB  - Atypical parkinsonian syndromes are distinguished from Parkinson's disease (PD) by additional neurological signs and characteristic underlying neuropathology. However, they can be diagnostically challenging, rapidly progressive and are often diagnosed late in disease course. Their different demographic features and prognoses are well studied, but the accompanying cognitive and psychiatric features may also facilitate diagnosis. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) may cause cognitive and behavioural manifestations that overlap with frontotemporal dementia, including non-fluent aphasia, apathy and impulsivity. Clinical diagnostic criteria have limited sensitivity, with pathologically confirmed PSP often having presented an initial clinical syndrome other than PSP-Richardson's syndrome. Here, we integrate cross-sectional multicentre baseline data from the PROSPECT-M-UK and Oxford Discovery cohorts. This allowed us to compare cognitive and psychiatric features across a total of 1138 people with PSP, CBS, multiple-system atrophy (MSA) and idiopathic PD. Data from the different cohorts were harmonized and compared using multiple linear regression. There were five key results: (i) different syndromes showed distinctive cognitive profiles, using readily applicable 'bedside' screening tools. Frontal executive dysfunction was most evident in PSP, visuospatial deficits in CBS, with milder deficits in memory and executive function in MSA, as compared with PD; (ii) the most prevalent neuropsychiatric features were depression and anxiety in CBS, apathy in PSP, with sleep disturbances common in PD. As expected, apathy correlated positively with impulsivity across all disorders. Neuropsychiatric features were generally better at discriminating between atypical parkinsonian syndromes than were the cognitive domains; (iii) both cognitive function and motor severity declined with disease duration, and motor function predicted cognition in PSP, CBS and PD but not in MSA, suggesting that in MSA cognitive and motor dysfunction are decoupled; (iv) plasma neurofilament light chain (NFL) levels, measured in a subset of patients, correlated with cognitive deficits in PSP, but not motor deficits; (v) cognitive deficits contributed to the impairment in activities of daily living after controlling for motor severity, with every two points on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment worsening the Schwab and England score by one point. In anticipation of future neuroprotective therapies, we present a classifier to improve diagnostic accuracy for atypical parkinsonian syndromes in vivo. Longitudinal cohort studies with resources for neuropathological gold standard diagnosis remain important to validate better diagnostic tools for people with PSP, CBD, MSA and atypical parkinsonism.

T1  - Validation of the Hong Kong version of Abe's behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia score among care home residents with dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 2224-7041
Y1  - 2025/09/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To translate and validate the Hong Kong version of Abe's behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) score (HK-ABS) and examine its psychometric properties among older adults with dementia in Hong Kong care homes, and to examine correlations among BPSD items, patient and caregiver characteristics, and caregiver distress. METHODS: The content validity of the HK-ABS was assessed by a panel of three psychiatrists, one psychiatric nurse, one occupational therapist, and one medical social worker. Concurrent and discriminant validity of the HK-ABS were assessed using the Chinese or Hong Kong version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home (CNPI-NH), the Disability Assessment for Dementia, the Clinical Dementia Rating, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Test-retest reliability and inter-rater reliability were determined. Exploratory factor analysis examined possible constructs by principal component analysis with varimax rotation. Factor extraction was based on Kaiser's eigenvalue criterion. Correlations between the HK-ABS and characteristics of patients and staff caregivers were examined. RESULTS: In total, 109 pairs of patients with major neurocognitive disorder and staff caregivers in care homes were included in the analysis. The median time to complete the HK-ABS was 70 seconds. The median HK-ABS score was 4. Internal consistency of the HK-ABS was good (Cronbach's alpha = 0.787); item-total correlations (excluding 'apathy and indifference') ranged from 0.337 to 0.653. The test-retest reliability (r(s) = 0.981, p = 0.168) and inter-rater reliability (r(s) = 0.987, p = 0.414) of the HK-ABS was excellent. For concurrent validity, the HK-ABS was highly correlated with the CNPI-NH (r(s) = 0.857, p < 0.001). For discriminant validity, the HK-ABS was not correlated with the Chinese or Hong Kong version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (r(s) = 0.103), the Disability Assessment for Dementia (r(s) = -0.039), or the Clinical Dementia Rating (r(s) = 0.067). In exploratory factor analysis, all items achieved factor loadings of >0.4. Three factors explained 70% of the variance. The HK-ABS was negatively correlated with work experience (r(s) = -0.254, p = 0.008) and positively correlated with the length of hospital stay in the previous year (r(s) = 0.193, p = 0.044) and the CNPI-NH occupational disruptive score (r(s) = 0.759, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The HK-ABS is a valid and reliable global assessment tool of BPSD for residential care settings and clinical communication. It may be used to identify caregiver distress to allow for early intervention.

T1  - Neural Representations of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease Continuum Using Pathology-Based Functional Connectivity Analysis
LA  - eng
SN  - 2162-3279
Y1  - 2025/09/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in the Alzheimer's disease continuum affect the quality of life for patients and caregivers. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms of NPS is needed to better understand NPS and enhance patient care. Several studies have investigated them using neuroimaging; however, none have considered the regional coexistence of amyloid-beta and tau pathologies and its association with functional networks. In this study, we aim to identify the neural correlates of NPS considering the molecular and functional levels of neural representation. METHODS: This study included data from amyloid-positive participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database with positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging, NPS scores, and demographic data within one year and categorized them into groups with or without NPS factors. NPS were assessed using the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) and grouped into affective, apathy, hyperactivity, or psychosis factors. Amyloid-beta and tau accumulation measured by PET were compared between groups per region. Differences in functional connectivity of NPS- or NPS-type-specific pathologically altered regions were investigated using seed-to-voxel analysis. Further, a generalized linear model was constructed using the NPI score for each factor as the dependent variable, with functional connectivity strength, tau, and amyloid-beta accumulation as predictors. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in amyloid-beta and tau accumulation and functional connectivity between groups. The right middle temporal gyrus (rMTG) was associated with the affective factor, and the right parahippocampal and right fusiform gyri were associated with the apathy factor. Moreover, the generalized linear model was able to predict affective factor severity mainly based on the functional connectivity strength between the rMTG and the left supramarginal and angular gyri. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the key regions specific to affective and apathy factors based on the areas with coexistence of amyloid-beta and tau pathologies and the accompanying altered functional connectivity.

T1  - Apathy is distinct from depression or fatigue and is associated with poor physical health in an older community cohort
LA  - eng
SN  - 1741-203X
Y1  - 2025/09/
ET  - 2025/05/29
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate point prevalence of apathy in older adults, examine its overlap with depression and fatigue, and explore its associations with multimorbidity and objective markers of health. DESIGN: Sydney Memory and Ageing Study, an Australian population-based cohort. SETTING: Community dwellings between 2005-2007. PARTICIPANTS: 1,030 older adults, without dementia, aged 70-90. MEASUREMENTS: Apathy was classified using strict (=3) and standard (≥2) cutoff scores on the self-report Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)-3A, and a validated cutoff score (>0) on the informant-report Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Depression was assessed with strict and standard cutoffs on the GDS-12D, and fatigue with the Assessment of Quality of Life-6D. Multimorbidity (≥2 chronic conditions; computed with and without cardiovascular conditions), physical performance (walking speed, sit-to-stand, lateral stability, grip strength), adiposity (BMI, waist circumference), blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose were assessed. RESULTS: Prevalence of apathy on the self-reported measure was 15.8 % (strict cutoff) or 48.9 % (standard). Informant-reported apathy was lower (2.9 %). Prevalence of self-reported depression was 5.9 % (strict cutoff) or 15.8 % (standard), and fatigue 9.8 %. Apathy overlapped very little with depression or fatigue (κ = .18, 95 % CI .14-.21). Apathy was associated with multimorbidity (even when excluding cardiovascular conditions), adiposity, fasting blood glucose level and physical performance, but not blood pressure or cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: Apathy is more common than depression or fatigue in dementia-free older adults. It does not typically co-occur with these symptoms, but is accompanied by poorer physical health, including multimorbidity and metabolic dysregulation. Apathy may be relevant for public health and an important consideration in clinical care.

T1  - Mapping of validated apathy scales onto the apathy diagnostic criteria for neurocognitive disorders
LA  - eng
SN  - 1741-203X
Y1  - 2025/09/
ET  - 2025/04/25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnostic criteria for apathy in neurocognitive disorders (DCA-NCD) have recently been updated. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether validated scales measuring apathy severity capture the three dimensions of the DCA-NCD (diminished initiative, diminished interest, diminished emotional expression). MEASUREMENTS: Degree of mapping ("not at all", "weakly", or "strongly") between items on two commonly used apathy scales, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician (NPI-C) apathy and Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), with the DCA-NCD overall and its 3 dimensions was evaluated by survey. DESIGN: Survey participants, either experts (n = 12, DCA-NCD authors) or scientific community members (n = 19), rated mapping for each item and mean scores were calculated. Interrater reliability between expert and scientific community members was assessed using Cohen's kappa. RESULTS: According to experts, 9 of 11 (81.8%) NPI-C apathy items and 6 of 18 (33.3%) AES items mapped strongly onto the DCA-NCD overall. For the scientific community group, 10 of 11 (90.9%) NPI-C apathy items and 7 of 18 (38.8%) AES items mapped strongly onto the DCA-NCD overall. The overall mean mapping scores were higher for the NPI-C apathy compared to the AES for both expert (t (11) = 3.13, p = .01) and scientific community (t (17) = 3.77, p = .002) groups. There was moderate agreement between the two groups on overall mapping for the NPI-C apathy (kappa= 0.74 (0.57, 1.00)) and AES (kappa= 0.63 (0.35, 1.00)). CONCLUSIONS: More NPI-C apathy than AES items mapped strongly and uniquely onto the DCA-NCD and its dimensions. The NPI-C apathy may better capture the DCA-NCD and its dimensions compared with the AES.

T1  - Qualitative study of fatigue in adults with primary mitochondrial disease: Development of the PROMIS Fatigue Mitochondrial Disease Short Form
LA  - eng
SN  - 1096-7206
Y1  - 2025/08/
ET  - 2025/05/26
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a debilitating symptom in patients with primary mitochondrial disease nPMD). Developing new treatments that improve fatigue is a patient priority but is hampered by a lack of fit-for-purpose patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). We aimed to understand the impact of fatigue on the lives of people with PMD and develop a brief PMD-specific PROM to evaluate fatigue in clinical trials. METHODS: Adults with genetically confirmed PMD and self-reported moderate-to-severe fatigue and myopathy/exercise intolerance participated in a concept elicitation interview to explore their experiences of fatigue. Interview transcripts were coded thematically using MAXQDA™. Characteristics and impacts that emerged from the interviews were mapped to items in the PROMIS® Fatigue item bank. Participants then engaged in a cognitive interview to assess relevance and understandability of PROMIS Fatigue items considered for the PROM. RESULTS: Twelve adults with PMD (n = 8 women, age 20-75 years) were interviewed. The most frequently reported characteristics of fatigue included tiredness, muscle weakness/fatigue, exhaustion, lack of energy, and mental fatigue. Fatigue affected patients' ability to perform daily life activities, including household chores, leisure activities, physical activity/exercise, and work/school, and negatively affected mood and relationships. Nine items were included in the final PROM based on level of endorsement of underlying concepts elicited by the concept elicitation interviews and relevance, clarity, and ease of answering, as assessed in the cognitive interviews. CONCLUSION: The nine-item PROMIS Fatigue Mitochondrial Disease Short Form is the first PROM designed specifically to assess fatigue in PMD. This study demonstrates the content validity of the short form, and future longitudinal studies will assess its psychometric properties.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To validate the Depression, Anxiety, and Apathy (DA3) scale for assessing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and apathy in community-dwelling mid- and late-life adults with and without cognitive impairment. DESIGN: Cross-sectional psychometric validation study. SETTING: Community-based longitudinal study of brain health. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 252 participants (mean age, 68.8 ± 9.4 years; 68.5% women; 71.3% non-Hispanic White; 66.8% cognitively normal) completed the study. MEASUREMENTS: The DA3 scale was compared with established measures of mood including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Apathy Scale (AS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD7), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ8), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). Psychometric properties were assessed using reliability and validity measures, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and Mokken scale analysis. RESULTS: The DA3 demonstrated strong internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha, 0.670-0.781). CFA supported a three-factor model corresponding to distinct depression, anxiety, and apathy dimensions, with excellent goodness-of-fit. Mokken analysis confirmed acceptable-to-strong scalability (H coefficients, 0.36-0.54). The DA3 subscales demonstrated strong convergent validity with established measures (e.g., HADS, AS, GAD-7, and PHQ-8). Cut-off scores of five on each subscale achieved optimal agreement with gold standard measures. Performance of the DA3 was consistent across sociodemographic, neuropsychological, and cognitive subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The DA3 is a unitary, brief, valid, and reliable tool for assessing depression, anxiety, and apathy in community-dwelling older adults, including those with cognitive impairment. Its strong psychometric properties support its use in both clinical and research settings. Future studies should examine its longitudinal utility to better understand its role in tracking mood symptoms over time.

T1  - Behavioural changes in frontotemporal dementia and their cognitive and neuroanatomical correlates
LA  - eng
SN  - 1460-2156
SN  - 0006-8950
Y1  - 2025/08/01
AB  - Behavioural changes are a central feature of frontotemporal dementia (FTD); they occur in both behavioural-variant (bvFTD) and semantic dementia (SD)/semantic-variant primary progressive aphasia subtypes. In this study, we addressed two current clinical knowledge gaps: (i) are there qualitative or clear distinctions between behavioural profiles in bvFTD and SD; and (ii) what are the precise roles of the prefrontal cortex and anterior temporal lobes in supporting social behaviour? Resolving these conundrums is crucial for improving diagnostic accuracy and for the development of targeted interventions to treat challenging behaviours in FTD. Informant questionnaires to assess behavioural changes included the Cambridge Behavioural Inventory-Revised and two targeted measures of apathy and impulsivity. Participants completed a detailed neuropsychological battery to permit investigation of the relationship between cognitive status (including social-semantic knowledge, general semantic knowledge and executive function) with behaviour change in FTD. To explore changes in regional grey matter volume, a subset of patients had structural MRI. Diagnosis-based group comparisons were supplemented by a transdiagnostic approach that encompassed the spectrum of bvFTD, SD and 'mixed' or intermediate cases. Such an approach is sensitive to the systematic graded variation in FTD and allows the neurobiological underpinnings of behaviour change to be explored across an FTD spectrum. We found a wide range of behavioural changes across FTD. Although quantitatively more severe on average in bvFTD, as expected, the item-level analyses found no evidence for qualitative differences in behavioural profiles or 'behavioural double dissociations' between bvFTD and SD. Comparisons of self and informant ratings revealed strong discrepancies in the perspective of the caregiver versus the patient. Logistic regression revealed that neuropsychological measures had better discriminative accuracy for bvFTD versus SD than caregiver-reported behavioural measures. A principal component analysis of all informant questionnaire domains extracted three components, interpreted as reflecting: (i) apathy; (ii) challenging behaviours; and (iii) activities of daily living. More severe apathy in both FTD subtypes was associated with: (i) increased levels of impaired executive function; and (ii) anterior cingulate cortex atrophy. Questionnaire ratings of impaired behaviour were not correlated with either anterior temporal lobe atrophy or degraded social-semantic knowledge. Together, these findings highlight the presence of a wide range of behavioural changes in both bvFTD and SD, which vary by degree rather than quality. We recommend a transdiagnostic approach for future studies of the neuropsychological and neuroanatomical underpinnings of behavioural deficits in FTD.

T1  - Noradrenaline for progressive supranuclear palsy syndromes (NORAPS): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover Phase IIb clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral atomoxetine for treating cognitive and behavioural changes in people with progressive supranuclear palsy syndromes in the UK
LA  - eng
SN  - 2044-6055
Y1  - 2025/07/28
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterised by cognitive, behavioural and motor problems. Motor symptoms are highly disabling, while cognitive and behavioural changes have a major impact on carer burden, quality of life and prognosis. Apathy and impulsivity are very common, often coexistent in PSP, and negatively predict survival. In preclinical models and other diseases, apathy and impulsivity are associated with noradrenergic deficits, which can be severe in PSP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Noradrenaline for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Syndromes trial is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, Phase IIb clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral atomoxetine for the treatment of cognitive and behavioural changes in PSP. Participants receive atomoxetine 40 mg (10 mg/mL oral solution) once daily or a matched placebo solution, in random order, each for 8 weeks. An 'informant', who knows the patient with PSP well, is co-recruited to complete some of the trial outcome measures. Participants remain in the trial for 22 weeks after randomisation. The primary objectives are to assess (1) safety and tolerability and (2) efficacy versus placebo on challenging behaviours as reported in a subscale of the Cambridge Behavioural Inventory. Secondary and exploratory measures relate to cognition, the PSP Rating Scale, mood and potential baseline predictors of individual response to atomoxetine computed from imaging, genetic and cognitive measures at baseline. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial was approved by the South Central-Oxford B Research Ethics Committee (REC) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (REC reference: 20/SC/0416). Dissemination will include publication in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at academic and public conferences and engagement with patients, the public, policymakers and practitioners.

T1  - Measuring Subjective Vitality and Depletion in Older People from a Self-Determination Theory Perspective: A Dual Country Study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1096-4657
Y1  - 2025/07/22
AB  - As the global older population grows, research increasingly focuses on their well-being and quality of life, aspects that are often impacted by a perceived loss of energy and fatigue. To describe individuals' energy dynamics, Self-Determination Theory (SDT) has recently proposed a dual-process model based on two constructs: Subjective Vitality and Depletion. The present study aims to validate the Subjective Vitality/Depletion Scale (SVDS), an instrument based on this model. A sample of 726 older adults (over 65) from two countries, USA and Italy (M(age) = 72.57, SD(age) = 6.49), completed the SVDS, the Big Five Inventory 2 - Extra Short Form (BFI-2-XS), the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), and the Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (GSLTPAQ). Confirmatory factor analyses of the SVDS support the SDT hypothesis that Subjective Vitality and Depletion are two distinct, yet related constructs. Full measurement invariance for the scale was achieved across gender and age subgroups, while partial scalar invariance was established across different countries, suggesting some specific influence of cultural factors. Correlations with BFI-2-XS, SF-12, and GSLTPAQ support the SVDS validity. The study provided evidence that the SVDS based on SDT is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing Subjective Vitality and Depletion among older individuals.

AB  - Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) has a significant impact on the quality of life and disease prognosis of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Accurate assessment of psychotic symptoms in PD patients is critical for early detection and intervention. This, in turn, improves clinical outcomes and quality of life. This review evaluates both internationally validated and China-specific assessment tools for PDP, including the Parkinson's Psychosis Questionnaire, Geriatric Apathy Scale, and culturally adapted instruments. We analyze the psychometric properties, cultural applicability, and clinical utility of these tools in Chinese populations. Our findings provide evidence-based recommendations for healthcare professionals to optimize tool selection, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and guide targeted interventions in China's diverse clinical settings. The review also identifies gaps in current assessment approaches and proposes directions for future tool development and validation studies.

T1  - Ambulatory Oxygen for Pulmonary Fibrosis (OxyPuF): a randomised controlled trial and acceptability study
LA  - eng
SN  - 2046-4924
SN  - 1366-5278
Y1  - 2025/07/02
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating condition of unknown cause that results in progressive, irreversible scarring of the lung, manifesting as breathlessness and dry cough. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is thought to be responsible for as many as 1 in 100 deaths in the United Kingdom, killing 5300 people a year. Ambulatory oxygen therapy is commonly used in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis to relieve exertional breathlessness, although evidence to support this strategy is lacking. This pragmatic randomised controlled trial was planned to test whether use of ambulatory oxygen therapy is beneficial in people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: We planned a randomised controlled trial in 260 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who are breathless on exertion and do not meet criteria for long-term oxygen therapy, randomising in a 1 : 1 ratio between ambulatory oxygen therapy and best supportive care. Primary outcome was a quality-of-life questionnaire validated in pulmonary fibrosis, the King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire, measured at 6 months. We calculated our sample size based on the minimum clinically important difference of four units and standard deviation equal to 8.85 in King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire; assuming power of 90% and 5% two-sided significance level, thus required 130 per arm, after accounting for 20% dropout. The trials unit's web-based randomisation algorithm minimises on factors potentially influencing response to ambulatory oxygen therapy, such as severity of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, desaturation to < 88% present on walking, current or recent (within 6 months) pulmonary rehabilitation, and recruitment centre. Secondary outcomes included symptoms, exercise capacity and cost-effectiveness. A process evaluation included assessment of trial fidelity and acceptability of the intervention with use of qualitative research methods and arts approaches with patients and staff. Qualitative interviews were conducted with patients from the Ambulatory Oxygen for Pulmonary Fibrosis trial and the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patient support group Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis, and stakeholders: healthcare professionals and policy-makers. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed clean verbatim. Photovoice methodology was conducted with patients. A workshop prior to data collection informed and guided data collection and analysis. Traditional qualitative analysis and arts-based coproduction analysis approaches were used to produce a short film. An economic model was planned but could not occur due to early termination. RESULTS: The trial was stopped prematurely due to low recruitment. This was due to a combination of the impact of COVID-19 on research infrastructure, financial issues for sites with the payment structure for the trial and lack of equipoise which limited site recruitment. Seven out of 25 eligible, interested patients were randomised after pre-screening, implying a lack of interest among patients in the study. Baseline characteristics indicated that patients were elderly (mean age 81) and predominantly male. Qualitative work with 11 patients and 23 other stakeholders concluded that ambulatory oxygen therapy is desirable, acceptable and widely commissioned in the United Kingdom, such that further trials are not likely to be feasible. CONCLUSION: Although we are not able to formally address our objectives of assessing efficacy and cost-effectiveness of ambulatory oxygen therapy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, it is unlikely that conducting a randomised controlled trial is feasible due to lack of equipoise. FUNDING: This synopsis presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme as award number NIHR131149.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and White Matter Hyperintensities in Older Cognitively Unimpaired Men Versus Women
LA  - eng
SN  - 1099-1166
SN  - 0885-6230
Y1  - 2025/06/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine association patterns of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in men versus women. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data acquired from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. Cognitively unimpaired participants aged ≥ 50 years with data on WMH severity were studied. Using Cardiovascular Health Study scores, WMH were coded as no to mild (score: 0-4), moderate (score: 5-6) or extensive (score: 7-8). NPS were quantified on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. For the purposes of the main analysis, participants were dichotomized for presence of each NPS (0: absent; 1: present). Adjusted binary logistic regression models estimated the odds of having each of 12 NPS by sex-WMH status. To confirm the validity of our findings, the correlations between NPS severity and WMH burden were also separately explored in men and women. RESULTS: Among 4617 participants with normal cognition, there were 1502 men and 2685 women with no to mild WMH changes, 102 men and 274 women with moderate WMH changes and 19 men and 35 women with extensive WMH changes. Greater WMH burden (especially extensive changes) was related to increased odds of lability symptoms (agitation, disinhibition, irritability) and apathy in men but not women. Elation and appetite disorders followed the same trend but failed to achieve statistical significance. The exploratory analysis revealed positive correlations between these symptoms' severity with WMH burden in men but not in women. CONCLUSIONS: WMH burden was differentially associated with NPS in older men versus women with normal cognition.

T1  - A Short Cognitive and Neuropsychiatric Assessment Scale for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy
LA  - eng
SN  - 2330-1619
Y1  - 2025/06/
ET  - 2025/01/27
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) suffer from several neuropsychological impairments. These mainly affect the frontal lobe and subcortical brain structures. However, a scale for the assessment of cognitive and neuropsychiatric disability in PSP is still missing. OBJECTIVES: To create and validate a new scale for cognitive and neuropsychiatric impairment in PSP. METHODS: The Short Cognitive and Neuropsychiatric (ShoCo) scale was developed containing five items (bradyphrenia, apathy, aphasia, dysexecution and disinhibition). Each item can be categorized into 0 = no deficit, 1 = mild deficit, 2 = moderate deficit and 3 = severe deficit. The total score includes 15 points, 0 meaning no deficit and 15 severe deficits. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data from 201 baseline and 71 follow up patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Baseline ShoCo scale results were 5.9 ± 2.9. No significant differences between patients with Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS) and variants (vPSP) could be detected in the PSP-ShoCo scale scores (PSP-RS 6.1 ± 3.0, n = 160, vPSP 5.1 ± 2.6, n = 41, P = 0.057). The scale showed good correlation with established scores (eg, Montreal cognitive assessment r = -0.535, P = 0.001). The ShoCo scale showed significant annualized change within the PSP-RS patients (baseline 6.2 ± 2.9, follow up 6.9 ± 3.1, annualized diff. 1.0 ± 3.1, n = 57, P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: The ShoCo scale seems a promising and valid tool to measure specific neuropsychological disabilities of PSP patients in clinical routine and research.

T1  - Exploring Virtual Reality-Based Reminiscence Therapy on Cognitive and Emotional Well-Being in People with Cognitive Impairments: A Scoping Review
LA  - eng
SN  - 2076-3425

Y1  - 2025/05/13
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly being explored as a non-pharmacological therapy to enhance the well-being of people with cognitive impairment (PwCI). Studies suggest that VR-based interventions improve mood, reduce apathy, and enhance emotional engagement, making VR a valuable tool for cognitive and emotional support. This scoping review synthesizes evidence on VR-based reminiscence therapy (VRRT) for PwCI. It aims to map existing knowledge, highlight implementation challenges, and offer practical, technical design, and evidence-informed recommendations for clinical integration-building on prior reviews that have touched on these aspects, but placing a stronger and more structured emphasis on real-world applicability and translational insights. This review draws extensively on qualitative findings across the included studies to better capture contextual factors, user experiences, facilitator roles, and barriers to usability. Moreover, unlike previous research, we included only studies involving individuals-either directly or via proxies-with an age-related cognitive impairment, formally diagnosed by a qualified authority. METHODS: A systematic search based on the PRISMA-ScR guideline identified 310 studies, of which 11 met the inclusion criteria. These studies assessed the effectiveness and feasibility of immersive VRRT. Research methodologies included longitudinal (n = 2), cross-sectional (n = 2), mixed-methods (n = 4), and randomized controlled trials (n = 3)-with most studies focusing on feasibility-with a cumulative sample size of approximately 287 participants. The quality of the included studies was generally moderate; common limitations included small sample sizes, short intervention periods, and limited control conditions. RESULTS: The findings highlight VRRT's potential to enhance engagement, emotional well-being, and cognitive function. However, usability challenges and technical limitations persist. While VR offers promising benefits, further research is needed to refine interventions, address personalization barriers, and assess long-term effects. CONCLUSIONS: This review underscores the importance of integrating VRRT into care programs and improving accessibility. Future research should enhance methodological rigor to ensure reliable outcomes and maximize VR's impact on PwCI well-being. The scoping review protocol is registered a priori with the Center for Open Science (OSF) (registration type: OSF Preregistration, data registered: 15 November 2024, associated project: osf.io/r7jha, identifier: DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/R7JHA).

T1  - Association of Depression Dimensions With Cognitive Functioning in Community-Dwelling Oldest-Old Adults: The LifeAfter90 Study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1758-5368
SN  - 1079-5014
Y1  - 2025/05/08
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The oldest-old adults (90+) constitute the fastest-growing demographic at the highest dementia risk among older adults. Depression, a common risk factor, inherently presents with heterogeneous clinical manifestations. Here, we explored the associations of the predominant depression dimensions with cognition in the LifeAfter90 study. METHODS: The LifeAfter90 study consists of racially/ethnically diverse community-dwelling adults of >90. Cognitive assessments measured episodic memory, semantic memory, and executive function. Baseline depression was measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 item (GDS-15), yielding dimensions of Dysphoria, Withdrawal-Apathy-Vigor, Anxiety, Hopelessness, and Subjective Memory Complaint (SMC). We used generalized linear mixed models to explore associations between depression dimensions, and cognitive outcomes at baseline and over time adjusting for demographic factors. RESULTS: The cohort (n = 960, mean age 92.4 ± 2.3 years, 61.56% female) was very racially and ethnically diverse with 27% of participants identifying as White, 24% as Asian, 23% as Black, and 19% as Latino. Common complaints included not identifying as "full of energy" (52.45%), preference to "stay home" (46.31%), and "dropped activity" (40.0%), and 25% reported SMC. Depression dimensions showed distinct associations with cognitive outcomes: SMC correlated with worse global cognition, executive function, and verbal episodic memory (all ps < .0001). Hopelessness was associated with worse executive function (p < .001). Over 1.2 years, baseline hopelessness showed a trend for a faster decline in episodic memory (β = -0.22; p = .035). DISCUSSION: In the oldest old, specific dimensions like SMC and hopelessness may help identify individuals at high risk for cognitive decline in this highly vulnerable population.

T1  - Psychometric Evaluation of the Revised Suicide Crisis Inventory (SCI-2) in Germany: Factor Structure, Reliability, and Validity in an Online and Outpatient Sample
LA  - eng
SN  - 1099-0879
SN  - 1063-3995
Y1  - 2025///May-Jun
AB  - BACKGROUND: The suicide crisis syndrome (SCS) is considered a cognitive and affective state preceding a suicide attempt. Previous studies have demonstrated its predictive validity and have shown it to be a uniform disorder entity in various countries worldwide; however, research in Europe remains limited. The aim of this study was therefore to contribute to a cross-cultural perspective on the SCS and to examine its factor structure, reliability, and validity in Germany. METHODS: Data of N = 1157 participants were collected between October 2022 and December 2024 cross-sectionally from a German adult outpatient sample (n = 586; 65% female; age: M[SD] = 36.31[12.80], range: 18-68) and a German adult online sample (n = 571; 74% female; age: M[SD] = 24.69[7.20], range: 18-67). Participants completed the German version of the revised 61-item Suicide Crisis Inventory (SCI-2-G) and other instruments (e.g., SIBS, BDI-II, and DASS) to measure convergent and concurrent criterion validity. Statistical analyses included confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) to confirm the proposed factors (entrapment, affective disturbance, loss of cognitive control, hyperarousal, and social withdrawal). RESULTS: The SCI-2-G total score demonstrated excellent internal consistency, good convergent, and moderate concurrent criterion validity in relation to stress, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and lifetime suicide attempts. The CFA showed good model fit for the online sample and adequate-to-good fit for the outpatient sample, with the five-factor model consistently outperforming the one-factor model. CONCLUSION: CFA yielded adequate-to-good model fit depending on the sample. Analyses indicate that the SCI-2 is a valid measurement tool in Germany. The five-factor solution is suggested to have higher clinical utility than a one-factor solution, as it reflects the current formulation of the proposed SCS diagnosis. Future studies should expand the cross-cultural perspective with longitudinal studies across diverse clinical and nonclinical samples. SUMMARY: First validation of the German revised version Suicide Crisis Inventory (SCI-2-G). Confirmatory factor analyses support the five-factor solution of the scale. Good scale properties for an online and outpatient sample in Germany.

T1  - Motivational disturbances and cognitive effort-based decision-making in Parkinson's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-5126
Y1  - 2025/05/
ET  - 2025/03/18
AB  - BACKGROUND: Motivational disturbances, such as apathy and impulse control disorders (ICDs), frequently co-occur in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The assessment of these motivational disturbances has proven to be challenging due the absence of validated objective behavioral measures for evaluating motivation in older adults. This scenario may contribute to underdiagnosis. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical utility of a modified version of an existing effort-based decision-making task which required cognitive (e.g., working memory) instead of physical (e.g., finger tapping) effort. METHODS: Ninety-five non-demented individuals (45-85 years of age) with idiopathic PD completed a cognitive screening measure, self-report questionnaires, and a cognitive adaptation of the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (COG-EEfRT), which is a multi-trial game where a participant can choose whether to expend greater effort for larger rewards which vary in magnitude and probability. Patients were classified as having clinically significant symptoms of apathy and/or an ICD based on recommended cut-off scores on the Apathy Scale (AS) and Questionnaire for Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson's Disease - Rating Scale (QUIP-RS). The methodological cutoffs defined two groups: Apathy (36.8 %), and ICD (48.4 %). RESULTS: The level of effort expended by patients significantly predicted apathy and ICD status with high accuracy (88.2 % and 82.4 %, respectively), above and beyond age, levodopa equivalent dose and self-report measures of motivation. Additionally, we found that greater symptoms of apathy and ICD (i.e., negative urgency) were significantly correlated with patients choosing to expend greater effort. This result varied based on reward probability and outcome. CONCLUSION: We offer preliminary evidence suggesting the clinical utility of the COG-EEfRT for identifying and quantifying motivational disturbances in PD. Additionally, anticipatory anhedonia and impulsive traits may be important predictors of cognitive effort-based decision-making. Compared to tasks requiring physical effort, the COG-EEfRT may be a more suitable tool for PD and perhaps for people with motor impairment.

T1  - Reliability and Validity of Revised Apathy Evaluation Scale-Self in Community-Dwelling Older Adults
LA  - eng
SN  - 1545-2301
Y1  - 2025///May-Jun
ET  - 2024/07/24
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The questionnaire Apathy Evaluation Scale-Self (AES-S) has been widely adopted globally, demonstrating high reliability and validity. However, direct translation of the AES into Chinese does not fit well into the Chinese cultural setting, so a structured and comprehensive revision is needed to obtain a high reliability and validity version of the scale. METHODS: In this study, 436 adults aged ≥ 60 years from two communities in Beijing were assessed using a modified AES-S. The methodology included item analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis. The scale's validity was tested using the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Reliability assessment included retest reliability, internal consistency reliability, and split-half reliability. RESULTS: The modified Apathy Evaluation Scale-Self-Assessment (AES-S-C) presented a first-order four-factor structure with higher reliability and validity than the original version within the Chinese older adult community. CONCLUSIONS: The revised AES-S-C is more suitable for the Chinese older adults in community settings. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This self-rated scale is suitable for screening apathy among older adults in community or nursing facilities, aiding in the identification of cognitive impairment and promoting mental health.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) is an early marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases, often preceding cognitive decline. The MBI Checklist (MBI-C) is a 34-item tool designed to detect MBI. This study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Greek version of the MBI-C and its ability to differentiate patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-AD) from cognitively unimpaired older adults (healthy participants, HPs). METHODS: A total of 181 participants (104 MCI-AD, 77 HPs) were recruited from the Third Age Day Care Center IASIS (2019-2023), accompanied by a close informant. Participants underwent neuropsychological assessment [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R)], and informants completed the MBI-C. Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's α and known-group validity was assessed via comparing MBI-C between the MCI-AD and HPs groups. Diagnostic accuracy was determined via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The Greek MBI-C showed excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.899). Among its domains, impulse dyscontrol demonstrated the highest reliability (α = 0.901), whereas decreased motivation (α = 0.564) and abnormal perception/thought content (α = 0.617) exhibited lower reliability. MBI-C total and domain scores were significantly higher in patients with MCI-AD than HPs (p < 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.871 (optimal cutoff = 9.5), indicating excellent diagnostic performance. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the Greek MBI-C has strong psychometric properties for MCI-AD. Sociocultural factors might influence symptom identification and reporting, particularly in the domains of decreased motivation and abnormal perception/thought content. Future research should investigate its predictive value for dementia conversion and its applicability to other populations, including individuals with subjective cognitive decline and non-AD causes of MCI.

AB  - BackgroundNeuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are frequent in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, but a higher NPS burden is found in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Lewy body (LB) pathology frequently co-occurs with AD pathology and may not meet neuropathological criteria for DLB (ADLB). NPS trajectories over disease course in these subgroups is not well understood.ObjectiveWe investigated changes in NPS severity over time, at two time points, comparing clinicopathologically defined cohorts of AD (without LB), ADLB, DLB, and controls.MethodsCases with two available Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPIQ), at the time of enrollment and within 2.5 years of death, were selected from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders. Differences and rate of change in NPIQ scores were compared between AD (n = 75), ADLB (n = 48) DLB (n = 65), and controls (n = 32) with covariates for age, sex, and cognition.ResultsFirst NPIQ scores were highest in ADLB when compared to AD (p = 0.04) and controls (p = 0.01) but not different from DLB. A significant increase in NPS severity was observed in DLB and AD (p < 0.001) over a mean follow up time of 4.9 ± 3.0 years, and the rate of change was significantly greater in DLB when compared to other groups. Final NPIQ scores were highest in DLB when compared to AD (p = 0.03) but not ADLB, and in DLB, ADLB, and AD than controls (all p < 0.001).ConclusionsEarly NPS burden as well as NPS severity progression rate, independently of cognitive status, might be useful clinical metrics and may help predict underlying pathological diagnoses.

AB  - This study investigates whether older adults diagnosed with the apathy, gait impairment, and executive dysfunction (AGED) triad, frequently associated with cerebrovascular disease and confounded with depression, have earlier dementia onset. We followed 322 community-dwelling older individuals (mean age 72.0 ± 6.4 years; 58.3% women) free of dementia at baseline for up to 9 years. The AGED triad was identified when gait slowness (< 1 m/s), apathy (assessed by Geriatric Depression Scale-3A with ≥ 2 items), and executive dysfunction (assessed by the 75th percentile of Trail Making Test-part B by age range) were simultaneously present. Incident dementia was diagnosed using the clinical dementia rating scale. Over the 9-year follow-up (mean 45.1 ± 28.6 months), 44 participants (13.6%) converted to dementia. Sixteen participants (5.0%) were diagnosed with AGED triad + and showed a significantly higher risk of earlier conversion to dementia compared with AGED triad- (hazard ratio = 5.08, 95%CI 2.16-11.97; p = 0.0001), as well as to those with only one AGED factor or fewer AGED factors. Hypertension and diabetes were 2 and 3 times more prevalent, respectively, in individuals with AGED triad + . These findings suggest that the AGED triad serves as a simplified and effective behavioral marker for accelerated progression to dementia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of centenarians worldwide is expected to increase dramatically, reaching 3.4 million by 2050 and >25 million by 2100. Despite these projections, depression remains a prevalent yet underdiagnosed and undertreated condition among this population that carries significant health risks. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify and achieve consensus on the most representative signs and symptoms of depression in near-centenarians and centenarians (aged ≥95 years) through an e-Delphi study with an international and interdisciplinary panel of experts. Ultimately, the outcomes of this study might help create a screening instrument that is specifically designed for this unique population. METHODS: A modified e-Delphi study was carried out to achieve expert consensus on depressive symptoms in near-centenarians and centenarians. A panel of 28 international experts was recruited. Consensus was defined as 70% agreement on the relevance of each item. Data were collected through a web-based questionnaire over 3 rounds. Experts rated 104 items that were divided into 24 dimensions and 80 criteria to identify the most representative signs and symptoms of depression in this age group. RESULTS: The panel consisted of experts from various countries, including physicians with experience in old age psychiatry or geriatrics as well as nurses and psychologists. The response rate remained consistent over the rounds (20/28, 71% to 21/28, 75%). In total, 4 new dimensions and 8 new criteria were proposed by the experts, and consensus was reached on 86% (24/28) of the dimensions and 80% (70/88) of the criteria. The most consensual potentially relevant dimensions were lack of hope (21/21, 100%), loss of interest (27/28, 96%), lack of reactivity to pleasant events (27/28, 96%), depressed mood (26/28, 93%), and previous episodes of depression or diagnosed depression (19/21, 90%). In addition, the most consensual potentially relevant criteria were despondency, gloom, and despair (25/25, 100%); depressed (27/27, 100%); lack of reactivity to pleasant events or circumstances (28/28, 100%); suicidal ideation (28/28, 100%); suicide attempt(s) (28/28, 100%); ruminations (27/28, 96%); recurrent thoughts of death or suicide (27/28, 96%); feelings of worthlessness (25/26, 96%); critical life events (20/21, 95%); anhedonia (20/21, 95%); loss of interest in activities (26/28, 93%); loss of pleasure in activities (26/28, 93%); and sadness (24/26, 92%). Moreover, when assessing depression in very old age, the duration, number, frequency, and severity of signs and symptoms should also be considered, as evidenced by the high expert agreement. CONCLUSIONS: The classification of most elements as relevant highlights the importance of a multidimensional approach for optimal depression screening among individuals of very old age. This study offers a first step toward improving depression assessment in near-centenarians and centenarians. The development of a more adapted screening tool could improve early detection and intervention, enhancing the quality of mental health care for this population.

T1  - Reliability, validity, and diagnostic accuracy of the apathy evaluation scale in chronic stroke survivors
LA  - eng
SN  - 1471-244X
Y1  - 2025/03/05
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the psychometric properties of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) in chronic stroke survivors. METHODS: In this study, 112 non-cognitive impairment stroke survivors participated. Acceptability, inter-rater, and test-retest reliability of the three Persian versions of AES (clinician, informant, and self-rated) were evaluated. The correlation of three AES versions with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and Barthel Index (BI) was evaluated. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of the three AES versions, stroke survivors were classified as apathetic (n = 43) and non-apathetic (n = 69) groups using the 'diagnostic criteria of apathy'. RESULTS: The floor and ceiling effect, skewness, and kurtosis were within acceptable range for three AES versions. Internal consistency (α = 0.88-0.91) and test-retest and inter-rater reliability (ICC(2,1) >0.90) were acceptable for all AES versions. Standard Error of Measurement and Minimal Detectable Change values for test-retest and/or inter-rater reliability ranged 1.6-2.5 and 4.42-6.93 for three versions of AES, respectively. Significant moderate to high correlation (r or ƿ = -0.34-0.69) was found between three AES versions and HADS-D, HADS-A, BI, and mRS. The cut-off point > 34 (sensitivity = 87.5%, specificity = 72.22%, and AUC = 0.80) was derived for discriminating apathetic from non-apathetic stroke survivors based on the AES- self-rated total score. CONCLUSION: All three AES versions are reliable and valid screening tools to evaluate and characterize apathy in stroke survivors. The AES-self-rated had good discriminative validity for discriminating apathetic from non-apathetic subjects in non-cognitive impairment stroke survivors.

T1  - Is the social withdrawal subscale a valid instrument to assess social withdrawal among colorectal cancer survivors with permanent stomas? A validation study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1471-244X
Y1  - 2025/03/05
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although social withdrawal is common among colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors with permanent stomas, it has been poorly addressed due to a lack of valid assessment tools. The social withdrawal subscale (SWS) from the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale shows promise for assessing social withdrawal. However, there was no available data on its validity for this purpose. This study aimed to investigate the reliability and validity of the SWS as a screening tool for identifying survivors at risk of social withdrawal. METHODS: Two separate convenience samples of 127 and 245 CRC survivors with permanent stomas were selected. Item analysis and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) were conducted with the first sample of 127 survivors. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), reliability analysis, and tests for convergent and discriminant validity were performed with the second sample of 245 survivors. Additionally, the screening cut-off score and accuracy of the SWS scores were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The item-total correlation coefficients of the SWS ranged from 0.530 to 0.787. The EFA demonstrated a single-factor structure for the SWS. The CFA confirmed appropriate construct validity (χ²/df = 103.115/52 = 1.983, goodness-of-fit index (GFI) = 0.925, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.959, and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.068). The test-retest reliability was 0.849. Pearson correlation analysis showed significant and moderate to large relationships between the SWS and the chosen criterion measures, supporting its good convergent validity. ROC analysis identified SWS scores of ≥ 15 as the optimal screening cut-off, with a sensitivity of 86.5%, specificity of 50.5%, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.748 (95% CI: 0.673-0.823, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The SWS demonstrates acceptable reliability and validity for measuring social withdrawal among CRC survivors with permanent stomas. Future studies should further evaluate its utility in clinical settings.

T1  - Development and Feasibility Study of HOPE Model for Prediction of Depression Among Older Adults Using Wi-Fi-based Motion Sensor Data: Machine Learning Study
LA  - eng
SN  - 2561-7605
Y1  - 2025/03/03
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression, characterized by persistent sadness and loss of interest in daily activities, greatly reduces quality of life. Early detection is vital for effective treatment and intervention. While many studies use wearable devices to classify depression based on physical activity, these often rely on intrusive methods. Additionally, most depression classification studies involve large participant groups and use single-stage classifiers without explainability. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility of classifying depression using nonintrusive Wi-Fi-based motion sensor data using a novel machine learning model on a limited number of participants. We also conduct an explainability analysis to interpret the model's predictions and identify key features associated with depression classification. METHODS: In this study, we recruited adults aged 65 years and older through web-based and in-person methods, supported by a McGill University health care facility directory. Participants provided consent, and we collected 6 months of activity and sleep data via nonintrusive Wi-Fi-based sensors, along with Edmonton Frailty Scale and Geriatric Depression Scale data. For depression classification, we proposed a HOPE (Home-Based Older Adults' Depression Prediction) machine learning model with feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and classification stages, evaluating various model combinations using accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and F(1)-score. Shapely addictive explanations and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations were used to explain the model's predictions. RESULTS: A total of 6 participants were enrolled in this study; however, 2 participants withdrew later due to internet connectivity issues. Among the 4 remaining participants, 3 participants were classified as not having depression, while 1 participant was identified as having depression. The most accurate classification model, which combined sequential forward selection for feature selection, principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction, and a decision tree for classification, achieved an accuracy of 87.5%, sensitivity of 90%, and precision of 88.3%, effectively distinguishing individuals with and those without depression. The explainability analysis revealed that the most influential features in depression classification, in order of importance, were "average sleep duration," "total number of sleep interruptions," "percentage of nights with sleep interruptions," "average duration of sleep interruptions," and "Edmonton Frailty Scale." CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this preliminary study demonstrate the feasibility of using Wi-Fi-based motion sensors for depression classification and highlight the effectiveness of our proposed HOPE machine learning model, even with a small sample size. These results suggest the potential for further research with a larger cohort for more comprehensive validation. Additionally, the nonintrusive data collection method and model architecture proposed in this study offer promising applications in remote health monitoring, particularly for older adults who may face challenges in using wearable devices. Furthermore, the importance of sleep patterns identified in our explainability analysis aligns with findings from previous research, emphasizing the need for more in-depth studies on the role of sleep in mental health, as suggested in the explainable machine learning study.

AB  - BackgroundTheory of mind (ToM) is crucial for socioemotional interaction. ToM deficits may explain behavioral changes in dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).ObjectiveThis study examined the psychometrics of a new ToM test in healthy adults, identified ToM differences in dementia syndromes, and assessed if ToM scores predict neuropsychiatric function and real-life behavior.MethodsThe UCSF Cognitive and Emotional Perspective Taking Test (CEPT) was evaluated in 195 healthy adults (age: 42.69 ± 16.20) and in a clinic cohort of 304 participants (age: 64.07 ± 9.2). Participants included healthy controls, AD, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), non-fluent PPA (nfvPPA), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients. CEPT's psychometrics were assessed, and ToM differences and predictions of neuropsychiatric symptoms were analyzed using regression models.ResultsIn controls, CEPT showed good validity and reliability. In patients, CEPT scores correlated with executive and emotional measures, but not language measures, showing good construct validity. Cognitive ToM was most impaired in AD and bvFTD, with less impairment in svPPA and PSP, and all patient groups showed impaired emotional ToM. ToM performance predicted real-life neuropsychiatric behavior, including anxiety, apathy, disinhibition, and aberrant motor behaviors.ConclusionsToM deficits appear early in dementia syndromes and predict neuropsychiatric behavior. Assessing ToM and social cognition with ecologically valid tasks may help identify altered social cognition in early neurodegeneration.

T1  - Psychometric properties of the Spanish Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory in people with heart diseases
LA  - eng
SN  - 1527-3288
Y1  - 2025///Mar-Apr
ET  - 2025/01/02
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is one of the most limiting symptoms in individuals with heart disease (HD). However, valid and reliable instruments for assessing fatigue in clinical practice still need to be improved. OBJECTIVE: To assess the dimensional structure of the self-reported Spanish Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) and analyze its psychometric properties in individuals with HD. METHODS: A longitudinal observational study included 247 participants (age 57.71 years; 23.9 % women; 89.9 % Caucasian). Test-retest reliability was assessed 10-14 days after the first evaluation. Measures evaluating fatigue, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and functional capacity were collected to assess convergent validity. Acceptability, practicality, construct validity, floor/ceiling effects, internal consistency, and measurement error were also calculated. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis supported the 4-factor structure of the MFI and the deletion of 3 items for its application in individuals with HD. The 17-item version showed no floor-ceiling effects and exhibited excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.90) and test-retest reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) = 0.94). While all subscales demonstrated adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's α > 0.70) and good to excellent test-retest reliability (ICC, 0.75 - 0.91), the reduced motivation subscale showed slightly lower internal consistency. The minimal detectable change was 9.5 points for the total score. Convergent validity was established through moderate-strong correlations with fatigue, HRQoL, and functional capacity measures (r = |0.320-0.729|). CONCLUSIONS: The shortened version of the Spanish MFI (MFI-17) is a valid and reliable tool for quantifying fatigue in individuals with HD, supporting its clinical and research applicability.

T1  - Demoralization's link to depression and anxiety symptoms: A network analysis
LA  - eng
SN  - 1573-2517
Y1  - 2025/03/01
ET  - 2024/12/13
AB  - Demoralization represents a clinical syndrome conceptualized as maladaptive coping to a stressor associated with discouragement, feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and a loss of meaning in life. It is a prevalent comorbidity in individuals with severe physical illnesses and affects a substantial proportion of the general population when facing global stressors like the COVID-19 pandemic. The main aim of the study was to test whether demoralization and features of depression and anxiety might reflect distinct entities within the general population, specifically in older adults, and to explore symptom interconnections, using a network psychometrics approach. The revised demoralization scale (DS-II) and the patient health questionnaire 4 (PHQ-4) were applied to a representative sample (N = 2434) from the German general population. Network structures were analyzed using exploratory graph analysis (EGA) to identify the most distinct symptom groupings and their relationships. Stability of networks and symptom groupings was tested using bootstrap procedures. EGA revealed unidimensionality within younger adulthood and a four-factor solution within older adults, reliably distinguishing PHQ-4 and DS-II items. The most central features of the network were worthlessness, pointlessness, helplessness, feeling trapped and low mood. Suicidal ideation was more closely related to DS-II worthlessness than to PHQ-4 items. The cross-sectional design and using PHQ-4 instead of more comprehensive measures of depression and anxiety were limitations. In conclusion, in general population, demoralization symptoms can be distinguished from lack of interest or pleasure and low mood. It might represent a valid psychological construct beyond clinical populations. Further investigation of diagnostic implications is encouraged.

T1  - Psychometric properties and clinical correlates of the Frontal Behaviour Inventory in progressive supranuclear palsy: data from the PSP-NET
LA  - eng

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as apathy, disinhibition and irritability, are common in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). The Frontal Behaviour Inventory (FBI) is a useful instrument for the evaluation of behavioural disorders in neurodegenerative diseases. The main goal of the present study was to explore the psychometric properties of the FBI in PSP. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: FBI was administered to the PSP-NET cohort including Italian patients diagnosed according to the Movement Disorder Society criteria. Patients underwent a clinical interview, a motor evaluation, extensive cognitive and behavioural testing. RESULTS: Two hundred and eight subjects were included in this study. The internal consistency was high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.868) and no improvement of this value was noted upon removal of any item. FBI showed also good acceptability, reliability and validity. The standard error of measurement (SEM) value for FBI total score was 0.169 [SEM = SD √ (1 - Cronbach's alpha)]. Factor analysis indicated a five-factor structure: Apathy, Behavioural disorders, Impulsivity, Motor and speech frontal behaviour and Executive disorders that explained the 54.92% of the total variance. Linear regression analysis showed that global cognitive impairment significantly affects both Apathy and Motor and speech frontal behaviour factors. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, FBI is a reliable and valid tool for the assessment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PSP, despite some constructs, such as euphoria and irritability, are better measured by the NPI. Two third of the cohort was represented by Richardson's syndrome, thus our data are mainly applicable to such common phenotype. Such data are useful in both clinical and research settings to plan adequate therapeutic interventions and to improve the quality of life of PSP patients and their caregivers.

T1  - Inpatient preferences among patients with multiple chronic conditions in China: A discrete choice experiment
LA  - eng
SN  - 2731-4553
Y1  - 2025/02/07
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple chronic conditions (MCC) have become a leading cause of low vitality and high mortality among the Chinese population. Although a series of policies has been implemented to promote patients' rational access to health care, patients still prefer a higher level of inpatient service, hampering the efficient utilization of resources in county hospitals, which are the first point of contact for inpatient care. Thus, this study aimed to identify the factors that affect MCC patients' inpatient preferences and the extent to which these factors influence their decisions, thereby guiding inpatient service utilization among MCC patients. METHODS: Five attributes (institution scale, waiting time for hospital admission, presence of acquaintances, travel time from residence to hospital, and out-of-pocket expenses per visit) were identified to estimate inpatient choice for MCC patients through a discrete choice experiment. A partial factor analysis was performed to generate selection sets. Data were collected from MCC patients aged between 35 and 75 years, in Fuqing City, China. A mixed logit model was used to analyse MCC patients' preferences for each attribute. Willingness to pay was estimated by regression coefficients, and interaction terms were included in the model to estimate the heterogeneity of inpatient preferences among MCC patients. RESULTS: A total of 504 valid questionnaires were included in the analysis. The most important attribute of patients when choosing inpatient care is out-of-pocket expenses per visit, followed by travel time from residence to hospital, waiting time for hospital admission, institution scale, and presence of acquaintances. In addition, patients were willing to pay ¥1253, ¥434, and ¥323 for shorter times from the residence to the hospital, larger institutional scale, and beds available on the day, respectively. The findings of the interaction analysis indicated that age and gender also influence MCC patients' inpatient preferences. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of the inpatient preferences of MCC patients. Increasing inpatient insurance reimbursement rates, bolstering the leading role of district and county hospitals in the area, and strengthening information systems will empower district and county hospitals to effectively serve as the first point of contact for inpatient care.

T1  - LAsting Symptoms after Oesophageal Resectional Surgery (LASORS): multicentre validation cohort study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1365-2168
SN  - 0007-1323
Y1  - 2025/02/01
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term symptom burden and health-related quality-of-life outcomes after curative oesophageal cancer treatment are poorly understood. Existing tools are cumbersome and do not address the post-treatment population specifically. The aim of this study was to validate the six-symptom LASORS tool for identifying patients after curative oesophageal cancer treatment with poor health-related quality of life and to assess its clinical utility. METHODS: Between 2015 and 2019, patients from 15 UK centres who underwent curative-intent oesophageal cancer treatment, and were disease-free at least 1 year after surgery, were invited to participate in the study and complete LASORS and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OG25 questionnaires. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to examine the accuracy of the LASORS tool for identifying patients with poor health-related quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 263 patients completed the questionnaire. Four of the six LASORS symptoms were associated with poor health-related quality of life: reduced energy (OR 2.13 (95% c.i. 1.45 to 3.13)); low mood (OR 1.86 (95% c.i. 1.20 to 2.88)); diarrhoea more than three times a day unrelated to eating (OR 1.48 (95% c.i. 1.06 to 2.07)); and bloating or cramping after eating (OR 1.35 (95% c.i. 1.03 to 1.77)). The LASORS tool showed good diagnostic accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.858 for identifying patients with poor health-related quality of life. CONCLUSION: The six-symptom LASORS tool generated a reliable model for identification of patients with poor health-related quality of life after curative treatment for oesophageal cancer. This is the first tool of its kind to be prospectively validated in the post-esophagectomy population. Clinical utility lies in identification of patients at risk of poor health-related quality of life, ease of use of the tool, and in planning survivorship services.

T1  - Convergent, discriminant, and known-groups validity of the Behavioural Assessment Screening Tool (BAST) in chronic traumatic brain injury
LA  - eng
SN  - 1839-5252
SN  - 1443-9646
Y1  - 2025/02/
AB  - Background The Behavioural Assessment Screening Tool (BAST), which measures self-reported neurobehavioural symptoms experienced by adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI), was specifically developed as a self-reported measure for remote symptom reporting. Our aim was to assess the convergent, discriminant, and known-groups validity of the BAST among community-dwelling adults with TBI. Methods We assessed correlations and group differences with previously validated measures in two existing datasets (n =111, n =134). Other measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (depression), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (anxiety), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (Executive Dysfunction, Apathy, Disinhibition), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (Fatigue), Aggression Questionnaire (anger, hostility, physical and verbal aggression), and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (alcohol misuse). Results BAST subscales had stronger correlations with measures of similar (|r |=0.602-0.828, P r |=0.364-0.589, P r |d =1.2-1.9) for known groups with moderate-severe depression, moderate-severe anxiety, fatigue, problematic disinhibited and frontal executive behaviours, and alcohol misuse. Results support the construct validity of the BAST subscales. Conclusion(s) The BAST demonstrated good convergent, discriminant, and known-groups validity, supporting its use for remote self-reported symptom reporting to improve chronic symptom monitoring in community-dwelling adults with TBI.

T1  - Safety and Efficacy of Deutetrabenazine at High versus Lower Daily Dosages in the ARC-HD Study to Treat Chorea in Huntington Disease

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes psychiatric and neurological symptoms, including involuntary and irregular muscle movements (chorea). Chorea can disrupt activities of daily living, pose safety issues, and may lead to social withdrawal. The vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitors tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine are approved treatments that can reduce chorea. OBJECTIVE: This post hoc analysis was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy among participants who received high-dosage deutetrabenazine treatment (> 48 mg/d) in ARC-HD, an open-label study that assessed long-term safety and efficacy of deutetrabenazine for the treatment of chorea in HD in adults. METHODS: ARC-HD was a single-arm, two-cohort, open-label study. Participants either successfully completed the First-HD study or switched overnight from tetrabenazine to deutetrabenazine. Participants were dosed with deutetrabenazine in a response-driven manner (maximum 72 mg/d allowed). For the current analysis, exposure-adjusted incidence rates (EAIRs) for adverse events of interest were analyzed according to daily dosage (≤ 48 mg/d versus > 48 mg/d), and total maximal chorea (TMC) scores were analyzed by cohort during the stable-dose period. RESULTS: In total, 116 of the 119 participants enrolled in ARC-HD entered the stable-dose period, where no apparent differences were seen in EAIRs when receiving deutetrabenazine dosages ≤ 48 mg/d (exposure = 177.7 person-years) compared with > 48 mg/d (exposure = 74.1 person-years). Similar results were found among the subset of participants who received deutetrabenazine dosages > 48 mg/d at least once during the study (n = 49, 42%) when their dosage was ≤ 48 mg/d (exposure = 37.9 person-years) versus > 48 mg/d (74.1 person-years). Efficacy analyses were conducted for participants who had TMC scores available (rollover cohort, n = 77; switch cohort, n = 35). For most participants, the lowest deutetrabenazine dosage needed to achieve a TMC response (≥ 30% improvement from baseline) was between 24 and 48 mg/d in both the rollover (n = 57, 74.0%) and switch (n = 16, 46.0%) cohorts. Whereas the dosage needed for a TMC response was independent of baseline TMC score in the rollover cohort, participants with higher baseline TMC scores in the switch cohort required higher dosages to achieve a TMC response during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: In this open-label, long-term study, some participants received deutetrabenazine dosing > 48 mg/d to achieve adequate chorea control. There was no new safety concern or incremental change in the safety profile between dosages of ≤ 48 mg/d and > 48 mg/d. These results include dosages that have not been approved for clinical use, however, they increase our understanding of safety and tolerability of deutetrabenazine doses.

T1  - Social Disengagement in Post-Pandemic China: A Translation, Validation and Cross-Cultural Comparison of the Pandemic Disengagement Syndrome Scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 1365-2753
Y1  - 2025/02/
AB  - BACKGROUND: In contrast to abundant research on the various acute mental effects of COVID-19, the long-term influences of the pandemic are still underexplored in China owing to the paucity of assessment tools. The Pandemic Disengagement Syndrome Scale (PDSS) assesses people's social disengagement as a lasting psychological consequence in Western countries during the post-COVID-19 pandemic era. However, its generalizability across cultures is untested. OBJECTIVES: The present studies aimed to validate Chinese PDSS and compare disengagement syndrome levels among China, the United States and Italy. METHOD: In Study 1, a Chinese version of the PDSS was developed, psychometric properties including factor structure, internal consistency, measurement invariance across gender and country, discriminant validity, and test-retest reliability were tested. Study 2 examined demographic differences in the pandemic disengagement syndrome in China and compared Chinese PDSS scores and those in the United States and Italy (Ns = 415(US), 455(Italy), 826(China)). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The findings indicated that disengagement syndrome may exist among Chinese people even substantially after the acute phases of the pandemic. Meanwhile, the Chinese PDSS demonstrating acceptable psychometric features can be a valid instrument to assess the syndrome. Several possible reasons for the persistence of disengagement in China are discussed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Quality of Life-Bronchiectasis (QOL-B) questionnaire and Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Short Form v1.0-Fatigue 7a (PROMIS-F SF-7a) have the potential to measure respiratory and fatigue symptoms, respectively, in patients with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease but have not yet been evaluated for content validity in this population. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted in United States patients with a current MAC lung disease diagnosis. Concept elicitation (CE) interviews were conducted (n = 25 participants) to identify key respiratory and fatigue symptoms expressed as important and relevant to patients with MAC lung disease and to evaluate the appropriateness of the QOL-B and PROMIS-F SF-7a to measure these symptoms. Cognitive interviews (CIs) were subsequently conducted (n = 20 participants) to evaluate the relevance, comprehensibility, and appropriateness of the QOL-B respiratory domain (QOL-B-RD) and PROMIS-F SF-7a. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded for qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The most important or relevant respiratory symptom concepts to CE interview participants were "cough," "shortness of breath during activity," and "mucus/phlegm." The most important or relevant fatigue symptom concepts were "tiredness," "lack of energy," and "tire easily/low stamina." These symptoms are covered by existing items in the QOL-B-RD and PROMIS-F SF-7a. Cognitive interview participants' feedback confirmed the item content, response options, concept attributes, and recall period for each instrument were effective, relevant, and meaningful to most patients with MAC lung disease. Based on Wave 1 findings, the QOL-B instructions were revised for the Wave 2 interviews, where the text referencing "bronchiectasis" was replaced with "your lung condition." Participant feedback in Wave 2 confirmed the revised instruction wording was easily understood and appropriate. CONCLUSIONS: The study results support the content validity of the QOL-B-RD and PROMIS-F SF-7a, which were shown to be relevant and appropriate to evaluate respiratory and fatigue symptoms, respectively, in patients with MAC lung disease.

T1  - Adaptation of the Epilepsy-Related apathy scale to Turkish in adults with Epilepsy: Validity and reliability study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1525-5069
Y1  - 2025/02/
ET  - 2024/11/30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Epilepsy-Related Apathy Scale (E-RAS) in adults with epilepsy. METHODS: In this methodological study, the E-RAS was translated into Turkish using standard procedures and assessed for content validity by a panel of 8 experts. The draft scale was piloted with 10 people to ensure comprehensibility of the questions. For psychometric validation, the Turkish version of the scale was administered to 209 native Turkish speakers over 18 years of age who had epilepsy for at least 1 year and had been using antiepileptic drugs for at least 1 year. RESULTS: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was performed for construct validity. Internal consistency analysis yielded Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficients of 0.813 for the whole scale and 0.802-0.864 for the subscales. In exploratory factor analysis, 9 of the original 24 items were removed (factor loadings < 0.30) and the 4 subscales were condensed to 2, called "Motivational and Emotional" and "Self-Regulatory and Cognitive". CONCLUSION: The 15-item, 2-dimensional Turkish version of the E-RAS was determined to be valid and reliable for use in adults with epilepsy in the Turkish population.

AB  - PURPOSE: To provide further evidence on the psychometric properties of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) in moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD), and to determine thresholds for meaningful improvement in fatigue. METHODS: The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item patient-reported outcome measure (range, 0-52) assessing fatigue over the previous week. Using pooled data from the Phase 3 VIVID-1 study of moderately to severely active CD, psychometric properties of FACIT-Fatigue were evaluated up to Week 52. The Patient Global Rating of Severity (PGRS) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) were used as primary anchors to estimate the FACIT-Fatigue score change representing meaningful improvement. RESULTS: Psychometric analyses included 1065 adults. The FACIT-Fatigue demonstrated good internal consistency, and correlations between individual items and the total score were moderate to strong. The FACIT-Fatigue score showed moderate to strong correlations with other patient-reported assessments and weak correlations with endoscopic/laboratory assessments. The FACIT-Fatigue differentiated between distinct groups of participants varying in disease severity, quality of life, and fatigue based on PGRS and other assessments. FACIT-Fatigue improvements during the study differed significantly between most PGRS change and PGIC categories. Anchor-based estimates suggested a 6-9-point increase in the FACIT-Fatigue total score as meaningful improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The FACIT-Fatigue demonstrated strong psychometric properties in the VIVID-1 population of adults with moderately to severely active CD and determined a FACIT-Fatigue score change threshold representing meaningful improvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Over 80% of Jamaicans are not meeting World Health Organization physical activity guidelines, and over 50% are overweight or obese. Research on barriers to physical activity and their associations with physical activity engagement among Jamaican adults is limited. This study explores the measurement and categorization of barriers to physical activity in Jamaican adults to inform the design and implementation of behavioral physical activity-promoting interventions. PURPOSE: This study applied a psychometric approach to explore the perception of barriers to physical activity and their associations with leisure time physical activity (LTPA) and body mass index (BMI) in Jamaican adults. METHODS: A total of 506 Jamaican adults completed self-report measures of demographic data, height, and weight (to calculate BMI), barriers to physical activity, and LTPA in a cross-sectional survey design. Exploratory structural equation modeling was used to determine the best-fitting model for responses to the barriers to physical activity (BPA) scale. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the associations among BPA, LTPA, and BMI. RESULTS: A 15-item BPA scale with 2 categories of barriers was identified: (1) psychosocial (PS-BPA; 7 items; eg, lack of self-motivation or confidence) and (2) environmental/demographic (ED-BPA; 8 items; safety or financial/cost issues) was identified. PS-BPA but not ED-BPA meaningfully associated with LTPA. LTPA was negatively associated with BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial barriers may at least partially explain why most Jamaican adults do not meet global physical activity guidelines. Psychosocial correlates of physical activity should be emphasized when investigating and targeting physical activity barriers in behavioral interventions among Jamaican adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Late-life depression (LLD) is a heterogenous disorder related to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative processes, raising a need for the development of novel biomarkers. We sought to provide preliminary evidence for acoustic speech signatures sensitive to LLD and their relationship to depressive dimensions. METHODS: Forty patients (24 female, aged 65-82 years) were assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Vocal features were extracted from speech samples (reading a pre-written text) and tested as classifiers of LLD using random forest and XGBoost models. Post hoc analyses examined the relationship between these acoustic features and specific depressive dimensions. RESULTS: The classification models demonstrated moderate discriminative ability for LLD with receiver operating characteristic = 0.78 for random forest and 0.84 for XGBoost in an out-of-sample testing set. The top classifying features were most strongly associated with the apathy dimension (R (2) = 0.43). DISCUSSION: Acoustic vocal features that may support the diagnosis of LLD are preferentially associated with apathy. HIGHLIGHTS: The depressive dimensions in late-life depression (LLD) have different cognitive correlates, with apathy characterized by more pronounced cognitive impairment.Acoustic speech features can predict LLD. Using acoustic features, we were able to train a random forest model to predict LLD in a held-out sample.Acoustic speech features that predict LLD are preferentially associated with apathy. These results indicate a predominance of apathy in the vocal signatures of LLD, and suggest that the clinical heterogeneity of LLD should be considered in development of acoustic markers.

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the reliability, construct, and discriminant validity of the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire 3 (BREQ-3) for evaluating motivational regulations and self-determination for exercise in Brazilian adults aged 50 years or older. The study assessed motivation for exercise, peripheral muscle strength, physical performance, functional capacity, cardiovascular fitness, and frailty phenotype. Two raters independently applied the BREQ-3. The reliability was evaluated using internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and agreement. Construct validity was tested with Spearman's correlation coefficient and discriminant validity with the Kruskal-Wallis test. Eighty individuals participated in the reliability study, and 136 participated in the validation study. Motivational regulation and Self-Determination Index (SDI) internal consistency ranged from 0.55 to 0.82. Test-retest reliability ranged from 0.77 (95% CI 0.64-0.85) to 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.94), and inter-rater ranged from 0.80 (95% CI 0.68-0.87) to 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.95), except for amotivation, which had poor inter-rater and test-retest reliability. Additionally, moderate to weak correlations between various types of motivation and physical function tests were found (p < 0.05). Frail and pre-frail participants had lower SDI, integrated, and intrinsic motivation regulation than non-frail individuals (p < 0.05). This study confirmed the reliability, construct, and discriminative validity of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the BREQ-3 for evaluating motivational regulations and self-determination for exercise in older adults.

T1  - Cognitive impairment predicts medication discrepancies in Huntington's Disease: patient self-report compared to pharmacy records
LA  - eng
SN  - 1432-1459
SN  - 0340-5354
Y1  - 2024/12/12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proper medication reconciliation (= comparing the accuracy of patient-reported medication use with pharmacy records) could prevent potentially dangerous situations such as drug-drug interactions and hospitalization. This is particularly important when patients rely on multiple medications, such as in neurodegenerative disorders like Huntington's Disease (HD). Currently, it is unknown how often medication discrepancies occur in HD patients and which factors contribute to the discrepancies. OBJECTIVE: Identify prognostic factors of medication discrepancies in HD, using patient-reported medication use and local pharmacy records. METHODS: With 134 pre- and manifest HD patients, we performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis with medication discrepancy as dependent variable (pharmacy records as reference value) and sex, CAP score, disease status (pre- or manifest HD), number of concomitant medications taken, presence of an informal caregiver, Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale-Total Functioning Capacity, unified cognitive Z-score and Problem Behaviors Assessment-short characteristic scores for depression, anxiety, and apathy as independent variables. RESULTS: Medication discrepancies were reported frequently, both in premanifest (43.2%) and manifest HD subjects (36.7%). Impaired cognition significantly predicted medication discrepancies (beta = -0.688, SE 0.27, p = 0.011). All other variables were non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of HD disease status and stage, patient self-reported medication use is not a reliable source, especially in those with impaired cognitive function. The presence of an informal caregiver and the absence of polypharmacy, depression, anxiety and apathy do not influence self-reported medication accuracy. Objective verification of medication use with HD patients' local pharmacy is recommended. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ICTRP-NL-OMON55123, HD-med, registered 26-Nov-2019.

Y1  - 2024/11/05
AB  - The aim of the study was to modify the Amotivation Toward Exercise Scale-2 by dropping the outcome amotivation beliefs subscale while retaining the capacity, effort, value, and task characteristics amotivation beliefs. Data from 515 Greek nonexerciser adults aged 19-64 years and 399 Greek nonexerciser older adults aged 65-82 years, men and women, supported the latent four-factor structure of the Revised Amotivation Toward Exercise Scale-2 scores within each sample separately. The hierarchical model was also supported. Measurement invariance of Revised Amotivation Toward Exercise Scale-2 scores was supported across groups of gender, age, body mass index, and educational levels within adults and older adults. Configural measurement invariance supported a replicable factor structure across adults and older adults. Metric and strong invariance was supported across middle-aged and older adults but not between younger and older adults. Full measurement invariance was supported between younger and middle-aged adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Among participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) we estimated the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in apathy symptom severity on three scales. DESIGN: Retrospective anchor- and distribution-based analyses of change in apathy symptom scores. SETTING: Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial (ADMET) and ADMET 2 randomized controlled trials conducted at three and ten clinics specialized in dementia care in United States and Canada, respectively. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and sixty participants (60 ADMET, 200 ADMET 2) with clinically significant apathy in Alzheimer's disease. MEASUREMENTS: The Clinical Global Impression of Change in Apathy scale was used as the anchor measure and the MCID on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Apathy (NPI-A), Dementia Apathy Interview and Rating (DAIR), and Apathy Evaluation Scale-Informant (AES-I) were estimated with linear mixed models across all study visits. The estimated thresholds were evaluated with performance metrics. RESULTS: Among the MCID was a decrease of four points (95% CI: -4.0 to -4.8) on the NPI-A, 0.56 points (95% CI: -0.47 to -0.65) on the DAIR, and three points on the AES-I (95% CI: -0.9 to -5.4). Distribution-based analyses were largely consistent with the anchor-based analyses. The MCID across the three measures showed ∼60% accuracy. Sensitivity analyses found that MMSE scores and apathy severity at baseline influenced the estimated MCID. CONCLUSIONS: MCIDs for apathy on three scales will help evaluate treatment efficacy at the individual level. However, the modest correspondence between MCID and clinical impression of change suggests the need to consider other scales.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to psychometrically evaluate and validate a Japanese version of the Social Functioning in Dementia scale (SF-DEM-J) and investigate changes in social function in people with dementia during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. DESIGN: We interviewed people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia and their caregivers during June 2020-March 2021 to validate patient- and caregiver-rated SF-DEM-J and compared their scores at baseline (April 2020 to May 2020) and at 6-8 months (January 2021 to March 2021) during a time of tighter COVID-19 restrictions. SETTING: The neuropsychology clinic in the Department of Psychiatry at Osaka University Hospital and outpatient clinic in the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at Daini Osaka Police Hospital, Japan. PARTICIPANTS: 103 dyads of patients and caregivers. MEASUREMENTS: SF-DEM-J, Mini-Mental State Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, UCLA Loneliness Scale, and Apathy Evaluation Scale. RESULTS: The scale's interrater reliability was excellent and test-retest reliability was substantial. Content validity was confirmed for the caregiver-rated SF-DEM-J, and convergent validity was moderate. Caregiver-rated SF-DEM-J was associated with apathy, irritability, loneliness, and cognitive impairment. The total score of caregiver-rated SF-DEM-J and the score of Section 2, "communication with others," significantly improved at 6-8 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The SF-DEM-J is acceptable as a measure of social function in MCI and mild dementia. Our results show that the social functioning of people with dementia, especially communicating with others, improved during the COVID-19 pandemic, probably as a result of adaptation to the restrictive life.

T1  - Huntington's disease at work: The effect of profession-specific requirements as related to clinical characteristics on work outcome
LA  - eng
SN  - 1879-6400
Y1  - 2024/11/
ET  - 2024/10/15
AB  - BACKGROUND: In most Huntington's disease expanded gene carriers (HDEGC), losing work capacity is the first sign of functional decline. Cognitive deterioration, motor dysfunction, and psychiatric disturbances are associated with or predict work outcomes in HD. The role of profession-specific requirements, however, has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the relationship between work outcomes, clinical characteristics, burnout, and profession-specific requirements in HDEGC. We hypothesize that burnout-like symptoms are associated with mild apathy and that profession-specific requirements influence clinical characteristics affecting work capacity in HD. METHODS: A cohort of 117 HDEGC (CAG repeat ≥36) participated in the "HD-work" study at Leiden University Medical Center. Participants were 18-67 years old, either, worked at baseline, or had lost their job within two years. The Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale assessed motor abilities, global functioning, and cognition. The HD-work questionnaire and the 'Utrecht Burn Out Scale' assessed work problems and burnout. Statistical methods included descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, Cronbachs alpha, t-tests, and logistic regressions. RESULTS: Burnout-like symptoms did not differ between those with full and reduced working capacity and were not more prevalent in HD than in the general Dutch population. No significant effect was found between work outcomes and profession-specific requirements, even when adjusted for clinical characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that profession-specific requirements do not significantly impact work ability among individuals with HD in early phases of HD. Workplace adjustments should be tailored to individual preferences rather than profession-specific demands. Burnout-like symptoms did not affect work capacity or relate to apathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is an unspecific symptom complex characterized by tiredness, lack of energy, and lack of concentration and is of considerable public health relevance, due to its links with incapacity for work, risk of accidents, and increased need for healthcare. METHODS: The analyses are based on data from 9766 adults of the telephone survey "Gesundheit in Deutschland aktuell (GEDA)" 2023. Fatigue was recorded using the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), a validated instrument with 10 questions for self-assessment of fatigue. The scale was dichotomized into yes (at least mild to moderate fatigue) versus no (no fatigue). Population-weighted prevalences of fatigue and associated sociodemographic and health-related factors were calculated in descriptive analyses and multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of fatigue in adults in Germany is 29.7% (95% CI 28.1-31.2), is highest in 18- to 29-year-olds (39.6% (95% CI 35.0-44.4)), and decreases in the age groups up to 65-79 years (20.6% (95% CI 18.2-23.3)). It is higher again in the very old age group (33.2% (95% CI 28.9-37.7)). Women have a higher risk of fatigue than men (aRR 1.19 (95% CI 1.08-1.32)). Fatigue is significantly associated with age, lower education, chronic illness, depression, and long COVID, regardless of covariates. DISCUSSION: GEDA 2023 is one of the few population-based studies to have collected data on fatigue. The results allow estimates to be made for Germany on the frequency of fatigue and the significance of physical, psychological, and social influencing factors. They can be used as a reference or as a basis for trends over time as part of continuous health monitoring in Germany.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative condition with observable cognitive and behavioral impairment. The Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioral ALS Screen (ECAS) is a tool developed specifically for people with ALS (pwALS) and previously translated into Russian, but the psychometric properties have not yet been explored. The aim was to explore and determine the psychometric properties of the Russian-version of ECAS (ECAS-R). METHODS: 56 Russian speaking pwALS, 32 of their caregivers and 26 healthy controls were recruited for the study. They completed the ECAS-R, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). King Staging System was also utilized. Internal consistency, divergent and convergent validity, as well as culturally-derived cutoff scores of ECAS-R were determined. RESULTS: The internal consistency of ECAS-R was good (Cronbach's alpha = 0.73). Convergent validity was observed though a strong correlation between the ECAS-R and MoCA scores. No correlation between ECAS-R and PHQ-9 were observed in terms of divergent validity. Based on culturally-derived cutoff scores, 64.2% (N = 36) of pwALS displayed cognitive impairment, with the most affected cognitive domains as executive function and language. Apathy was the most common behavioral impairment for pwALS followed by a loss of sympathy/empathy. CONCLUSIONS: The ECAS-R is valid and reliable tool for the screening for the cognitive and behavioral impairment in Russian-speaking pwALS, with culturally-derived cutoffs presented.

T1  - Co-Occurrence of Apathy and Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson Disease: Variation across Multiple Measures
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-5843
SN  - 0887-6177
Y1  - 2024/10/25
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if the co-occurrence of apathy and impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson disease is dependent on instrument selection and assess the concurrent validity of three motivation measures by examining interrelationships between them. METHOD: Ninety-seven cognitively normal individuals with idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD) completed the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS) and three apathy measures: the Apathy Scale, Lille Apathy Rating Scale, and Item 4 of the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale. RESULTS: Fifty (51.5%) participants were classified as apathetic on at least one measure, and only four individuals (4.3%) obtained clinically elevated scores on all three measures. The co-occurrence of apathy and ICD varied across measures. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a co-occurrence of apathy and ICDs in PD patients with each apathy instrument; however, limited concurrent validity exists across measures. This is important for future investigations into shared pathophysiology and the design of future clinical trials aimed at improving the early detection and treatment of these debilitating syndromes.

T1  - Applicability of a digital health application for cancer patients: a qualitative non-participation analysis
LA  - eng
SN  - 1472-6963
Y1  - 2024/10/05
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of digital health applications (German acronym DiGA) for comprehensive patient care is increasing rapidly. Patients with non-organic insomnia can be prescribed an application to manage insomnia. Due to the high prevalence of insomnia in patients with cancer, we were interested in the effect of it and what barriers need to be overcome for its use. The focus of existing studies on acceptance and benefits prompted us to emphasise the analysis of barriers and thus to formulate possible solutions. METHODS: To analyse the barriers of use, the study population (patients with self-reported tiredness or sleep disturbance via validated instruments and cancer disease) was divided into 3 groups. In groups 1 (patients who refused to participate in advance) and 2 (patients who refused a prescription), short close-ended questionnaires were used for non-response assessment by treating oncologists. Problem-centred guidelines were used for the telephone interviews with group 3 (patients who did not provide information on DiGA use). Alternatively, group 3 was invited to complete and return the close-ended questionnaire. A quantitative analysis of the non-response reasons was conducted using SPSS in groups 1 and 2, while MAXQDA was used for the qualitative data in group 3. RESULTS: Patients refused to participate at several stages of our study. Quantitative data are available for groups 1 and 2. In the largest group 1, 62% of patients refused to participate due to non-subjective sleep disturbance (177 out of 189 patients) during recruitment by treating oncologists, despite high scores on the screening tool. In the small group 2 (11 out of 15), the most common reasons for withdrawal documented by the oncologists were loss of interest and deteriorating health. The problem-centred qualitative interviews with group 3 (17 patients) revealed that some of them used the prescribed DiGA, despite not being included in the main study and being categorized as lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Analysis of barriers to DiGA use showed that reducing administrative barriers and providing digital and personal support can increase acceptance of the use of DiGAs among cancer patients. Additionally, screening tools can act as a door opener to further communication regarding DiGAs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Register of Clinical Trials DRKS00034198, registration date: 7/05/24 (retrospectively registered).

T1  - Pattern of Nonmotor Symptoms in Patients with Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease in a Tertiary Care Hospital of Rural Eastern India
LA  - eng
SN  - 0004-5772
Y1  - 2024/10/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) is associated with a spectrum of nonmotor symptoms (NMS) that contribute as much to the burden of the disease as the more obvious motor abnormalities. There is a paucity of literature determining the association between NMS and the severity of IPD, especially in rural eastern parts of India. AIMS OF STUDY: This study explores the frequency of NMS in patients with IPD and determines the association between NMS and the severity of IPD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study involving 65 serially enrolled IPD patients (diagnosed as per United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria) was conducted over a period of 18 months. The patients were evaluated for disease severity as per the Hoehn and Yahr scale (original) and were subsequently evaluated with a predesigned and validated Parkinson's Disease Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire. Pearson's Chi-squared test for independence of attributes or Fisher's exact test was used for comparison of categorical variables across the groups. Continuous variables were compared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. RESULTS: The most common presenting NMS of IPD was low mood (n = 61; 93.85%), followed by apathy (n = 59; 90.77%), impaired concentration (n = 58; 89.23%), restless leg (n = 54; 83.08%), and tenesmus (n = 54; 83.08%). A majority of the neuropsychiatric symptoms, autonomic dysfunctions, sleep abnormalities, gastrointestinal manifestations, and sensory abnormalities individually showed a statistically significant relation with the severity of IPD. CONCLUSION: Common presenting NMS include neuropsychiatric manifestations, autonomic symptoms, sleep-related symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations. Most of the NMS are significantly related to disease severity.

T1  - Symptom Network Analysis and Unsupervised Clustering of Oncology Patients Identifies Drivers of Symptom Burden and Patient Subgroups With Distinct Symptom Patterns
LA  - eng
SN  - 2045-7634
Y1  - 2024/10/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interindividual variability in oncology patients' symptom experiences poses significant challenges in prioritizing symptoms for targeted intervention(s). In this study, computational approaches were used to unbiasedly characterize the heterogeneity of the symptom experience of oncology patients to elucidate symptom patterns and drivers of symptom burden. METHODS: Severity ratings for 32 symptoms on the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale from 3088 oncology patients were analyzed. Gaussian Graphical Model symptom networks were constructed for the entire cohort and patient subgroups identified through unsupervised clustering of symptom co-severity patterns. Network characteristics were analyzed and compared using permutation-based statistical tests. Differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between subgroups were assessed using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Network analysis of the entire cohort revealed three symptom clusters: constitutional, gastrointestinal-epithelial, and psychological. Lack of energy was identified as central to the network which suggests that it plays a pivotal role in patients' overall symptom experience. Unsupervised clustering of patients based on shared symptom co-severity patterns identified six patient subgroups with distinct symptom patterns and demographic and clinical characteristics. The centrality of individual symptoms across the subgroup networks differed which suggests that different symptoms need to be prioritized for treatment within each subgroup. Age, treatment status, and performance status were the strongest determinants of subgroup membership. CONCLUSIONS: Computational approaches that combine unbiased stratification of patients and in-depth modeling of symptom relationships can capture the heterogeneity in patients' symptom experiences. When validated, the core symptoms for each of the subgroups and the associated clinical determinants may inform precision-based symptom management.

T1  - CADA-PRO: A Patient Questionnaire Measuring Key Cognitive, Motor, Emotional, and Behavioral Outcomes in CADASIL
LA  - eng
SN  - 1524-4628
Y1  - 2024/10/
ET  - 2024/09/05
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) of ischemic type, either sporadic or genetic, as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), can impact the quality of daily life on various cognitive, motor, emotional, or behavioral aspects. No instrument has been developed to measure these outcomes from the patient's perspective. We thus aimed to develop and validate a patient-reported questionnaire. METHODS: In a development study, 79 items were generated by consensus between patients, family representatives, and cSVD experts. A first sample of patients allowed assessing the feasibility (missing data, floor and ceiling effect, and acceptability), internal consistency, and dimensionality of a first set of items. Thereafter, in a validation study, we tested a reduced version of the item set in a larger sample to assess the feasibility, internal consistency, dimensionality, test-retest reliability, concurrent validity, and sensitivity to change. RESULTS: The scale was developed in 44 patients with cSVD and validated in a second sample of 89 individuals (including 43 patients with CADASIL and 46 with another cSVD). The final CADASIL Patient-Reported Outcome scale comprised 18 items covering 4 categories of consequences (depression/anxiety, attention/executive functions, motor, and daily activities) of the disease. The proportion of missing data was low, and no item displayed a major floor or ceiling effect. Both the internal consistency and test-retest reliability were good (Cronbach alpha=0.95, intraclass correlation coefficient=0.88). In patients with CADASIL, CADASIL Patient-Reported Outcome scores correlated with the modified Rankin Scale, Starkstein Apathy Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, Working Memory Index, and trail making test times. In patients with other cSVDs, CADASIL Patient-Reported Outcome correlated only with Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and Starkstein Apathy Scale. CONCLUSIONS: The CADASIL Patient-Reported Outcome may be an innovative instrument for measuring patient-reported outcomes in future cSVD trials. Full validation was obtained for its use in patients with CADASIL, but further improvement is needed for its application in other cSVDs.

T1  - Lille Apathy Rating Scale-Patient Version in Stroke Survivors: Psychometric Properties and Diagnostic Accuracy
LA  - eng
SN  - 1538-9375
Y1  - 2024/10/
ET  - 2024/08/05
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the factorial structure, psychometric properties, and diagnostic accuracy of the Persian version of the Lille Apathy Rating Scale-Patient version (LARS-P) in stroke survivors. PARTICIPANTS: This study comprised 105 stroke survivors and 41 healthy controls. METHODS AND SETTING: Exploratory factor analysis was used to determine the factors of the LARS-P. The acceptability, reliability, and validity of the LARS-P were also assessed. Agreement between the LARS-P and the Lille Apathy Rating Scale-informed version (LARS-I) was evaluated using the Bland-Altman plot. The diagnostic accuracy of the LARS-P was determined by categorizing stroke survivors into apathetic and nonapathetic groups based on the "diagnostic criteria of apathy." RESULTS: The exploratory factor analysis showed 3 factors (action initiation and social life; novelty and motivation; and emotional and self-awareness), explaining 67.35% of the variance. Cronbach's alpha was 0.85 for between-items and 0.74 for between-subscales. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC)(2,1) was >0.88 for test-retest and inter-rater reliability. The LARS-P showed moderate to strong correlations with the LARS-I and Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Apathy subscale (r = 0.70-0.82). In addition, the LARS-P had significant moderate correlations with 2 subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (r or ƿ = 0.47-0.63). There was a 96.19% agreement between LARS-P and LARS-I. The identified cutoff point (>17) for LARS-P exhibited 77.14% sensitivity and 90% specificity in diagnosing apathetic and nonapathetic stroke survivors. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The LARS-P exhibits acceptable psychometric properties in stroke survivors, presenting a promising instrument for assessing apathy through a multidimensional framework.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Psychological factors, including psychological distress and well-being, have been associated with cardiometabolic disease risk. Here, we examined whether a psychological process, namely how individuals cope with stressors, relates to such risk, which has been understudied. METHOD: During 2004-2006, 2,142 participants without heart disease and diabetes from the Midlife in the U.S. study completed a validated coping inventory assessing six strategies (positive reinterpretation and growth, active coping, planning, focus on and venting of emotion, denial, and behavioral disengagement) and relevant covariates. As a proxy for coping flexibility, participants were also classified as having lower, moderate, or greater variability in their use of these strategies. Heart disease and diabetes were documented in 2013-2015. Logistic regressions modeled adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of developing heart disease and diabetes, separately, with coping exposures. RESULTS: In sociodemographic-adjusted models, greater use of adaptive strategies predicted lower diabetes risk (e.g., positive reinterpretation and growth: AOR = 0.83; 95% CI [0.72, 0.96]); estimates were weaker for maladaptive strategies, and all strategies were unrelated to heart disease. All associations for coping variability were null. In secondary analyses, greater use of adaptive strategies predicted lower heart disease risk in more educated participants only (e.g., active coping: AOR = 0.71; 95% CI [0.55, 0.92]) and lower diabetes risk in females only (e.g., planning: AOR = 0.75; 95% CI [0.61, 0.91]). Results were maintained additionally adjusting for health, behavioral, and social factors. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest sex and education differences in coping's association with heart disease and diabetes. Future studies should recognize adaptive strategies may be more potent for health among certain populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved).

T1  - Acceptance of physical activity virtual reality games by residents of long-term care facilities: a scoping review
LA  - eng
SN  - 1748-3115
Y1  - 2024/10/
ET  - 2023/12/26
AB  - PURPOSE: This scoping review aims to identify evidence on older adults' acceptance of PA VR games in LTC facilities, describe research designs used, define key acceptance concepts, and identify knowledge gaps for future research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following Arksey and O'Malley's framework, data from published and unpublished articles (Jan 2000-May 2023) were collected. Twelve databases and additional sources were searched for studies on LTC residents (≥65 years), PA video games (including VR and console games), acceptance, and attitudes. Data extraction included article details, design, population, intervention, outcomes, and limitations. RESULTS: Five studies met inclusion criteria from 1628 initial titles. They assessed acceptance of PA VR games among older adults in LTC facilities, showing varying levels of acceptance. Most studies used analytical designs, including RCTs. Key concepts of VR acceptance were poorly defined, with only one study using a validated TAM questionnaire. Knowledge gaps highlight the need for further research to understand PA VR acceptance among older adults in LTC facilities. CONCLUSION: Validated acceptance questionnaires are needed in study of VR acceptance by older adults. Use of qualitative and quantitative methods can enhance understanding of technology acceptance, alongside exploration of individual, environmental, and age-related factors. Detailed reporting of VR interventions is recommended to comprehend acceptance factors.

T1  - Validation of a Malayalam Version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 0253-7176
SN  - 0975-1564
Y1  - 2024/09/13
AB  - BACKGROUND: The apathy evaluation scale (AES) measures apathy, but its usefulness as a screening tool in diverse populations is limited without translation into more languages. To date, there is no reported translation of the AES into Malayalam, a language spoken by over 32 million people in the southern Indian state of Kerala. In the present study, we aimed to validate the Malayalam version of the AES. METHODS: Six hundred sixty-one community-dwelling older adults without dementia participating in the Kerala Einstein study completed the Malayalam AES. We assessed the internal consistency and the validity of the Malayalam AES, using another measure of apathy, as well as measures of depression and anxiety. We also used principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the dimensionality of the Malayalam AES. Finally, we assessed possible sex differences in apathy. RESULTS: The Malayalam AES demonstrated high internal consistency and good validity, and the results of our PCA indicate that it has a three-component structure, as in the original English version and other translated versions. We found that while overall apathy scores were similar, the relationship with other neuropsychiatric symptoms differed by sex, with stronger relationships found in male participants compared to female participants. CONCLUSION: Our study provides another tool to screen for apathy in non-English-speaking populations, an important early risk factor for cognitive and functional decline, and enables future research across diverse cultures.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the level of physical activity among geriatric population, to determine the motivating factors for being active and identifying barriers that prevent participants from engaging in physical activity. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out at one of the wards within Ahmedabad city following multi-stage random sampling. The calculated sample size was 230. A pre-designed, validated, short version International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Behaviour Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-3) were used for data collection by personal interview. From selected sampling-frame, geriatric people residing in every 5th household were interviewed after obtaining oral informed consent following simple-random sampling. RESULTS: Of total 230 study participants, 67 (29.13%) were physically active (cumulative for Category 2 and Category 3), while the remaining 163 (70.87%) were found physically inactive (i.e., minimally active [Category 1]). Motivational scores, particularly in identified regulation, showed higher median scores across subdomains of the BREQ-3. Amotivation exhibited a strong negative correlation with physical activity, while intrinsic regulation displayed a strong positive correlation. CONCLUSION: More than two-third of study participants were physically inactive. Level of educational status, type of previous occupation involved, presence of addiction, BMI, electronic device usage duration per day and presence of chronic illness were statistically significant determinants to decide involvement of elderly people in category of physical activity. Amotivation, external and introjected regulation had negative correlation with physical activity, while intrinsic regulation and RAI (Relative Autonomy Index) showed positive correlation with physical activity. None of the behavioural regulators had statistically significant association with category of physical activity.

T1  - Association between apathy and caregiver burden in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a cross-sectional study
LA  - eng
SN  - 2044-6055
Y1  - 2024/09/03
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship among patients' apathy, cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, and caregiver burden in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). DESIGN: A cross-sectional study design was used. SETTING: The study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Wuhan, Hubei, China. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 109 patients with ALS and their caregivers were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients with ALS were screened using the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural Screen, Beck Depression Inventory-II, Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 and Apathy Scale to assess their cognition, depression, anxiety and apathy, respectively. The primary caregivers completed the Zarit Burden Interview. The association between apathy, cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety and caregiver burden was analysed using logistic regression. Mediation models were employed to investigate the mediating effect of patients' apathy on the relationship between depression/anxiety and caregiver burden. RESULTS: Patients in the high caregiver burden group exhibited significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety and apathy compared with those in the low caregiver burden group (p<0.05). There was a positive association observed between caregiver burden and disease course (rs=0.198, p<0.05), depression (rs=0.189, p<0.05), anxiety (rs=0.257, p<0.05) and apathy (rs=0.388, p<0.05). There was a negative association between caregiver burden and the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (rs=-0.275, p<0.05). Apathy was an independent risk factor for higher caregiver burden (OR 1.121, 95% CI 1.041 to 1.206, p<0.05). Apathy fully mediated the relationship between depression and caregiver burden (β=0.35, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.54, p<0.05) while partially mediating the relationship between anxiety and caregiver burden (β=0.34, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.52, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Apathy, depression and anxiety exerted a detrimental impact on caregiver burden in individuals with ALS. Apathy played a mediating role in the relationship between depression and caregiver burden and between anxiety and caregiver burden. These findings underscore the importance of identifying apathy and developing interventions for its management within the context of ALS.

T1  - The Starkstein Apathy Scale-Italian Version: An Update
LA  - eng
SN  - 1552-5708
Y1  - 2024/09/
ET  - 2024/01/17
AB  - Apathy can manifest in various neuropsychiatric conditions, as well as in individuals who experience significant stressful life events or suffer from underlying internal medical conditions. The Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS) is recognized as a reliable screening tool, besides being endorsed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society to assess apathy in patients with Parkinson's disease. Recently, the Italian version of this scale (SAS-I) has been introduced. Furthermore, normative data have been provided on a large sample of Italian healthy individuals. Here we present the official Italian translation of the SAS, along with clarifications regarding its administration. Also, we supply details concerning the scale's factorial structure, inter-item conditional associations and item performance by using EFA, Network analysis, and IRT modelling for polytomous items.

T1  - Development of a new patient-reported outcome measure for complex cryptoglandular fistulas (20-Item complex cryptoglandular fistula questionnaire(™)): a qualitative study
LA  - eng
SN  - 2509-8020
Y1  - 2024/08/22
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are limited tools to measure the burden of disease and effectiveness of medical/surgical interventions in patients with cryptoglandular fistulas. The aim of this study was to explore concepts that are relevant and important to patients with complex cryptoglandular fistulas (CCF) and to develop a patient-centred, disease-specific, patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) to assess symptom burden and impacts of CCF. METHODS: A targeted literature review was conducted, followed by one-to-one telephone interviews with five colorectal surgeons (USA, n = 3; UK, n = 1; Spain, n = 1) and 20 US adult patients with CCF to inform the development of a conceptual model and a CCF-specific PROM. The targeted literature review informed the development of the preliminary conceptual model and identified a PROM in the literature that was used as a reference to generate the draft CCF-specific PROM. The colorectal surgeon interviews provided insights on the experience of patients with CCF to refine the conceptual model, formulate probing questions for use in patient interviews, and to develop the draft CCF-specific PROM. Patients' descriptions of their experiences with symptoms and the impacts on their lives and evaluation of the draft CCF-specific PROM in concept elicitation and cognitive interviews were used to develop the final conceptual model and final CCF-specific PROM. RESULTS: Ten symptoms (odour, pain during bowel movement, abscess, post-operative pain, discharge/drainage/leakage, anal/perianal pain, inflammation/swelling, skin irritation, bleeding and itchiness) and 11 impacts (discomfort, inability to exercise, embarrassment, difficulty sitting, worry about disease, adapted life to maintain hygiene, negatively impacted social life/isolation, inability to perform daily activities, reduced interest in sex, negatively impacted intimate relationships and negatively impacted mood) were reported as most salient by patients. The patient experience, clinician perspective, and literature review provided input to item generation. Evaluation of relevance and patient understanding through cognitive interviews with patients provided evidence for the content validity of the new patient-reported outcome measure: the 20-item Complex Cryptoglandular Fistula Questionnaire(™) (CCFQ-20(™)). CONCLUSION: The CCFQ-20(™) is a new clinician-guided, patient-validated, disease-specific patient-reported outcome measure that measures disease impact and quality of life in patients with CCF.

T1  - Speech markers of depression dimensions across cognitive status
LA  - eng
SN  - 2352-8729
SN  - 2352-8729
Y1  - 2024/08/01
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Depression and its components significantly impact dementia prediction and severity, necessitating reliable objective measures for quantification. METHODS: We investigated associations between emotion-based speech measures (valence, arousal, and dominance) during picture descriptions and depression dimensions derived from the geriatric depression scale (GDS, dysphoria, withdrawal-apathy-vigor (WAV), anxiety, hopelessness, and subjective memory complaint). RESULTS: Higher WAV was associated with more negative valence (estimate = -0.133, p = 0.030). While interactions of apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 status with depression dimensions on emotional valence did not reach significance, there was a trend for more negative valence with higher dysphoria in those with at least one APOE4 allele (estimate = -0.404, p = 0.0846). Associations were similar irrespective of dementia severity. DISCUSSION: Our study underscores the potential utility of speech biomarkers in characterizing depression dimensions. In future research, using emotionally charged stimuli may enhance emotional measure elicitation. The role of APOE on the interaction of speech markers and depression dimensions warrants further exploration with greater sample sizes. HIGHLIGHTS: Participants reporting higher apathy used more negative words to describe a neutral picture.Those with higher dysphoria and at least one APOE4 allele also tended to use more negative words.Our results suggest the potential use of speech biomarkers in characterizing depression dimensions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diabetes is increasing globally, highlighting the importance of preventive healthcare. This study aimed to identify the diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening rates and risk factors linked to DR screening nonadherence in the Korean population through a nationally representative sample survey. METHODS: Among the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database from 2016 to 2021, participants aged ≥ 40 years with diabetes were included. The weighted estimate for nonadherence to DR screening within a year was calculated. Risk factor analyses were conducted using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among the 3,717 participants, 1,109 (29.5%) underwent DR screening within the past year, and this national estimate exhibited no statistically significant difference from 2016 to 2021 (P = 0.809). Nonadherence to annual DR screening was associated with residing in rural areas, age ≥ 80 years, low educational level, self-reported good health, absence of ocular disease, current smoking, lack of exercise and dietary diabetes treatment, and no activity limitation (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The recent DR screening rate in Korea was relatively low. Factors associated with apathy and complacency towards personal health were associated with the nonadherence to DR screening. Educational interventions have the potential to enhance the annual screening rate for diabetic patients.

T1  - Dementia Subtypes Defined Through Neuropsychiatric Symptom-Associated Brain Connectivity Patterns
LA  - eng
SN  - 2574-3805
Y1  - 2024/07/01
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Understanding the heterogeneity of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) and associated brain abnormalities is essential for effective management and treatment of dementia. OBJECTIVE: To identify dementia subtypes with distinct functional connectivity associated with neuropsychiatric subsyndromes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using data from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies-3 (OASIS-3; recruitment began in 2005) and Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; recruitment began in 2004) databases, this cross-sectional study analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, clinical assessments, and neuropsychological measures of participants aged 42 to 95 years. The fMRI data were processed from July 2022 to February 2024, with secondary analysis conducted from August 2022 to March 2024. Participants without medical conditions or medical contraindications for MRI were recruited. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A multivariate sparse canonical correlation analysis was conducted to identify functional connectivity-informed NPS subsyndromes, including behavioral and anxiety subsyndromes. Subsequently, a clustering analysis was performed on obtained latent connectivity profiles to reveal neurophysiological subtypes, and differences in abnormal connectivity and phenotypic profiles between subtypes were examined. RESULTS: Among 1098 participants in OASIS-3, 177 individuals who had fMRI and at least 1 NPS at baseline were included (78 female [44.1%]; median [IQR] age, 72 [67-78] years) as a discovery dataset. There were 2 neuropsychiatric subsyndromes identified: behavioral (r = 0.22; P = .002; P for permutation = .007) and anxiety (r = 0.19; P = .01; P for permutation = .006) subsyndromes from connectivity NPS-associated latent features. The behavioral subsyndrome was characterized by connections predominantly involving the default mode (within-network contribution by summed correlation coefficients = 54) and somatomotor (within-network contribution = 58) networks and NPSs involving nighttime behavior disturbance (R = -0.29; P < .001), agitation (R = -0.28; P = .001), and apathy (R = -0.23; P = .007). The anxiety subsyndrome mainly consisted of connections involving the visual network (within-network contribution = 53) and anxiety-related NPSs (R = 0.36; P < .001). By clustering individuals along these 2 subsyndrome-associated connectivity latent features, 3 subtypes were found (subtype 1: 45 participants; subtype 2: 43 participants; subtype 3: 66 participants). Patients with dementia of subtype 3 exhibited similar brain connectivity and cognitive behavior patterns to those of healthy individuals. However, patients with dementia of subtypes 1 and 2 had different dysfunctional connectivity profiles involving the frontoparietal control network (FPC) and somatomotor network (the difference by summed z values was 230 within the SMN and 173 between the SMN and FPC for subtype 1 and 473 between the SMN and visual network for subtype 2) compared with those of healthy individuals. These dysfunctional connectivity patterns were associated with differences in baseline dementia severity (eg, the median [IQR] of the total score of NPSs was 2 [2-7] for subtype 3 vs 6 [3-8] for subtype 1; P = .04 and 5.5 [3-11] for subtype 2; P = .03) and longitudinal progression of cognitive impairment and behavioral dysfunction (eg, the overall interaction association between time and subtypes to orientation was F = 4.88; P = .008; using the time × subtype 3 interaction item as the reference level: β = 0.05; t = 2.6 for time × subtype 2; P = .01). These findings were further validated using a replication dataset of 193 participants (127 female [65.8%]; median [IQR] age, 74 [69-77] years) consisting of 154 newly released participants from OASIS-3 and 39 participants from ADNI. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings may provide a novel framework to disentangle the neuropsychiatric and brain functional heterogeneity of dementia, offering a promising avenue to improve clinical management and facilitate the timely development of targeted interventions for patients with dementia.

T1  - Factors influencing psychological distress among breast cancer survivors using machine learning techniques
LA  - eng
SN  - 2045-2322
Y1  - 2024/07/01
AB  - Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women worldwide. Breast cancer patients experience significant distress relating to their diagnosis and treatment. Managing this distress is critical for improving the lifespan and quality of life of breast cancer survivors. This study aimed to assess the level of distress in breast cancer survivors and analyze the variables that significantly affect distress using machine learning techniques. A survey was conducted with 641 adult breast cancer patients using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer tool. Participants identified various factors that caused distress. Five machine learning models were used to predict the classification of patients into mild and severe distress groups. The survey results indicated that 57.7% of the participants experienced severe distress. The top-three best-performing models indicated that depression, dealing with a partner, housing, work/school, and fatigue are the primary indicators. Among the emotional problems, depression, fear, worry, loss of interest in regular activities, and nervousness were determined as significant predictive factors. Therefore, machine learning models can be effectively applied to determine various factors influencing distress in breast cancer patients who have completed primary treatment, thereby identifying breast cancer patients who are vulnerable to distress in clinical settings.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Impulse control disorders (ICDs) frequently occur in Parkinson's disease (PD), and an early identification is essential to prevent severe psychosocial consequences. The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS) has been developed to evaluate the severity of ICDs along with a range of impulsive-compulsive behaviors (ICBs) in PD; however, its Italian version has not yet been validated. METHODS: One hundred consecutive outpatients with PD were administered an Italian version of the QUIP-RS and a brief neuropsychological assessment to evaluate global cognitive status and scales to measure depression, apathy and impulsive disorders. We evaluated the internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity, and factorial structure of QUIP-RS. We also explored the possible association between QUIP-RS scores and clinical factors and dopaminergic medication. RESULTS: Subsyndromal ICDs manifestations were observed in 54% of the patients, and one in four (22%) reported two or more ICDs or related behaviors. The QUIP-RS demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.806) and construct validity, and its factorial structure reflected different ICDs and ICBs domains. No association emerged between QUIP-RS scores and the clinical aspects of PD and dopaminergic medication. CONCLUSION: We provided, for the first time, an Italian translation of the QUIP-RS and demonstrated its feasibility in clinical and research settings. Severity of ICDs was independent of clinical factors and dopaminergic medication, underlining the need to adopt a broader perspective on their etiopathology in PD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Associations of stress-related coping strategies with lifespan among the general population are understudied. Coping strategies are characterized as being either adaptive or maladaptive, but it is unknown the degree to which variability in tailoring their implementation to different contexts may influence lifespan. METHOD: Women (N = 54,353; M(age )= 47) completed a validated coping inventory and reported covariate information in 2001. Eight individual coping strategies (e.g., Acceptance, Denial) were considered separately. Using a standard deviation-based algorithm, participants were also classified as having lower, moderate, or greater variability in their use of these strategies. Deaths were ascertained until 2019. Accelerated failure time models estimated percent changes and 95% confidence intervals (CI) in predicted lifespan associated with coping predictors. RESULTS: In multivariable models, most adaptive and maladaptive strategies were associated with longer and shorter lifespans, respectively (e.g., per 1-SD increase: Active Coping = 4.09%, 95%CI = 1.83%, 6.41%; Behavioral Disengagement = -6.56%, 95%CI = -8.37%, -4.72%). Moderate and greater (versus lower) variability levels were similarly and significantly related to 8-10% longer lifespans. Associations were similar across age, racial/ethnic, residential income, and marital status subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Findings confirm the adaptive and maladaptive nature of specific coping strategies, and further suggest benefits from both moderate and greater variability in their use for lifespan among women.

T1  - Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Association of Clinical and Neurocognitive Factors With Apathy in Patients With Parkinson Disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1526-632X
Y1  - 2024/06/25
ET  - 2024/06/03
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A robust understanding of the natural history of apathy in Parkinson disease (PD) is foundational for developing effective clinical management tools. However, large longitudinal studies are lacking while the literature is inconsistent about even cross-sectional associations. We aimed to determine the longitudinal predictors of apathy development in a large cohort of people with PD and its cross-sectional associations and trajectories over time, using sophisticated Bayesian modeling techniques. METHODS: People with PD followed up in the longitudinal New Zealand Parkinson's progression project were included. Apathy was defined using the neuropsychiatric inventory subscale ≥4, and analyses were also repeated using a less stringent cutoff of ≥1. Both MoCA and comprehensive neuropsychological testing were used as appropriate to the model. Depression was assessed using the hospital anxiety and depression scale. Cross-sectional Bayesian regressions were conducted, and a multistate predictive model was used to identify factors that predict the initial onset of apathy in nonapathetic PD, while also accounting for the competing risk of death. The relationship between apathy presence and mortality was also investigated. RESULTS: Three hundred forty-six people with PD followed up for up to 14 years across a total of 1,392 sessions were included. Apathy occurrence did not vary significantly across the disease course (disease duration odds ratio [OR] = 0.55, [95% CI 0.28-1.12], affecting approximately 11% or 22% of people at any time depending on the NPI cutoff used. Its presence was associated with a significantly higher risk of death after controlling for all other factors (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.92 [1.50-5.66]). Lower cognition, higher depression levels, and greater motor severity predicted apathy development in those without motivational deficits (HR [cognition] = 0.66 [0.48-0.90], HR [depression] = 1.45 [1.04-2.02], HR [motor severity] = 1.37 [1.01-1.86]). Cognition and depression were also associated with apathy cross-sectionally, along with male sex and possibly lower dopaminergic therapy level, but apathy still occurred across the full spectrum of each variable (OR [cognition] = 0.58 [0.44-0.76], OR [depression] = 1.43 [1.04-1.97], OR [female sex] = 0.45 [0.22-0.92], and OR [levodopa equivalent dose] = 0.78 [0.59-1.04]. DISCUSSION: Apathy occurs across the PD time course and is associated with higher mortality. Depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment in particular predict its future development in those with normal motivation.

Y1  - 2024/06/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The 25-item Hikikomori Questionnaire (HQ-25) is an instrument developed to measure a condition characterized by extreme social withdrawal that was first described in Japan. This study aimed to translate the HQ-25 into German and validate the German version (HQ-25-G). METHODS: Translation was conducted according to established guidelines. Validation was based on data from a quota sample of individuals living in Germany, ranging from 18 to 74 years old (representing the distribution of age, sex and federal state, n = 5000). Data collection occurred during August and September 2023. We tested reliability, construct validity and concurrent validity. Moreover, HQ-25 scores for key sociodemographic group were reported. RESULTS: Internal reliability for the HQ-25-G was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.93). We confirmed the original three-factor model. Moreover, higher hikikomori levels were significantly associated with more depressive symptoms (r = 0.50), more anxiety symptoms (r = 0.45), higher loneliness levels (r = 0.56), higher levels of objective social isolation (r = -0.47), higher levels of perceived social isolation (r = 0.59) and a higher preference for solitude (r = 0.45). CONCLUSIONS: In a large population-based sample (including younger adults, middle-aged adults and older adults), the HQ-25-G version proves to be a psychometrically robust instrument, which is useful for further exploring the phenomenon of hikikomori within the German-speaking population.

T1  - Impaired facial emotion recognition in relation to social behaviours in de novo Parkinson's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1748-6653
Y1  - 2024/06/
ET  - 2023/07/24
AB  - Facial emotion recognition (FER) is a crucial component of social cognition and is essential in social-interpersonal behaviour regulation. Although FER impairment is well-established in advanced PD, data about FER at the time of diagnosis and its relationship with social behavioural problems in daily life are lacking. The aim was to examine FER at the time of PD diagnosis compared to a matched healthy control (HC) group and to associate FER with indices of social behavioural problems. In total, 142 de novo, treatment-naïve PD patients and 142 HC were included. FER was assessed by the Ekman 60 faces test (EFT). Behavioural problems in PD patients were assessed using the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX-self and DEX-proxy) and the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-self). PD patients had significantly lower EFT-total scores (p = .001) compared to HC, with worse recognition of Disgust (p = .001) and Sadness (p = .016). Correlational analyses yielded significant correlations between AES-self and both EFT-total (r(s) = .28) and Fear (r(s) = .22). Significant negative correlations were found between DEX-proxy and both EFT-total (r(s) = -.28) and Anger (r(s) = -.26). Analyses of DEX-subscales showed that proxy ratings were significantly higher than patient-ratings for the Social Conventions subscale (p = .047). This DEX-proxy subscale had the strongest correlation with EFT-total (r(s) = -.29). Results show that de novo PD patients already show impaired FER compared to HC. In addition, lower FER is linked to self-reported apathy and proxy-reported social-behavioural problems, especially concerning social conventions. These findings validate the importance of the inclusion of social cognition measures in the neuropsychological assessment even in early PD.

T1  - Prevalence and associated factors of depression among women with advanced pelvic organ prolapse in Northwest Ethiopia: cross-sectional study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1472-6874
Y1  - 2024/05/30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a symptom characterized by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, feelings of tiredness and poor concentration. One of the most common mental illnesses in the world and a major contributor to morbidity and mortality is depression. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of depression and the risk factors associated with it in women who had advanced pelvic organ prolapse. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted to determine depression among advanced pelvic organ prolapse women at Gondar University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. All women who have advanced pelvic organ prolapse were consecutively included till it reached a total of 367 participants over four months. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain the sociodemographic characteristics, clinical characteristics and depression status of the participants. Depression measures were obtained by using the Patient Health Questionnaire tool, which is validated in the Ethiopian local language for chronic illnesses including pelvic organ prolapse using a cut point of five and above, which is considered to indicate depression. Women who screened positive were linked to a psychiatric clinic for further evaluation and treatment. Data was entered into a computer using Epi Info version 3.5.3 and then exported to STATA version 14 for analysis. Multivariable logistic regressions were fitted and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals with a P value less than 0.05 were used to identify statistically significant factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression was found to be 47.1% (95% CI: 43-52%). Being rural (AOR = 4.8; CI: 1.11-16.32), having a history of divorce because of pelvic organ prolapse (AOR = 5.5; CI: 1.85-16.32) and having a history of urinary symptoms (AOR = 3.1; CI: 1.12-8.59) were found to be independently associated with depression. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depression among women with advanced pelvic organ prolapse in this study is high as compared to other studies. Depression screening strategies should be designed for the early identification and treatment of depression among women with advanced pelvic organ prolapse.

T1  - Early Detection of Depression in Parkinson's Disease: Psychometrics and Diagnostics of the Spanish Version of the Beck Depression Inventory
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-5843
Y1  - 2024/05/21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Depression is one of the most disabling non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) and requires proper diagnosis as it negatively impacts patients' and their relatives quality of life. The present study aimed to examine the psychometric and diagnostic properties of the Beck Depression Inventory-I (BDI-I) in a Spanish PD cohort. METHOD: Consecutive PD outpatients completed the Spanish version of the BDI-I and other questionnaires assessing anxiety and apathy. Patients' caregivers completed the depression/dysphoria domain of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-D). The internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity and the factorial structure of BDI-I were evaluated, and an optimal cut-off was defined by means of the Youden index. RESULTS: The BDI-I proved to have a good internal consistency and was underpinned by a mono-component structure. Regarding construct validity, the BDI-I was substantially related to anxiety and apathy measures in PD. Furthermore, the BDI-I overall showed good accuracy with adequate sensitivity and specificity. The optimal cut-off point was defined at 10. CONCLUSIONS: We provided evidence of the psychometric and diagnostic properties of the Spanish version of the BDI-I as a screening tool for depression in Spanish speaking PD patients, suggesting its usefulness in clinical research and practice.

T1  - Prevalence of depression and associated symptoms among patients attending primary healthcare facilities: a cross-sectional study in Nepal
LA  - eng
SN  - 1471-244X
Y1  - 2024/05/14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a prevalent mental health condition worldwide but there is limited data on its presentation and associated symptoms in primary care settings in low- and middle-income countries like Nepal. This study aims to assess the prevalence of depression, its hallmark and other associated symptoms that meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) criteria in primary healthcare facilities in Nepal. The collected information will be used to determine the content of a mobile app-based clinical guidelines for better detection and management of depression in primary care. METHODS: A total of 1,897 adult patients aged 18-91 (63.1% women) attending ten primary healthcare facilities in Jhapa, a district in eastern Nepal, were recruited for the study between August 2, 2021, and March 25, 2022. Trained research assistants conducted face-to-face interviews in private spaces before the consultation with healthcare providers. Depression symptoms, including hallmark symptoms, was assessed using the validated Nepali version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). RESULTS: One in seven (14.5%) individuals attending primary health care facilities in Jhapa met the threshold for depression based on a validated cut-off score ( > = 10) on the PHQ-9. The most commonly reported depressive symptoms were loss of energy and sleep difficulties. Approximately 25.4% of women and 18.9% of men endorsed at least one of the two hallmark symptoms on the PHQ-9. Using a DSM-5 algorithm (at least one hallmark symptom and five or more total symptoms) to score the PHQ-9, 6.3% of women and 4.3% of men met the criteria for depression. The intra-class correlation coefficient for PHQ-9 total scores by health facility as the unit of clustering was 0.01 (95% confidence interval, 0.00-0.04). CONCLUSION: Depression symptoms are common among people attending primary healthcare facilities in Nepal. However, the most common symptoms are not the two hallmark criteria. Use of total scores on a screening tool such as the PHQ-9 risks overestimating the prevalence and generating false positive diagnoses. Compared to using cut off scores on screening tools, training health workers to first screen for hallmark criteria may increase the accuracy of identification and lead to better allocation of treatment resources.

T1  - Machine learning approach for the development of a crucial tool in suicide prevention: The Suicide Crisis Inventory-2 (SCI-2) Short Form
LA  - eng
SN  - 1932-6203
Y1  - 2024/05/10
AB  - The Suicide Crisis Syndrome (SCS) describes a suicidal mental state marked by entrapment, affective disturbance, loss of cognitive control, hyperarousal, and social withdrawal that has predictive capacity for near-term suicidal behavior. The Suicide Crisis Inventory-2 (SCI-2), a reliable clinical tool that assesses SCS, lacks a short form for use in clinical settings which we sought to address with statistical analysis. To address this need, a community sample of 10,357 participants responded to an anonymous survey after which predictive performance for suicidal ideation (SI) and SI with preparatory behavior (SI-P) was measured using logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting algorithms. Four-fold cross-validation was used to split the dataset in 1,000 iterations. We compared rankings to the SCI-Short Form to inform the short form of the SCI-2. Logistic regression performed best in every analysis. The SI results were used to build the SCI-2-Short Form (SCI-2-SF) utilizing the two top ranking items from each SCS criterion. SHAP analysis of the SCI-2 resulted in meaningful rankings of its items. The SCI-2-SF, derived from these rankings, will be tested for predictive validity and utility in future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND:  The Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (ADLQ) focuses on assessing the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) based on the self-perception of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). A Brazilian Portuguese version of the questionnaire is available (ADLQ-Brazil), and further investigation is needed to fully assess its measurement properties. OBJECTIVE:  To investigate construct and concurrent validity of the telephone-based administration of the ADLQ-Brazil with community individuals with PD. METHODS:  There were 50 adults with PD (mean age: 68 ± 9.5 years) invited to answer the ADLQ-Brazil on two randomized occasions, face-to-face and by telephone, 7 to 10 days apart. Clinical-based measures including the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, Timed Up and Go Test, Nine Hole Peg Test, Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test, Apathy Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, and Parkinson Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire were applied during the first session, to establish construct validity. RESULTS:  The total scores on the ADLQ-Brazil were significantly associated with the clinical-based measures, thus providing evidence of construct validity. No significant differences were observed between the mean scores obtained with the face-to-face and telephone-based administration of the questionnaire (95%CI = 0.997). A high level of agreement was found in the total scores obtained between both applications of the ADLQ-Brazil (95%CI = 0.994-0.998), and most of the individual items had, on average, moderate agreement. CONCLUSION:  The findings provide psychometric support for the ADLQ-Brazil as a telephone interview to assess the performance of ADLs in individuals with PD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify whether pain and dementia-related behavior are associated with different types of activities in nursing home residents, controlled for dementia severity. DESIGN: Cross-sectional baseline data from the multicomponent cluster randomized controlled COSMOS trial (acronym for Communication, Systematic pain treatment, Medication review, Organization of activities, and Safety). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 723 patients from 33 Norwegian nursing homes with 67 units (clusters). Participants aged ≥65 years, with a life expectancy of >6 months, and with valid data on activity were eligible for inclusion. METHODS: Activity was operationalized in time (hours per week) and type (cognitive, social, physical, and no activity). Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), pain with the Mobilization-Observation-Behavior-Intensity-Dementia-2 Pain Scale (MOBID-2), and behavior with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Nursing Home version (NPI-NH). Analyses were performed using linear and logistic regression. Sensitivity analyses for dementia severity were performed to account for effect modification. RESULTS: A total of 289 participants were included (mean age 86.2 [SD 7.6]; 74% female). A higher pain score was associated with less time spent on activity in participants with severe dementia (estimate 0.897, P = .043). A higher score for the NPI-NH mood cluster (depression and anxiety) was associated with a higher likelihood of participation in cognitive activities (odds ratio [OR], 1.073; P = .039). Apathy (OR, 0.884; P = .041) and lack of inhibition (OR, 0.904; P = .042) were associated with a lower likelihood of participation in social activities as well as no engagement in activities (apathy OR, 0.880; P = .042; lack of inhibition OR, 0.894; P = .034). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Pain and dementia-related behavior may influence the participation in activities in the nursing home. There is an urgent need to investigate what type of activity stimulates people in different stages of dementia.

T1  - Measurement of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the older adults with mild cognitive impairment based on speech and facial expressions: a cross-sectional observational study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1364-6915
Y1  - 2024/05/
ET  - 2023/11/16
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between speech and facial features with depression, anxiety, and apathy in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Speech and facial expressions of 319 MCI patients were digitally recorded via audio and video recording software. Three of the most common neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) were evaluated by the Public Health Questionnaire, General Anxiety Disorder, and Apathy Evaluation Scale, respectively. Speech and facial features were extracted using the open-source data analysis toolkits. Machine learning techniques were used to validate the diagnostic power of extracted features. RESULTS: Different speech and facial features were associated with specific NPS. Depression was associated with spectral and temporal features, anxiety and apathy with frequency, energy, spectral, and temporal features. Additionally, depression was associated with facial features (action unit, AU) 10, 12, 15, 17, 25, anxiety with AU 10, 15, 17, 25, 26, 45, and apathy with AU 5, 26, 45. Significant differences in speech and facial features were observed between males and females. Based on machine learning models, the highest accuracy for detecting depression, anxiety, and apathy reached 95.8%, 96.1%, and 83.3% for males, and 87.8%, 88.2%, and 88.6% for females, respectively. CONCLUSION: Depression, anxiety, and apathy were characterized by distinct speech and facial features. The machine learning model developed in this study demonstrated good classification in detecting depression, anxiety, and apathy. A combination of audio and video may provide objective methods for the precise classification of these symptoms.

T1  - Stress and Coping in Patients With Cancer With Depression and Sleep Disturbance
LA  - eng
SN  - 1538-0688
Y1  - 2024/04/18
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate for differences in global, cancer-specific, and cumulative life stress, as well as resilience and use of various coping strategies among five groups (no depression or sleep disturbance, no depression and moderate sleep disturbance, subsyndromal depression and very high sleep disturbance, moderate depression and moderate sleep disturbance [Both Moderate]; and high depression and very high sleep disturbance [Both High]). SAMPLE &AMP; SETTING: Patients (N = 1,331) receiving chemotherapy were recruited from outpatient oncology clinics. METHODS &AMP; VARIABLES: Measures of global, cancer-specific, and cumulative life stress, resilience, and coping were obtained. Differences were evaluated using parametric and nonparametric tests. RESULTS: Global and cancer-specific stress scores increased as joint profiles worsened. Both Moderate and Both High classes had cancer-specific stress scores suggestive of post-traumatic stress. Both Moderate and Both High classes reported higher occurrence rates for several stressful life events and higher use of disengagement coping. Both Moderate and Both High classes had resilience scores below the normative score for the United States. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Clinicians need to screen vulnerable patients for post-traumatic stress disorder and implement interventions to reduce stress.

T1  - Patient-Reported Outcomes of Accelerated Aging: A Novel Approach to Investigate Second Cancer Risk in Adolescent and Young Adult (18-39 Years) Cancer Survivors
LA  - eng
SN  - 1549-490X
SN  - 1083-7159
Y1  - 2024/04/04
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adolescent and young adult cancer survivors (AYAs, aged 18-39 years at first diagnosis) have a higher second cancer risk. Accelerated aging is hypothesized as underlying mechanism and has been described clinically by 6 indicators; fatigue, low quality of sleep, low mood, lack of motivation, subjective memory complaints, and poor exercise tolerance. Using patient-reported outcomes, we aimed to identify clusters of accelerated aging among AYA cancer survivors and to investigate their association with second cancer development. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient, tumor, and treatment data were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Patient-reported clinical indicators and second cancer data were obtained from the SURVivors (5-20 years) of cancer in AYAs (SURVAYA) questionnaire study between 1999 and 2015. Latent class and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: In total, n = 3734 AYA survivors with known second cancer status (n = 278 [7.4%] second cancers) were included. Four latent clusters were identified and named based on their clinical indicator features; (1) high accelerated aging (31.3%), (2) intermediate accelerated aging without poor exercise tolerance (15.1%), (3) intermediate accelerated aging without lack of motivation (27.4%), and (4) low accelerated aging (26.2%). AYAs in the high accelerated aging cluster were more likely to have second cancer (odds ratio: 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3) compared to the low accelerated aging cluster. CONCLUSION: AYAs with a higher burden of accelerated aging were more likely to develop a second cancer. Validation of the clinical indicators and how to best capture them is needed to improve (early) detection of AYAs at high risk of developing second cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Supervised exercise therapy (SET) for patients with intermittent claudication (IC) can lower the risk of progression to chronic limb-threatening ischemia and amputation, while preserving and restoring functional status. Despite supporting evidence, it remains underutilized, and among those who initiate programs, attrition rates are extremely high. We hypothesize that socioeconomic factors may represent significant barriers to SET completion. METHODS: Patients with IC referred to SET at a multi-hospital, single-institution health care system (2018-2022) from a prospectively maintained database were retrospectively analyzed. Our primary endpoint was SET program completion and graduation, defined as completion of 36 sessions. Our secondary endpoints were vascular intervention within 1 year of referral and change in ankle-brachial index (ABI). Baseline demographics were assessed using standard statistical methods. Predictors of SET graduation were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression generating adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Change in ABI was analyzed using t-test between subgroups. Reasons for attrition were tabulated. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), metabolic equivalent level, Vascular QOL, Duke Activity Status, and ABI were analyzed using paired t-tests across the entire cohort. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients met inclusion criteria: mean age 67.85 ± 10.69 years, 19 females (36.54%), mean baseline ABI of 0.77 ± 0.16. The co-pays for 100% of patients were fully covered by primary and secondary insurance plans. Twenty-one patients (40.38%) completed SET. On multivariable analysis, residence in a ZIP code with median household income <$47,000 (aOR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-0.76; P = .03) and higher body mass index (aOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67-0.99; P = .04) were significant barriers to SET graduation. There were no differences in ABI change or vascular intervention within 1 year between graduates and non-graduates. Non-graduates reported transportation challenges (25.00%), lack of motivation (20.83%), and illness/functional limitation (20.83%) as primary reasons for SET attrition. Metabolic Equivalent Level (P ≤ .01) and Duke Activity Status scores (P = .04) were significantly greater after participating in a SET program. CONCLUSIONS: Although SET participation improves lower extremity and functionality outcomes, only 40% of referred patients completed therapy in our cohort. Our findings suggest that both socioeconomic and functional factors influence the odds of completing SET programs, indicating a need for holistic pre-referral assessment to facilitate enhanced program accessibility for these populations.

T1  - Development and validation of Unsuccessful Disengagement Aging Scale (UDAS) for older adults
LA  - eng
SN  - 1940-0888
Y1  - 2024///Apr-Jun
ET  - 2023/08/06
AB  - The present study aimed to develop a precise and reliable measure of unsuccessful disengagement among older adults, defined as involuntary withdrawal from societal roles and norms due to familial or societal pressure, resulting in the transfer of responsibilities to the younger generation. High scores on the Unsuccessful Disengagement Aging Scale (UDAS) were indicative of a greater degree of unsuccessful disengagement. The study was conducted in two parts: Study I involved a purposive sample of 200 participants, whereas Study II involved a purposive sample of 500 occupationally retired older adults aged between 65 and 85 years. The constructs of the study were measured using the UDAS, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale, and Identity and Experiences Scale. In Study I, the UDAS was subjected to an Exploratory Factor Analysis, which revealed a clear four-factor solution with high factor loadings and internally consistent factors. This factor structure was confirmed through Confirmatory Factor Analysis in Study II. Construct validity was established through the UDAS's significant positive correlation with depression and non-significant correlation with assimilation identity style. Furthermore, the mean UDAS score of older adults suffering from chronic physical ailments such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiac problems, hepatitis, ulcers, liver problems, arthritis, and joint pain was significantly higher than that of healthy older adults, indicating the concurrent validity of the UDAS in distinguishing between ill and healthy older adults. Overall, the results indicated that the UDAS was a reliable and valid instrument for measuring unsuccessful disengagement in older adults.

T1  - Development and validation of the geriatric apathy scale: Examining multi-dimensional apathy profiles in a neurodegenerative population with cultural considerations
LA  - eng
SN  - 1876-2026
Y1  - 2024/03/
ET  - 2024/01/09
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a common motivational deficit in neurodegenerative diseases, but lacks a culturally sensitive tool accounting for ethnic Chinese culture's impact on motivation initiation. This study developed and validated the Geriatric Apathy Scale (GAS), comprehensively incorporating cultural nuances, setting diagnostic cutoffs, and examining apathy's multi-dimensional aspects in a neurodegenerative cohort. METHODS: The 16-item GAS was developed by considering ethnic Chinese cultural characteristics and conducting a literature review. The study involved 296 participants, comprising 113 with Parkinson's disease (PD), 66 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 117 healthy controls (HC). All participants completed the GAS, Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), Mini-Mental State Examination, and Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). RESULTS: The GAS showed good internal consistency (r = 0.862) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.767). It correlated moderately with the AES (r = 0.639, p < .001), weakly with GDS-15 (r = 0.166, p < .01), and negatively with ADLs (r = -1.19, p < .05). Clinical diagnosis cutoff scores were identified at 15.5 for PD (sensitivity: 0.789; specificity: 0.693) and 12.5 for AD (sensitivity: 0.821; specificity: 0.632). Noteworthy disparities were observed in the Cognition and Social Motivation dimension, with elevated severity in both PD and AD compared to HC (p < .01). Interestingly, within-group comparisons revealed greater apathy severity in the Cognition and Social Motivation dimension for PD (p < .001) and AD (p = .001) versus Emotional Response and Expression and Spontaneous Behavioral Activation. CONCLUSIONS: The GAS, a psychometrically validated scale, assesses apathy in neurodegenerative populations, accounting for ethnic Chinese culture's influence. It establishes clinical cutoff points and explores the multi-dimensional nature of apathy.

T1  - Cultural adaptation and validation of the Sinhala version of the Frail Non-disabled tool (FiND)
LA  - eng
SN  - 1471-2318
Y1  - 2024/02/14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty, a common geriatric syndrome of vulnerability, is associated with a decline in health and function. The most problematic expression of population ageing is associated with weakness, slowing, decreased energy, lower activity and when severe, unintended weight loss. Frailty is not consciously identified in clinical practice and is not widely studied in Sri Lanka. A validated tool for screening frailty in a busy clinical setting is therefore much needed. This study was done as a part of validating the Sinhala version of the Frail Non-Disabled (S-FiND) tool. METHODS: The FiND tool was translated from English to Sinhala by two translators, blinded to each other. They were combined and translated back to the original language by two separate translators. After verifying the content validity, unambiguity and clarity of items in a focused group discussion, the pre-final version was piloted among 30 volunteers. After assessing the psychometric properties of the pre-final version, the final version was tested among 100 adults older than 65 years from the Colombo South Teaching Hospital. The tool was compared with Fried's frailty phenotype taken as the gold standard. RESULTS: Data were analysed for the agreement with the reference standard, the Fried Phenotype. The mean (SD) age of subjects was 73.9 (7.8) years. The overall time taken to fill out the questionnaire was 2 min. The agreement (Kappa) between the S-FiND questionnaire and the Fried phenotype was 0.7 (P < 001). The sensitivity and specificity of FiND in detecting frailty were 92% and 74%, respectively. The agreements (Kappa) between the individual items of S-Find: involuntary loss of weight/ more than 4.5 kg over one year, the feeling of effort/ not getting going and level of physical activity, with the Fried phenotype, were 0.28 (p = 0.001), 0.06 (p = 0.045) and 0.339 (p < 0.001). respectively. When subjects were categorized frail and robust based on FiND, frail subjects reported a higher incidence of falls (50%) during the previous 12 months, compared to those robust (13%) (p < 0.001 for Chi stat). CONCLUSION: The S-FiND is a reliable, valid and well-received tool that can be used in detecting the frailty of non-disabled Sinhala-speaking older adults.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: It is important to study apathy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) to better understand its underlying neurobiology and develop effective interventions. In the current study, we sought to examine the relationships between longitudinal apathy and regional tau burden in cognitively impaired older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. METHODS: Three hundred and nineteen ADNI participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD dementia underwent flortaucipir (FTP) tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and clinical assessment with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) annually. Longitudinal NPI Apathy (NPI-A) scores were examined in relation to baseline tau PET signal in three a priori selected regions implicated in AD and AD-related apathy (supramarginal gyrus, entorhinal cortex [EC] and rostral anterior cingulate cortex [rACC]). Secondary models were adjusted for global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination score) and cortical amyloid (florbetapir PET). RESULTS: Higher baseline supramarginal gyrus and EC tau burden were each significantly associated with greater NPI-A over time, while rACC tau was associated with higher NPI-A but did not predict its trajectory over time. These results were retained for supramarginal and EC tau after adjusting models for global cognition and cortical amyloid. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that baseline in vivo tau burden in parietal and temporal brain regions affected in AD, and less so in a medial frontal region involved in motivational control, is associated with increasing apathy over time in older adults with MCI and AD dementia. Future work studying emergent apathy in relation to not only core AD pathology but also circuit level dysfunction may provide additional insight into the neurobiology of apathy in AD and opportunities for intervention. HIGHLIGHTS: Tau (Flortaucipir PET) in regions implicated in AD was associated with increasing apathy over timeCortical amyloid was also found to be a robust predictor of the trajectory of apathyEvidence of synergy between regional tau and amyloid in overall higher levels of apathy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Late-life psychological symptoms in older adults such as depression and apathy have been increasingly associated with increased risk of cognitive and functional decline. The goal of this study was to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), pooling 3 unique cohorts of older adults to 1) develop a novel measurement model that distinguishes apathy from other domains of depression including dysphoria and cognitive concern and 2) evaluate if the measurement model distinguishes older adult populations with varied risk for cognitive decline. METHODS: We pooled the baseline waves of three older adult cohorts (N=1421). With the aim of partitioning apathy from other constructs that compose the GDS and with a PCA suggesting 3-component solution, we then conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using lavaan and less R. RESULTS: CFA yielded 3 factors: dysphoria, apathy, and cognitive concern. All the dysphoria, apathy, and cognitive concern factors showed acceptable unidimensionality with α=.76, .59, and .54, respectively. The Cognitive Risk Primary Care cohort had significantly higher mean dysphoria, apathy and cognitive concern scales. CONCLUSIONS: This culturally, linguistically, and educationally diverse sample population yielded factors with acceptable reliability and good face validity. This strategy has resulted in a generalizable measurement model to identify people at risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. In particular, the apathy scale score can be used to identify older adults at risk for cognitive and functional decline across research and clinical settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of mild behavioral impairment (MBI ) in elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI ), refine diagnostic criteria, and characterize the identified neuropsychiatric symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-three individuals over 50 years of age (median 72 [68; 77]) with MCI underwent psychiatric and psychometric assessments using clinical and psychopathological methods and scales. Statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate intergroup differences, ROC-analysis with calculation of the area under the curve (AUC) was performed, and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MBI diagnosis were determined for MBI-C. RESULTS: The prevalence of MBI using only ISTAART research criteria was 65%. An optimal diagnostic cut point for the MBI-C scale with the highest AUC (0.793), at 10 points, was identified. Upon a comprehensive assessment of MBI using criteria and optimal cut point values from the MBI-C scale, the prevalence was 33% (median 16 [14; 20]). Patients with MBI+MCI and MCI only did not significantly differ in MMSE and MoCA test results. Significant intergroup differences were observed in the severity of symptoms such as apathy (p<0.001), depression and anxiety (p<0.001), agitation and impulsivity (p<0.001), social behavioral disturbances (p=0.009), and subsyndromal psychotic symptoms (p<0.001). The most common symptoms were related to impulse control deficits, irritability, agitation, depression, anxiety, and apathy, while less common symptoms were associated with social behavioral disturbances and subsyndromal psychotic symptoms. CONCLUSION: Novel data on the diagnostic features of MBI in elderly patients with MCI in the Russian-speaking population are presented. An optimal diagnostic cut point for the MBI-C scale in a sample of patients from specialized clinics for comprehensive use with commonly accepted criteria was determined. Further research is needed to adapt and validate the MBI-C scale and provide prognostic evaluation of MBI in the context of MCI progression to dementia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) and loneliness are associated with cognitive decline and an increased risk of dementia. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine the validity of the Japanese version of the MBI checklist (MBI-C) and investigate the relationship between loneliness and MBI. METHODS: The participants in this cross-sectional study included 5 cognitively normal persons and 75 persons with mild cognitive impairment. MBI-C and the revised University of California at Los Angeles loneliness scale (LS) were used to assess MBI and loneliness, respectively. Diagnostic performance of MBI-C was examined using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The relationship between MBI-C and LS was examined using multiple linear regression in 67 subjects who were assessed with both scales, with MBI-C total or domain score as the dependent variable and LS as the independent variable, adjusted for age, gender, living situation, presence of visual and hearing impairment, and Mini-Mental State Examination score. RESULTS: Per the Youden index, in this mostly MCI sample, the optimal MBI-C cut-off score was 5.5 with sensitivity 0.917 and specificity 0.949. In multiple linear regression analysis, LS score was detected as a significant predictor of MBI-C total scores, and MBI-C decreased motivation, affective dysregulation, and abnormal thought and perception scores. CONCLUSIONS: The caregiver-rated Japanese MBI-C has excellent diagnostic performance. Loneliness is associated with a greater MBI burden, especially in the decreased motivation, affective dysregulation, and abnormal thought and perception domains. Interventions for loneliness in older people may have the potential to improve MBI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test the psychometric properties of the Portuguese Supportive Care Needs Survey-Short Form-34 (SCNS-SF34-Pt) and its breast cancer-specific complementary module (SCNS-BR8-Pt). A further aim was to characterize Portuguese Breast Cancer Survivors' (BCS) unmet supportive care needs, using these measures. METHODS: A convenient sample of BCS was recruited from five hospitals in Portugal and invited to complete SCNS-SF34-Pt and SCNS-BR8-Pt, EORTCQLQC30 and QLQBR23, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and the Patient Health-Questionnaire. The validity (i.e. convergent, discriminant and convergent validity) and reliability of SCNS-SF34-Pt and SCNS-BR8-Pt were statistically evaluated. BCS' unmet supportive care needs were descriptively assessed. FINDINGS: 336 BCS participated in the study. A four-factor solution was produced for SCNS-SF34-Pt. This solution included the Physical and daily living needs, Psychological needs, Sexuality needs, and Health system, information, and patient support needs dimensions (73% of the total variance; Cronbach's alpha=.82 to .97). SCNS-SF34-Pt demonstrated good convergent validity. It could also discriminate between known-groups regarding age, disease staging, treatment performed, and ECOG performance status. SCNS-BR8-Pt revealed a single-factor structure (62% of the total variance; Cronbach's alpha=.91).Portuguese BCS' most prevalent unmet supportive care needs were associated with the Psychological, and Physical and daily living domains. Fear of cancer spreading, the inability to do things as usual, and lack of energy/tiredness were perceived as issues requiring further supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: SCNS-SF34-Pt and the SCNS-BR8-Pt are valid and reliable tools to assess Portuguese BCS' unmet supportive care needs. Fear of cancer spreading and lack of energy/tiredness concerns should be a target of supportive care services.

T1  - Symptom Burden of Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Attending the Westmead Breathlessness Service: Prevalence, Associations, and Sex-Related Differences
LA  - eng

Y1  - 2023/11/30
AB  - PURPOSE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disease resulting in a range of symptoms including breathlessness. "Symptom burden" describes the severity and impact of multiple symptoms in an individual and is best quantified using validated symptom instruments but is not routinely measured in clinical practice. Therefore, we wanted to assess overall symptom burden in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD and find associated independent predictors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single-centre cross-sectional study of patients with COPD who attended the Westmead Breathlessness Service between March 2017 and May 2022 was conducted. We obtained baseline demographic data, lung function, assessed quality of life (CAT), anxiety/depression (HADS), and measured symptom burden (CMSAS). We compared variables between men and women using unpaired t tests or Mann-Whitney tests for continuous variables, and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. We used multiple regression to look for independent predictors of overall symptom burden. Data were analysed using Stata/IC 15.1. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients with COPD, mean age 72.6 years, 55% male, mean FEV(1) 32% predicted, reported an average of 8.9 symptoms including 6.9 physical and 1.6 psychological symptoms. The most common physical symptoms were shortness of breath (100%) and lack of energy (80%), and the most common psychological symptoms were worrying (65%) and feeling anxious (61%). Median CMSAS total score was higher in women than men (1.34 versus 1.04, respectively; p=0.03) with more women experiencing nervousness (p=0.011) and anxiety (p=0.005). Female sex (p=0.003), HADS-Anxiety (p=0.0001), and HADS-Depression (p=0.0001) were independently associated with total CMSAS score in a multiple linear regression model and explained 63% of total CMSAS variability. CONCLUSION: Very high physical and psychological symptom burden exists among patients with severe COPD. Anxiety, depression, and female sex were independently associated with increasing symptom burden. Identifying and understanding sex differences for COPD symptoms, and interventions targeting anxiety and depression may help to reduce overall symptom burden within this population.

T1  - Long-term psychological outcomes following stroke: the OX-CHRONIC study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1471-2377
Y1  - 2023/11/30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke survivors rate longer-term (> 2 years) psychological recovery as their top priority, but data on how frequently psychological consequences occur is lacking. Prevalence of cognitive impairment, depression/anxiety, fatigue, apathy and related psychological outcomes, and whether rates are stable in long-term stroke, is unknown. METHODS: N = 105 long-term stroke survivors (M [SD] age = 72.92 [13.01]; M [SD] acute NIH Stroke Severity Score = 7.39 [6.25]; 59.0% Male; M [SD] years post-stroke = 4.57 [2.12]) were recruited (potential N = 208). Participants completed 3 remote assessments, including a comprehensive set of standardized cognitive neuropsychological tests comprising domains of memory, attention, language, and executive function, and questionnaires on emotional distress, fatigue, apathy and other psychological outcomes. Ninety participants were re-assessed one year later. Stability of outcomes was assessed by Cohen's d effect size estimates and percent Minimal Clinically Important Difference changes between time points. RESULTS: On the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 65.3% scored < 26. On the Oxford Cognitive Screen 45.9% had at least one cognitive impairment. Attention (27.1%) and executive function (40%) were most frequently impaired. 23.5% and 22.5% had elevated depression/anxiety respectively. Fatigue (51.4%) and apathy (40.5%) rates remained high, comparable to estimates in the first-year post-stroke. Attention (d = -0.12; 85.8% stable) and depression (d = 0.09, 77.1% stable) were the most stable outcomes. Following alpha-adjustments, only perceptuomotor abilities (d = 0.69; 40.4% decline) and fatigue (d = -0.33; 45.3% decline) worsened over one year. Cognitive impairment, depression/anxiety, fatigue and apathy all correlated with worse quality of life. CONCLUSION: Nearly half of participants > 2 years post-event exhibited psychological difficulties including domains of cognition, mood, and fatigue, which impact long-term quality of life. Stroke is a chronic condition with highly prevalent psychological needs, which require monitoring and intervention development.

T1  - Is the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire a Valid Measure in Older People?
LA  - eng
SN  - 2227-9032
SN  - 2227-9032
Y1  - 2023/10/10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the widely recognized benefits of physical activity for preventing physical and cognitive decline during aging, global estimates indicate that most older adults do not achieve the recommended amount of physical activity due to a lack of motivation. The current research examined the validity and psychometric properties of the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-3) among older adults. Based on Self-Determination Theory (SDT), the BREQ-3 stands out as one of the most extensively utilized tools among exercise motivation studies. METHODS: A sample of older adults (N = 383; M age = 73.2 years, SD age = 7.2) completed the BREQ-3 and the Godin-Shepard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (GSLTPAQ). RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the six-factor structure postulated by SDT, showing good fit indices (CFI= 0.95; RMSEA = 0.05; SRMR = 0.04) and supporting the full measurement invariance of the scale across sex and age groups (65 to 74 years; over 75 years). The construct and criterion validity of the BREQ-3 was upheld through the latent correlations between its subscales and their correlations with the GSLTPAQ. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated for the first time the effectiveness of the BREQ-3 in assessing all forms of behavioral regulation proposed by SDT in older adults, suggesting that older adults similarly interpreted the items across sex and age groups.

AB  - Environmental hazards and/or pandemics may push humans to use different protective methods to maintain their well-being. This study aimed to identify populations vulnerable to psychometric challenges and fatigue during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Kazakhstan. A total of 1,592 participants were recruited and asked to complete the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 (MFI-20). Participants were classified according to gender and age. Data were analyzed using the Chi-square test (x2) and MedCalc to detect the odds of MFI-scales with a score ≥12 in women compared to men. Young women had significantly higher odds (OR) of reduced activity (OR 2.4, p<0.0001), physical (OR 2.5, p<0.0001), and mental fatigue (OR 3.4, p<0.0001) than young men. Middle-aged women had significantly higher odds of general fatigue (OR 2.1; p<0.0001), reduced motivation (OR 2.1, p<0.0001), physical (OR 2.1, p<0.0001), and mental fatigue (OR 1.9, p<0.0001) than did middle-aged men. Elderly women had significantly higher odds of general fatigue (OR 3.6, p<0.0001), reduced motivation (OR 3.5, p<0.0001), and physical fatigue (OR 3.5, p<0.0001) than men in the same age category. The study highlights that women were more susceptible, with significantly increased odds of experiencing various aspects of fatigue syndrome compared to men during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kazakhstan. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate individual behavioral changes to help identify vulnerable populations and provide relevant evidence for developing protocols and guidelines during pandemics and/or outbreaks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression, anxiety, and apathy are highly prevalent in older people with preclinical dementia and mild cognitive impairment. These symptoms have also proven valuable in predicting the progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, enabling a timely diagnosis and treatment. However, objective and reliable indicators to detect and distinguish depression, anxiety, and apathy are relatively scarce. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a machine learning model to detect and distinguish depression, anxiety, and apathy based on speech and facial expressions. DESIGN: An observational, cross-sectional study design. SETTING(S): The memory outpatient department of a tertiary hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 319 older adults diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. METHODS: Depression, anxiety, and apathy were evaluated by the Public Health Questionnaire, General Anxiety Disorder, and Apathy Evaluation Scale, respectively. Speech and facial expressions of older adults with mild cognitive impairment were digitally captured using audio and video recording software. Open-source data analysis toolkits were utilized to extract speech, facial, and text features. The multiclass classification was used to develop classification models, and shapely additive explanations were used to explain the contribution of each feature within the model. RESULTS: The random forest method was used to develop a multiclass emotion classification model, which performed well in classifying emotions with a weighted-average F1 score of 96.6 %. The model also demonstrated high accuracy, precision, and recall, with 87.4 %, 86.6 %, and 87.6 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning model developed in this study demonstrated strong classification performance in detecting and differentiating depression, anxiety, and apathy. This innovative approach combines text, audio, and video to provide objective methods for precise classification and remote monitoring of these symptoms in nursing practice. REGISTRATION: This study was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR1900023892; registration date: June 19th, 2019).

T1  - Potential impacts of Russo-Ukraine conflict and its psychological consequences among Ukrainian adults: the post-COVID-19 era
LA  - eng
SN  - 2296-2565
Y1  - 2023/09/28
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since February 2022, the nation of Ukraine has become entangled in an escalating conflict that erupted after coronavirus outbreak fostering a situation of indeterminacy and precariousness, which adversely affected several facets, especially psychological well-being. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the psychological well-being of Ukrainians during the Russo-Ukraine war, as well as their coping strategies in response to the war's repercussions. Consequently, this investigation endeavors to explore the prevalence of symptoms associated with depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia and to correlate these symptoms with Ukrainians' effective coping mechanisms during the ongoing war. METHODS: An online survey was administered in Ukraine from June to August 2022 due to the ongoing Russo-Ukraine conflict. The survey employed a quota sampling technique, targeting 2,664 individuals (≥18 years). Out of the total sample, 1,833 valid responses were obtained, yielding a response rate of 68. 81%. Depression, anxiety, and stress were measured using the depression, anxiety, and stress scale-21 (DASS-21), while the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) was utilized to evaluate insomnia symptoms. In addition, Brief-COPE was adopted to evaluate the coping mechanisms of the selected study participants. RESULTS: Of 1,833 Ukrainian adults, 60.5% had symptoms of stress; 62.4% of them reported symptoms of anxiety; and 58.2% reported symptoms of depression. Symptom criteria for insomnia were found in about 21.8% of the study sample. The factors of sex, living area, area occupied by Russian forces, and having older adults and children in the house were statistically significant with symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia. The productive coping strategies of self-distraction, using instrumental support, planning, and behavioral disengagement, were observed as statistically significant with four psychological constructs. CONCLUSION: The study outcomes highlight a substantial prevalence of symptoms related to depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia attributed to the accumulated consequences of ongoing conflict and the COVID-19 outbreak. The aforementioned findings emphasize the imperative of providing healthcare services and facilitating effective coping strategies among Ukrainians amid the ongoing war.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Empathic Accuracy Task (EAT) is an objective measure to assess empathic accuracy. Due to the variability in the number and linked emotions of the narrated events, we adapted EAT for the Indian sociocultural setting as Indian EAT (I-EAT). METHODS: Eight videos were adapted in three languages (English, Hindi, and Kannada), narrating emotional events with a uniform representation of age groups, different emotions, and sex. The adapted I-EAT was then validated by cross-sectional comparison with different tests similar to EAT and those that assessed concepts different from or similar to empathy, in 29 healthy young adults, 23 healthy older adults (aged ≥60 years) along with clinical groups of 15 young people with depression, 15 older people with depression, and 15 young people with schizophrenia. RESULTS: We selected eight videos with good content validity and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.73. We obtained satisfactory concurrent validity of the EAT scores with the self-reported empathic assessments using the Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (Cognitive empathy score = 0.29, p = .034; Total score = 0.29, p = .035) and Interpersonal Reactivity Index (Empathic concern score = 0.45, p = .001). Good divergent validity was revealed in the high inverse correlation recorded with the Apathy Evaluation Scale ( = -0.67, p < .001). I-EAT did not correlate significantly with measures of social cognition. Known-groups validity was adequate in young adults with the significantly lower EAT scores (Cohen's d: 0.77 to 1.15) in the Schizophrenia group and higher EAT-N scores (Cohen's d: 0.51) in the Depression group, compared to the Healthy group. The Healthy group of the geriatric population also achieved significantly higher EAT scores (Cohen's d: 0.71 to 0.85) than the Depression group. CONCLUSION: With a good validity and internal consistency, I-EAT can be used in the Indian population to assess empathic accuracy without compromising performance of the original EAT.

T1  - Health-related quality of life and mild behavioral impairment in older adults without dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 1099-1166
Y1  - 2023/09/
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C) was developed to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and to identify mild behavioral impairment (MBI). This study validated the Taiwanese version of the MBI-C and examined its association of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). METHODS: We recruited 242 older individuals without dementia (129 amnestic mild cognitive impairment, 113 cognitively normal). Their family completed the MBI-C, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), and instrumental activities of daily living scale. Participants completed the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), the Mini-Mental State Examination, the 12-item word recall test, the category verbal fluency test and the EuroQol 5 dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D). Cronbach's α was used to evaluate the internal consistency of the MBI-C. Linear regression models were used to examined the association between MBI-C score and HR-QoL assessed using ED-5D. RESULTS: The prevalence of MBI was 12% of all participants. Cronbach's α of the MBI-C was 0.893. The optimal cut-off point of MBI-C was 7.5 for identifying MBI, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 85%. The MBI-C total score (β = -0.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.02 to -0.01, p < 0.001), MBI-C subdomain of decreased motivation (β = -0.04, 95% CI = -0.05 to -0.02, p < 0.001) and emotional dysregulation (β = -0.02, 95% CI = -0.04 to -0.004, p = 0.01) were factors related to EQ-5D index scores. CONCLUSION: Among older adults without dementia, the Taiwanese version of the MBI-C has good reliability and validity for detecting MBI. The total and subdomains of MBI-C were associated with decreased HR-QoL among individuals without dementia.

T1  - Cognitive impairments predict the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 1664-2295
SN  - 1664-2295
Y1  - 2023/07/20
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to (1) validate the Thai version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) as a screening tool for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and (2) examine the relationship between cognitive performance and BPSD in an elderly population with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT). METHODS: One hundred and twenty participants, comprising 80 aMCI and 40 DAT patients, and their respective caregivers were included in the study. Participants completed the NPI-Q and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) within 2 weeks of each other and cognitive performance was primarily assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). RESULTS: The Thai NPI-Q had good validity and reliability. Pure exploratory bifactor analysis revealed that a general factor and a single-group factor (with high loadings on delusions, hallucinations, apathy, and appetite) underpinned the NPI-Q domains. Significant negative correlations between the MoCA total score and the general and single-group NPI-Q scores were found in all subjects (aMCI + DAT combined) and DAT alone, but not in aMCI. Cluster analysis allocated subjects with BPSD (10% of aMCI and 50% of DAT participants) into a distinct "DAT + BPSD" class. CONCLUSION: The NPI-Q is an appropriate instrument for assessing BPSD and the total score is largely predicted by cognitive deficits. It is plausible that aMCI subjects with severe NPI-Q symptoms (10% of our sample) may have a poorer prognosis and constitute a subgroup of aMCI patients who will likely convert into probable dementia.

T1  - Dissociable effects of dopaminergic medications on depression symptom dimensions in Parkinson's disease
LA  - eng
Y1  - 2023/06/30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression in Parkinson's disease (PD) is common, disabling and responds poorly to standard antidepressant medication. Motivational symptoms of depression, such as apathy and anhedonia, are particularly prevalent in depression in PD and predict poor response to antidepressant treatment. Loss of dopaminergic innervation of the striatum is associated with emergence of motivational symptoms in PD, and mood fluctuations correlate with dopamine availability. Accordingly, optimising dopaminergic treatment for PD can improve depressive symptoms, and dopamine agonists have shown promising effects in improving apathy. However, the differential effect of antiparkinsonian medication on symptom dimensions of depression is not known. AIMS: We hypothesised that there would be dissociable effects of dopaminergic medications on different depression symptom dimensions. We predicted that dopaminergic medication would specifically improve motivational symptoms, but not other symptoms, of depression. We also hypothesised that antidepressant effects of dopaminergic medications with mechanisms of action reliant on pre-synaptic dopamine neuron integrity would attenuate as pre-synaptic dopaminergic neurodegeneration progresses. METHODS: We analysed data from a longitudinal study of 412 newly diagnosed PD patients followed over five years in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort. Medication state for individual classes of Parkinson's medications was recorded annually. Previously validated "motivation" and "depression" dimensions were derived from the 15-item geriatric depression scale. Dopaminergic neurodegeneration was measured using repeated striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging. RESULTS: Linear mixed-effects modelling was performed across all simultaneously acquired data points. Dopamine agonist use was associated with relatively fewer motivation symptoms as time progressed (interaction: β=-0.07, 95%CI [-0.13,-0.01], p=0.015) but had no effect on the depression symptom dimension (p=0.6). In contrast, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor use was associated with relatively fewer depression symptoms across all years (β=-0.41, 95%CI [-0.81,-0.01], p=0.047). No associations were observed between either depression or motivation symptoms and levodopa or amantadine use. There was a significant interaction between striatal DAT binding and MAO-B inhibitor use on motivation symptoms: MAO-B inhibitor use was associated with lower motivation symptoms in patients with higher striatal DAT binding (interaction: β=-0.24, 95%CI [-0.43, -0.05], p=0.012). No other medication effects were moderated by striatal DAT binding measures. CONCLUSIONS: We identified dissociable associations between dopaminergic medications and different dimensions of depression in PD. Dopamine agonists may be effective for treatment of motivational symptoms of depression. In contrast, MAO-B inhibitors may improve both depressive and motivation symptoms, albeit the latter effect appears to be attenuated in patients with more severe striatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration, which may be a consequence of dependence on pre-synaptic dopaminergic neuron integrity.

T1  - Mental health symptoms and coping strategies among Ukrainians during the Russia-Ukraine war in March 2022
LA  - eng
SN  - 1741-2854
Y1  - 2023/06/
ET  - 2023/01/04
AB  - CONTEXT: The Russian attack on Ukraine has been ongoing since February 24, 2022. Nevertheless, no research has documented the mental health of Ukrainians during the biggest land war in Europe after the Second World War, or how Ukrainians cope with the impact of the war. OBJECTIVES: To provide the prevalence rates of symptoms of psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia; and to link them with Ukrainians' productive coping strategies during the war. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Online survey conducted in Ukraine during the initial period of the Russian invasion (March 19-31, 2022), using a quota sampling method, of 1,400 Ukrainians aged 18 years or older, with a total of 801 valid responses for a response rate of 57.2%. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Psychological distress assessed by the Kessler Psychological Distress scale (K6); anxiety assessed by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2) scale; depression assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2); insomnia assessed by Insomnia Severity Index-4 (ISI-4); modes of coping assessed by Brief COPE. RESULTS: Of 801 Ukrainian adults, 52.7% had symptoms of psychological distress (mean = 13.3 [SD = 4.9]); 54.1% of them reported symptoms of anxiety (mean = 2.9 [SD = 1.7]); 46.8% reported symptoms of depression (mean = 2.6 [SD = 1.6]). Symptom criteria for insomnia were met by 97 respondents (12.1%) (mean = 10.4 [SD = 4.2]). Demographic variables (including gender, living in an urban area, having children or elderly persons in the household, living in an area occupied by Russian forces) were associated with symptoms of distress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The productive coping strategies of using instrumental support, behavioral disengagement, self-distraction, and planning were significantly associated with mental health symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence rates of symptoms of psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia were high. These findings underscore the need for healthcare and productive coping strategies for Ukrainians during the war.

T1  - Mid- and Late-Life Physical Activity and Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Dementia-Free Older Adults: Mayo Clinic Study of Aging
LA  - eng
SN  - 1545-7222
Y1  - 2023///Spring
ET  - 2022/12/05
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined associations between physical activity (PA) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in older adults free of dementia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 3,222 individuals ≥70 years of age (1,655 men; mean±SD age=79.2±5.6; cognitively unimpaired, N=2,723; mild cognitive impairment, N=499) from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. PA (taken as a presumed predictor) in midlife (i.e., when participants were 50-65 years of age) and late life (i.e., the year prior to assessment) was assessed with a self-reported, validated questionnaire; PA intensity and frequency were used to calculate composite scores. NPS (taken as presumed outcomes) were assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Regression analyses included midlife and late-life PA in each model, which were adjusted for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E ɛ4 status, and medical comorbidity. RESULTS: Higher late-life PA was associated with lower odds of having apathy (OR=0.89, 95% CI=0.84-0.93), appetite changes (OR=0.92, 95% CI=0.87-0.98), nighttime disturbances (OR=0.95, 95% CI=0.91-0.99), depression (OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.90-0.97), irritability (OR=0.93, 95% CI=0.89-0.97), clinical depression (OR=0.92, 95% CI=0.88-0.97), and clinical anxiety (OR=0.90, 95% CI=0.86-0.94), as well as lower BDI-II (β estimate=-0.042, 95% CI=-0.051 to -0.033) and BAI (β estimate=-0.030, 95% CI=-0.040 to -0.021) scores. Higher midlife PA was associated only with higher BDI-II scores (β estimate=0.011, 95% CI=0.004 to 0.019). Sex modified the associations between PA and NPS. CONCLUSIONS: Late-life PA was associated with a lower likelihood of clinical depression or anxiety and subclinical NPS. These findings need to be confirmed in a cohort study.

T1  - Engagement in a structured physical activity program and its effects upon health-related quality of life in elderly women: An observational study

AB  - Aging is a complex process associated with an impairment in functional capacity and low health-related quality of life (HRQoL) due to a high frequency of chronic diseases in the elderly population. Regular physical activity (PA) may limit some physiological effects of sedentary lifestyle and increase life expectancy. An observational was conducted to measure the HRQoL among older adults living in the community, by comparing a convenience sample of elderly females practicing a structured program of PA from 2 to 3 times per week in 60-min sessions (i.e., active females, AFs) to a sample of participants adopting lifestyle behaviors expending little energy (i.e., sedentary females, SFs). A validated questionnaire (the RAND 36-item) was used as outcome measure. All participants were assessed in terms of cognitive status (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA) to exclude mild cognitive impairment, divided attention/executive functioning (Trail Making Test, Stroop Test) and psychopathological dimensions of anxiety (Geriatric Anxiety Inventory, GAI), and depression (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS). Non-parametric analysis revealed that AFs and SFs differed significantly in the RAND Energy/Fatigue (E/F), Emotional Wellbeing (EW), and Social Functioning (SoF), that was however influenced by education level. Moreover, E/F and EW were negatively associated to anxiety and depression, while SoF was influenced by divided attention. PA results in a healthful behavior for combating feelings of fatigue and low energy as well as emotional distress that can affect health status perception in older women.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Assessment of depressive symptoms in older adults is challenging especially in the presence of risks in cognitive impairment. We aimed to examine whether the convergence between two measures of depressive symptoms (self-report and observer ratings) is affected by varying levels of cognitive function in older adults. METHODS: Self-reported scale of depression, informant-based rating of affective symptoms, and global cognitive function were assessed in 2533 older adults with no impairment, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. The strength of rank-order correlation between the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and behavioral ratings of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was examined as the metric of convergent validity. RESULTS: The results showed that the strength of convergence between the two measurements gradually decreased as a function of lowered cognitive function. Overall tendency showed that diagnoses of cognitive impairment and lower levels of cognitive function were associated with lower correspondence between the two depression measurements. The loss of convergent validity is especially evident in the behavioral symptom of apathy. CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing self-report scales of depression in older adults requires a cautious approach even with minimal or mild levels of cognitive impairment.

T1  - Poststroke apathy: Major role of cognitive, depressive and neurological disorders over imaging determinants
LA  - eng

ET  - 2023/01/18
AB  - Apathy occurs in approximately one third of people after stroke. Despite its frequency and functional consequences, the determinants of apathy have only been partially defined. The major difficulty lies in disentangling the reduction in activity due to apathy itself from those secondary to comorbidities, such as depression, sensorimotor deficits, and cognitive impairment. Here, we aimed to examine the prevalence of apathy, identify confounding sources of hypoactivity, and define its neuroimaging determinants using multivariate voxel lesion symptom-mapping (mVLSM) analyses. We assessed apathy in a subgroup (n = 325, mean age: 63.8 ± 10.5 years, 91.1% ischemic stroke) of the GRECogVASC cohort using the validated Behavioral Dysexecutive Syndrome Inventory, interpreted using GREFEX criteria, as well as confounding factors (depression, anxiety, severity of the neurological deficit, and gait disorders). mVLSM analysis was used to define neuroimaging determinants and was repeated after controlling for confounding factors. Apathy was present for 120 patients (36.9%, 95% CI: 31.7-42.2). Stepwise linear regression identified three factors associated with apathy: depressive symptoms (R(2) = .3, p = .0001), cognitive impairment (R(2) = .015, p = .02), and neurological deficit (R(2) = .110, p = .0001). Accordingly, only 9 (7.5%) patients had apathy without a confounding factor, i.e., isolated apathy. In conventional VLSM analysis, apathy was associated with a large number of subcortical lesions that were no longer considered after controlling for confounding factors. Strategic site analysis identified five regions associated with isolated apathy: the F3 orbitalis pars, left amygdala, left thalamus, left pallidum, and mesencephalon. mVLSM analysis identified four strategic sites associated with apathy: the right corticospinal tract (R(2) = .11; p = .0001), left frontostriatal tract (R(2) = .11; p = .0001), left thalamus (R(2) = .04; p = .0001), and left amygdala (R(2) = .01; p = .013). These regions remained significant after controlling for confounding factors but explained a lower amount of variance. These findings indicate that poststroke apathy is more strongly associated with depression, neurological deficit, and cognitive impairment than with stroke lesions locations, at least using VLSM analysis.

T1  - Unpacking the NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery in Persons With Parkinson's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-5843
SN  - 0887-6177
Y1  - 2023/02/18
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Examine the relationship between the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Emotion Battery (Emotion Toolbox) and traditional measures in Parkinson's disease (PD). METHOD: Persons with PD (n = 30) and cognitively healthy older adults (OA; n = 40) completed the Emotion Toolbox consisting of Well-Being, Negative Affect, and Social Satisfaction scores along with traditional measures of depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II]), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI]), and apathy (Apathy Scale [AS]); total raw scores). RESULTS: Separate bootstrapped analyses of covariance indicated that the PD group scored higher on BDI-II and STAI-State compared to OA (ps < .01); groups did not differ on Emotion Toolbox. In the PD group, bootstrapped partial correlations indicated that Negative Affect was positively related to BDI-II and STAI (ps ≤ .001). Social Satisfaction was negatively related to BDI-II and STAI-Trait (.05 < ps < .004). Psychological Well-Being was negatively related to BDI-II, AS, and STAI (p < .004). No relationships emerged in OA. In the PD group, separate binary logistic regressions showed that traditional measures (BDI-II, AS, and STAI-Trait) correctly classified 79.6% those with formal psychiatric diagnoses (presence vs. absence; p < .011), whereas Emotion Toolbox measures correctly classified 73.3% (p < .019). CONCLUSIONS: The Emotion Toolbox showed moderate-strong correlations with traditional measures in persons with PD. Even so, it did not capture the group differences between PD and OA and had a somewhat lower classification accuracy rate for persons with PD who had a formal psychiatric diagnosis than traditional measures. Together, findings question the utility of the Emotion Toolbox as a stand-alone emotion screener in PD.

T1  - Fatigue-related symptom clusters and functional status of older adults in hospice
LA  - eng
SN  - 1478-9523
SN  - 1478-9515
Y1  - 2023/02/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is frequently co-existing with other symptoms and is highly prevalent among patients with cancer and geriatric population. There was a lack of knowledge that focus on fatigue clusters in older adults with cancer in hospice care. OBJECTIVES: To identify fatigue-related symptom clusters in older adult hospice patients and discover to what extent fatigue-related symptom clusters predict functional status while controlling for depression. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study in a sample of 519 older adult hospice patients with cancer, who completed the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression, Boston Short Form Scale, and the Palliative Performance Scale. Data from a multi-center symptom trial were extracted for this secondary analysis using exploratory factor analysis and hierarchical multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Data from 519 patients (78 ± 7 years) with terminal cancer who received hospice care under home healthcare services revealed that 39% of the participants experienced fatigue-related symptom clusters (lack of energy, feeling drowsy, and lack of appetite). The fatigue cluster was significantly associated positively with depression (r = 0.253, p < 0.01), and negatively with functional status (r = -0.117, p < 0.01) and was a strong predictor of participants' low functional status. Furthermore, depression made a significant contribution to this predictive relationship. CONCLUSION: Older adult hospice patients with cancer experienced various concurrent symptoms. The fatigue-specific symptom cluster was identified significantly associated with depression and predicted functional status. Fatigue should be routinely monitored in older adults, especially among hospice cancer patients, to help reduce psychological distress and prevent functional decline.

T1  - Measuring and Understanding the Health Impact of Greater Fatigability in Older Adults: A Call to Action and Opportunities
LA  - eng
SN  - 2164-1846
SN  - 2164-1862
Y1  - 2023
ET  - 2023/09/04
AB  - Different from fatigue, an instantaneous state of tiredness, weakness and lack of energy, fatigability is a trait that contextualizes whole-body fatigue to the level of activity (i.e., intensity and duration) with which the fatigue is associated. Fatigability can be perceived or performance-related. Measuring fatigability improves upon traditional fatigue measures by accounting for self-pacing as older adults likely slow down or limit their daily activity to maintain fatigue in a tolerable range. Anchoring fatigue to activities/tasks improves sensitivity and allows for meaningful comparisons across individuals/between studies, as well as evaluating change over time and treatment effects. Two well-validated approaches are utilized to measure perceived fatigability: 1) a 5-minute slow-paced (1.5 mph/0.67 m/s, 0% grade) treadmill walk immediately followed by Borg rating of perceived exertion; and 2) a self-administered 10-item questionnaire, Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale, with both physical and mental subscales. Many walking-based performance fatigability measures are based on certain lap time or distance, while the Pittsburgh Performance Fatigability Index uses raw accelerometry data to quantify percent of cadence decline over the entire long distance walking tasks. Perceived fatigability prevalence ranges from 20-90% in older adults varying by assessment tool, and is higher with advancing age and in women compared to men. Fatigability is associated with physical and cognitive function, fall risk, mobility decline, and mortality. Unfortunately, the available research lacks representativeness in terms of racial and ethnic diversity. The time is now to incorporate our established sensitive and validated fatigability measures into global research and clinical practice to better understand mechanistic underpinnings and reveal intervention effects to reduce the burden and lessen the consequences of greater fatigability worldwide.

T1  - Distinguishing apathy and depression in older adults with mild cognitive impairment using text, audio, and video based on multiclass classification and shapely additive explanations
LA  - eng
SN  - 1099-1166
Y1  - 2022/11/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a classification model to detect and distinguish apathy and depression based on text, audio, and video features and to make use of the shapely additive explanations (SHAP) toolkit to increase the model interpretability. METHODS: Subjective scales and objective experiments were conducted on 319 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients to measure apathy and depression. The MCI patients were classified into four groups, depression only, apathy only, depressed-apathetic, and the normal group. Speech, facial and text features were extracted using the open-source data analysis toolkits. Multiclass classification and SHAP toolkits were used to develop a classification model and explain the contribution of specific features. RESULTS: The macro-averaged f1 score and accuracy for overall model were 0.91 and 0.90, respectively. The accuracy for the apathetic, depressed, depressed-apathetic, and normal groups were 0.98, 0.88, 0.93, and 0.82, respectively. The SHAP toolkit identified speech features (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) 4, spectral slopes, F0, F1), facial features (action unit (AU) 14, 26, 28, 45), and text feature (text 6 semantic) associated with apathy. Meanwhile, speech features (spectral slopes, shimmer, F0) and facial expression (AU 2, 6, 7, 10, 14, 26, 45) were associated with depression. Apart from the shared features mentioned above, new speech (MFCC 2, loudness) and facial (AU 9) features were observed in the depressive-apathetic group. CONCLUSIONS: Apathy and depression shared some verbal and facial features while also exhibited distinct features. A combination of text, audio, and video could be used to improve the early detection and differential diagnosis of apathy and depression in MCI patients.

T1  - Psychometric properties of the EURO-D scale of depressive symptomatology: Evidence from SHARE wave 8
LA  - eng
SN  - 1573-2517
Y1  - 2022/09/15
ET  - 2022/06/27
AB  - BACKGROUND: The EURO-D is a short scale to measure symptoms of depression, very used in large population surveys. Although there are numerous validation studies, its psychometric properties remain unclear. The two-factor structure (Affective Suffering and Lack of Motivation) is replicated in several studies but with different item compositions, and none reported reliability indices for both factors. For that reason, the aim of this study is to examine the factorial validity of the scale, the reliability of the dimensions, the gender differential item functioning (DIF), and the nomological validity. METHODS: 46,317 participants aged 50 and over (M = 71.33), from which 57.4 % were females, in Wave 8 of the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) were included. INSTRUMENTS: EURO-D, R-UCLA, Self-perceived health index, and indicator of taking drugs for anxiety or depression. Factor Analyses, DIF, Reliability Index and Spearman correlations were estimated. RESULTS: Factor analysis identified a bifactor structure: a general factor of Depression and two specific factors of Affective Suffering and Lack of Motivation, which reliabilities were 0.83, 0.83 and 0.79 respectively. No relevant DIF item by gender was found, but higher scores were found in women in all factors. Both factors had positive relations with loneliness, taking drugs and self-perceived health. LIMITATIONS: this study has a cross-sectional design; future research may consider the longitudinal stability of the scale. CONCLUSIONS: EURO-D shows adequate psychometric properties when a general factor of depression and two specific factors are considered. Women have higher scores on all dimensions.

T1  - Implementing Affordable Socially Assistive Pet Robots in Care Homes Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Stratified Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial and Mixed Methods Study
LA  - eng
SN  - 2561-7605
Y1  - 2022/08/24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Robot pets may assist in the challenges of supporting an aging population with growing dementia prevalence. Prior work has focused on the impacts of the robot seal Paro on older adult well-being, but recent studies have suggested the good acceptability and implementation feasibility of more affordable devices (Joy for All [JfA] cats and dogs). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to address the limited effectiveness research on JfA devices. METHODS: We conducted an 8-month, stratified, cluster randomized controlled trial in 8 care homes in Cornwall, United Kingdom. Over 4 months, 4 care homes each received 2 JfA devices (1 cat and 1 dog; intervention group), and 4 homes received care as usual (control group). Psychometrics were collected before and after the intervention to compare the change from baseline to follow-up between the groups. In the final 4 months, all 8 care homes received devices, but only qualitative data were collected owing to COVID-19 and reduced capacity. The primary outcome was neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory [NPI] Nursing Home version). Care provider burden was a secondary outcome (occupational disruptiveness NPI subscale), alongside the Challenging Behavior scale, the Holden communication scale, the Campaign to End Loneliness questionnaire, and medication use. Qualitative data were collected through care staff observation calendars and end-of-study interviews to understand use, experience, and impact. We also collected demographic data and assessed dementia severity. In total, 253 residents had robot interaction opportunities, and 83 were consented for direct data collection. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the total change from baseline to follow-up between the intervention and control groups for NPI (P<.001) and occupational disruptiveness (P=.03). Neuropsychiatric symptoms increased in the control group and decreased in the intervention group. No significant difference was seen for communication issues or challenging behavior. For NPI subdomains, there were significant differences from baseline to follow-up in delusions (P=.03), depression (P=.01), anxiety (P=.001), elation (P=.02), and apathy (P=.009), all of which decreased in the intervention group and increased slightly in the control group. The summative impact results suggested that most residents (46/54, 85%) who interacted with robots experienced a positive impact. Those who interacted had significantly higher dementia severity scores (P=.001). The qualitative results suggested good adoption, acceptability, and suitability for subjectively lonely individuals and lack of a novelty effect through sustained use, and demonstrated that the reasons for use were entertainment, anxiety, and agitation. CONCLUSIONS: Affordable robot pets hold potential for improving the well-being of care home residents and people with dementia, including reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms and occupational disruptiveness. This work suggests no novelty effect and contributes toward understanding robot pet suitability. Moreover, interactions were more common among residents with more moderate/severe dementia and those subjectively lonely.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Examine the association between personality measures and perceived mental fatigability. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis in N=1670 men, age 84.3±4.1 years. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the covariate adjusted association between personality measures (conscientiousness, optimism, goal reengagement, and goal disengagement) and perceived mental fatigability (measured with the validated 10-item Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale, PFS). RESULTS: One standard deviation lower conscientiousness (β=-0.91, p<.0001) and optimism (β=-0.63, p<.0001), and higher goal reengagement (β=0.51, p=.01) scores were independently associated with higher PFS Mental scores adjusted for age, cognitive function, self-reported health status, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance, physical activity, and goal disengagement. DISCUSSION: Lower conscientiousness, optimism, and higher goal reengagement were linked with more severe perceived mental fatigability in older men. Personality traits may potentially contribute to early risk assessment for fatigability in later life. Future work should be longitudinal in nature and include personality assessments to confirm the temporality of the relationships observed.

AB  - Depression is a common mental health illness worldwide that affects our quality of life and ability to work. Although prior research has used EEG signals to increase the accuracy to identify depression, the rates of underdiagnosis remain high, and novel methods are required to identify depression. In this study, we built a model based on single-channel, dry-electrode EEG sensor technology to detect state depression, which measures the intensity of depressive feelings and cognitions at a particular time. To test the accuracy of our model, we compared the results of our model with other commonly used methods for depression diagnosis, including the PHQ-9, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and House-Tree-Person (HTP) drawing test, in three different studies. In study 1, we compared the results of our model with PHQ-9 in a sample of 158 senior high students. The results showed that the consistency rate of the two methods was 61.4%. In study 2, the results of our model were compared with HAM-D among 71 adults. We found that the consistency rate of state-depression identification by the two methods was 63.38% when a HAM-D score above 7 was considered depression, while the consistency rate increased to 83.10% when subjects showed at least one depressive symptom (including depressed mood, guilt, suicide, lack of interest, retardation). In study 3, 68 adults participated in the study, and the results revealed that the consistency rate of our model and HTP drawing test was 91.2%. The results showed that our model is an effective means to identify state depression. Our study demonstrates that using our model, people with state depression could be identified in a timely manner and receive interventions or treatments, which may be helpful for the early detection of depression.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mental health in Kashmir remains a concern and is threatening to become an ever-increasing epidemic. The changing social structure and the low-intensity armed conflict have become the basis of a deteriorating state of mental health among Kashmiris. In addition to this, the other factors are widespread poverty, uncertainty, grief, oppression, fear and high unemployment with limited employment generating sectors. AIM: To assess the depression, anxiety and mental distress among the adult population of Budgam district, Kashmir, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the community level in District Budgam, Jammu and Kashmir, India, from December 2019 to March 2020. Total three Investigators, one Senior Research Fellow (SRF) and two Junior Research Fellow (JRF) collected the data. The SRF was a Clinical Psychologist while the JRF were trained social workers. A door to door survey was conducted in the villages which were selected randomly from the list of the villages. The probability random sampling technique was used for the research purpose. Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) was used in the study and whereby after analysing the scores of the scale, results were derived. Chi-square and t-test were applied for statistical comparison. RESULTS: Out of 133 individuals, 55 were males and 78 were females.The age of the sample ranged from 18 to 45 years, with a mean age of 37 years. Total 29.32% of the adults scored above the cut-off for anxiety symptoms and 34.58% scored above the cut-off for depressive symptoms, while 39% of these adults fall above the cut-off for mental distress scores.The validated cut-off score for the anxiety was 1.75 and for the depression was 1.57. Feeling tense, being worried, nervousness and low energy were reported as the symptoms of the mental distress among the people. Females, unemployed and individuals from lower socio-economic status reported higher degree of mental distress than others. CONCLUSION: Mental health issues in terms of anxiety, depression, and mental distress are found among the adult population in district Budgam. There was a significant mean difference in the mental distress levels concerning various socio-demographic variables. The study concluded that being female, having some medical condition, being unemployed, belonging to lower socio-economic status, belonging to nuclear family predict mental health distress.

T1  - A novel approach to investigate depression symptoms in the aging population using generalizability theory

AB  - As depression is common in older people and confers significant risk for dementia, its accurate assessment is essential. The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) is a widely used assessment tool for measuring depression in aged populations, and its psychometric properties have been recently improved using Rasch analysis. However, its temporal reliability and ability to distinguish between dynamic and enduring symptoms of depression have not been examined using the appropriate methodology. Generalizability theory (G theory) is a suitable method to distinguish between enduring and dynamic symptoms of depression and to evaluate the reliability of the GDS-15 scores and sources of measurement error. We applied G theory to the longitudinal GDS-15 data of 354 participants from the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study, collected biennially over 10 years, from individuals aged 70 years and older. The GDS-15 demonstrated strong reliability and generalizability of its test scores in measuring enduring symptoms of depression (G(a) = 0.82, G(r) = 0.90) across the sample population and occasions, and indicated that depression scores significantly increased over time. In addition, three identified dynamic symptoms of depression, namely helplessness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities, did not affect the overall reliability of the GDS-15. Thus, the GDS-15 is a reliable measure for assessing enduring symptoms of depression and can be used to evaluate the efficacy of depression treatments and monitor depression levels over time in older adults.

T1  - Validation of the Sinhalese Version of Brief COPE Scale for patients with cancer in Sri Lanka
LA  - eng
SN  - 2050-7283
Y1  - 2022/06/20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coping strategies play a vital role in cancer management and has been an integral part in the recovery process of cancer patients worldwide. Coping refers to specific efforts; both behavioral and psychological, that diminishes stresses emerged in cancer patients. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Sinhalese version of the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory (S-BC) which was developed based on the Brief COPE scale  for cancer patients in Sri Lanka. METHODS: The original Brief COPE is a self-administered tool with 28 items designed to measure coping methods used by people in stressful life events. It consisted of statements related to adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies. Forty patients with cancer who were registered at the Oncology ward, Teaching Hospital, Galle, Sri Lanka were included in the study. A cross-cultural adaptation of the Brief COPE was done using WHO guidelines. Reliability of the S-BC was assessed using test-retest and internal consistency procedures. The construct validity of the tool was assessed by performing exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Convergent and discriminant validity of the S-BC was tested using World Health Organization-Quality of Life-Brief scale (WHOQOL-BREF) and Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D). RESULTS: The mean (± SD) age of the sample was 61(± 12) years, and 52.5% (n = 21) of the participants were men. Eighty percent (n = 32) of the participants were more than one year of treatment from diagnosing as a cancer patient. The test-retest reliability of the S-BC was 0.66, and the internal consistency of the S-BC was good (Cronbach's alpha - 0.819). Both EFA and CFA revealed a structure comprised of seven factors. Such factors were Avoidance/Behavioral disengagement, Religious faith/Acceptance, Seeking support, Planning, Substance use/Venting, Self-blame and Active/positive coping. The scores of the adaptive coping of the S-BC was negatively and the scores of the maladaptive coping of the S-BC was positively correlated with the CES-D score.   The scores of the adaptive coping of the S-BC was  positively correlated with the total score of the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire indicating the S-BC's convergent and discriminant validity properties. CONCLUSION: The Sinhalese version of the Brief COPE is found to be a valid and a reliable measure to assess coping strategies used by  patients with cancer in Sri Lanka.

T1  - Awareness of age-related change, future time perspective, and implications for goal adjustment in older adulthood
LA  - eng
SN  - 1364-6915
Y1  - 2022/06/
ET  - 2021/03/06
AB  - OBJECTIVES: How people adjust their goals is central to adaptation across the lifespan. However, little is known about individual difference characteristics that predict how and why people use different self-regulatory strategies. The present study investigated associations of perceived age-related gains and losses, and their interaction, as predictors of goal adjustment in older adulthood. Furthermore, we examined whether future time perspective (FTP) mediated relationships between awareness of age-related change (AARC) and goal adjustment. METHOD: A community-based sample of 408 adults (aged 60-88 years) was recruited via an internet-based research platform. Participants completed questionnaire measures of AARC, FTP, goal disengagement, and goal re-engagement. A flexibility index reflecting tendencies toward use of both goal disengagement and goal re-engagement strategies was also analyzed. RESULTS: Although AARC-losses was associated with lower goal re-engagement and goal flexibility, this association was weaker among those with higher AARC-gains, indicating AARC-gains may be protective in the relationship between AARC-losses and goal adjustment. The association between AARC and goal adjustment was also shown to be mediated by FTP. Higher AARC-gains was associated with more expansive FTP, which was associated with lower goal disengagement and higher goal re-engagement. On the other hand, higher AARC-losses was associated with more restricted FTP, which was associated with higher goal disengagement and lower goal re-engagement. DISCUSSION: Results have implications for how we conceptualize the combined effects of age-related gains and losses on developmental outcomes relevant to adaptive aging. Furthermore, perceptions of future time with advancing age may be implicated in processes linking AARC with goal adjustment.

AB  - This study examined individual components of the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15) to determine whether the 3-item Withdrawal-Apathy-Lack of Vigor (WAV) subscale, which has been validated in older adults and advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), was applicable to newly diagnosed patients with PD. Baseline Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) data (n = 345), including GDS-15 and Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) depression, apathy, and anxiety scores, were examined. Data reduction techniques (i.e., principal components, confirmatory factor analyses) were used. Model fit was poor for the previously identified GDS-15 factor structures. Via principal components analysis, 5 components were identified, none of which reflected the 3-item WAV subscale previously reported in the literature. Internal consistency of the GDS-15 was acceptable, as was the internal consistency for the largest component (labeled "Dysphoria"). All 5 components significantly correlated with the MDS-UPDRS depression, apathy, and anxiety items. Model fit was fair for the "Dysphoria" factor only. Overall, the 3-item WAV factor reported in previous literature was not supported in this sample of de novo PD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hopelessness is characterized by a set of negative cognitive schemas about the future, conceptualized on the basis of three dimensions: affective, motivational and cognitive. This construct is linked to loneliness, the incidence of which in older adults is increasingly high. The aim of this research is to test whether hopelessness factors predict levels of loneliness in older adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 138 non-institutionalized persons from Valencia city between 65-90 years old participated, with a mean age of 73.67 (SD=4.8), and 59.4% were women. The Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale (UCLA) were administered to assess participants. RESULTS: The motivational and cognitive factors acted as statistically significant predictors of loneliness, while the affective factor was not presented as a significant factor. The final model obtained an R(2)adj=.442, F(3, 87)=23.97, p<.001. CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness is a phenomenon of great concern in the field of gerontology due to its high incidence and impact. The results indicate that hopelessness, specifically loss of motivation and negative expectations about the future, are critical issues for the development of feelings of loneliness in older adults. Thus, it is relevant to pay attention to these variables in order to apply loneliness prevention programs.

AB  - Late-life depression (LLD) increases risk for dementia and brain pathology, but possibly this is only true for one or more symptom profiles of LLD. In 4354 participants (76 ± 5 years; 58% female) from the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES)-Reykjavik Study, we identified five LLD symptom profiles, based on the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (no LLD (57%); apathy (31%); apathy with emptiness (2%), mild LLD (8%) and severe LLD (2%)). Cox regression analyses showed that severe LLD, mild LLD and apathy increased risk of dementia up to 12 years, compared to no LLD. Additionally, hippocampal volume loss and white matter lesion increase, were assessed on 1.5 T MR images, at baseline and after 5 years follow-up. Only severe LLD showed increased WML volume over time, but not on hippocampal volume loss. WML increase over time mediated partially the relation between mild LLD and dementia but not for the other symptom profiles. It appears that hippocampal atrophy and LLD are independent predictors for dementia incidence, whereas for mild LLD the risk for dementia is partially mediated by WML changes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Feeling depressed and lethargic are common side effects of prostate cancer (PCa) and its treatments. We examined the incidence and severity of feeling depressed and lack of energy in patients in a population based PCa registry. METHODS: We included men diagnosed with PCa between 2015 and 2019 in Victoria, Australia, and enrolled in the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry. The primary outcome measures were responses to two questions on the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) patient reported instrument: problems with feeling depressed and problems with lack of energy 12 months following treatment. We evaluated associations between these and age, cancer risk category, treatment type, and urinary, bowel, and sexual function. RESULTS: Both outcome questions were answered by 9712 out of 12,628 (77%) men. 981 patients (10%) reported at least moderate problems with feeling depressed; 1563 (16%) had at least moderate problems with lack of energy and 586 (6.0%) with both. Younger men reported feeling depressed more frequently than older men. Lack of energy was more common for treatments that included androgen deprivation therapy than not (moderate/big problems: 31% vs. 13%), irrespective of disease risk category. Both outcomes were associated with poorer urinary, bowel, and sexual functional domain scores. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported depressive feelings and lack of energy were frequent in this population-based registry. Problems with feeling depressed were more common in younger men and lack of energy more common in men having hormonal treatment. Clinicians should be aware of the incidence of these symptoms in these at-risk groups and be able to screen for them.

T1  - Sarcopenia and motoric cognitive risk syndrome: a moderated mediation model
LA  - eng
SN  - 1471-2318
Y1  - 2022/02/19
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia has been identified as a risk factor for cognitive impairment, and motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a recently defined pre-dementia syndrome. It is not known whether they are related. We aimed to investigate the association and potential pathways between sarcopenia and MCR in the community elderly by establishing a moderated mediation model. METHODS: 846 community residents aged ≥ 60 years were recruited from May 2021 to September 2021 and had a comprehensive geriatric evaluation. The diagnosis of sarcopenia followed the criteria issued by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia in 2019. MCR was defined as subjective cognitive decline and slow gait. Apathy symptoms and physical activity were assessed by the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Logistic regression and moderated mediation analyses were conducted to explore the association between the four. RESULTS: 60 (7.1%) had MCR among 846 participants. After full adjustment, sarcopenia (odds ratio [OR] = 3.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.69-8.60, P = 0.001), AES score (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.04-1.14, P < 0.001), and IPAQ level (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.28-0.66, P < 0.001) were associated with MCR. Apathy partially mediated the relationship between sarcopenia and MCR. Physical activity played a moderation role in the indirect pathway of the mediation model. The increase in physical activity can alleviate the indirect effect of sarcopenia on MCR. CONCLUSION: We established a moderated mediation model to uncover the underlying association mechanism of sarcopenia and MCR preliminarily. These findings suggest that attention should be paid to the management of apathy and physical activity in the context of sarcopenia to prevent early dementia actively. Further validation is needed in future longitudinal studies.

AB  - The prevalence of late-life depression (LLD) depends on the study sample, measurements, and diagnostic approaches. We estimated the 30 item-Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-30) accuracy against the gold standard LLD diagnosis made with the Semi-structured Clinical Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders, focusing on the prevalence of a late-life major depressive disorder (MDD), in a population-based sample of 843 subjects aged>65 years, subdivided into three groups: normal cognition, subjective memory complaints, and mild cognitive impairment. At the optimal cut-off score (≥4), the GDS-30 showed 65.1% sensitivity and 68.4% specificity for LLD (63% and 66% for late-life MDD, respectively). Using the standard cut-off score (≥10), the GDS-30 specificity reached 91.2%, while sensitivity dropped to 37.7%, indicating a lower screening accuracy [area under the curve(AUC):0.728, 95% confidence interval(CI):0.67-0-78]. The GDS-30 performance was associated with educational level, but not with age, gender, cognition, apathy, and somatic/psychiatric multimorbidity. For subjective memory complaints subjects, at the optimal cut-off score (≥7), the GDS-30 showed better discrimination performances (AUC=0.792,95%CI:0.60-0.98), but again the educational level affected the diagnostic performance. In subjective memory complaints subjects, symptom-based scales like the GDS-30 may feature a better performance for diagnosing depression in older age, but the GDS-30 seems to require adjustment to the patient's educational level.

T1  - Lasting Symptoms After Esophageal Resection (LASER): European Multicenter Cross-sectional Study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1528-1140
Y1  - 2022/02/01
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the most prevalent symptoms and those with greatest impact upon health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among esophageal cancer survivors. BACKGROUND: Long-term symptom burden after esophagectomy, and associations with HRQOL, are poorly understood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2010 and 2016, patients from 20 European Centers who underwent esophageal cancer surgery, and were disease-free at least 1 year postoperatively were asked to complete LASER, EORTC-QLQ-C30, and QLQ-OG25 questionnaires. Specific symptom questionnaire items that were associated with poor HRQOL as identified by EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OG25 were identified by multivariable regression analysis and combined to form a tool. RESULTS: A total of 876 of 1081 invited patients responded to the questionnaire, giving a response rate of 81%. Of these, 66.9% stated in the last 6 months they had symptoms associated with their esophagectomy. Ongoing weight loss was reported by 10.4% of patients, and only 13.8% returned to work with the same activities.Three LASER symptoms were correlated with poor HRQOL on multivariable analysis; pain on scars on chest (odds ratio (OR) 1.27; 95% CI 0.97-1.65), low mood (OR 1.42; 95% CI 1.15-1.77) and reduced energy or activity tolerance (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.18-1.59). The areas under the curves for the development and validation datasets were 0.81 ± 0.02 and 0.82 ± 0.09 respectively. CONCLUSION: Two-thirds of patients experience significant symptoms more than 1 year after surgery. The 3 key symptoms associated with poor HRQOL identified in this study should be further validated, and could be used in clinical practice to identify patients who require increased support.

T1  - Measuring neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with early cognitive decline using speech analysis
LA  - eng
SN  - 1778-3585
SN  - 0924-9338
Y1  - 2021/10/13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Certain neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), namely apathy, depression, and anxiety demonstrated great value in predicting dementia progression, representing eventually an opportunity window for timely diagnosis and treatment. However, sensitive and objective markers of these symptoms are still missing. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the association between automatically extracted speech features and NPS in patients with mild neurocognitive disorders. METHODS: Speech of 141 patients aged 65 or older with neurocognitive disorder was recorded while performing two short narrative speech tasks. NPS were assessed by the neuropsychiatric inventory. Paralinguistic markers relating to prosodic, formant, source, and temporal qualities of speech were automatically extracted, correlated with NPS. Machine learning experiments were carried out to validate the diagnostic power of extracted markers. RESULTS: Different speech variables are associated with specific NPS; apathy correlates with temporal aspects, and anxiety with voice quality-and this was mostly consistent between male and female after correction for cognitive impairment. Machine learning regressors are able to extract information from speech features and perform above baseline in predicting anxiety, apathy, and depression scores. CONCLUSIONS: Different NPS seem to be characterized by distinct speech features, which are easily extractable automatically from short vocal tasks. These findings support the use of speech analysis for detecting subtypes of NPS in patients with cognitive impairment. This could have great implications for the design of future clinical trials as this cost-effective method could allow more continuous and even remote monitoring of symptoms.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Research Center program added the Lewy body dementia module (LBD-MOD) to the Uniform Data Set to facilitate LBD characterization and distinguish dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer's disease (AD). We tested the performance of the LBD-MOD. METHODS: The LBD-MOD was completed in a single-site study in 342 participants: 53 controls, 78 AD, and 110 DLB; 79 mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-AD); and 22 MCI-DLB. RESULTS: DLB differed from AD in extrapyramidal symptoms, hallucinations, apathy, autonomic features, REM sleep behaviors, daytime sleepiness, cognitive fluctuations, timed attention tasks, and visual perception. MCI-DLB differed from MCI-AD in extrapyramidal features, mood, autonomic features, fluctuations, timed attention tasks, and visual perception. Descriptive data on LBD-MOD measures are provided for reference. DISCUSSION: The LBD-MOD provided excellent characterization of core and supportive features to differentiate DLB from AD and healthy controls while also characterizing features of MCI-DLB.

T1  - The Effect of Reminiscence Therapy Using Virtual Reality on Apathy in Residential Aged Care: Multisite Nonrandomized Controlled Trial
LA  - eng
SN  - 1438-8871
SN  - 1439-4456
Y1  - 2021/09/20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a frequent and underrecognized neurological disorder symptom. Reduced goal-directed behavior caused by apathy is associated with poor outcomes for older adults in residential aged care. Recommended nonpharmacological treatments include person-centered therapy using information and communication technology. Virtual reality (VR) in the form of head-mounted displays (HMDs) is a fully immersive technology that provides access to a wide range of freely available content. The use of VR as a therapy tool has demonstrated promise in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety. In addition, VR has been used to improve conditions including depression, anxiety, cognitive function, and balance in older adults with memory deficits, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease. Research using VR for the symptoms of apathy in older adults living in residential aged care facilities is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine whether using HMDs as a tool for reminiscence therapy improves the symptoms of apathy compared with using a laptop computer and physical items with older adults living in residential aged care. METHODS: In this multisite trial, 43 participants were allocated to one of three groups: reminiscence therapy intervention using VR in the form of HMDs, reminiscence therapy using a laptop computer supplemented by physical items if required (active control), and a usual care (passive control) group. The primary outcome was apathy, and the secondary outcomes included cognition and depression. The side effects of using HMDs were also measured in the VR group. RESULTS: Mixed model analyses revealed no significant group interaction over time in outcomes between the VR and laptop groups (estimate=-2.24, SE 1.89; t(40)=-1.18; P=.24). Pooled apathy scores in the two intervention groups compared with the passive control group also revealed no significant group interaction over time (estimate=-0.26, SE 1.66; t(40)=-0.16; P=.88). There were no significant secondary outcomes. Most participants in the VR group stated that they would prefer to watch content in VR than on a flat screen (Χ(2)(2)=11.2; P=.004), side effects from HMD use were negligible to minimal according to the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire cutoff scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although there were no significant results in outcome measures, this study found that participants engaged in the research and enjoyed the process of reminiscing using both forms of technology. It was found that VR can be implemented in an aged care setting with correct protocols in place. Providing residents in aged care with a choice of technology may assist in increasing participation in activities. We cannot dismiss the importance of immediate effects while the therapy was in progress, and this is an avenue for future research.

ET  - 2021/03/16
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the Neurological Fatigue Index-Stroke (C-NFI-Stroke) in stroke survivors. DESIGN: This was a validation study. Cross-cultural adaptation of the scale was conducted according to standard guidelines. Reliability, validity, responsiveness, and interpretability were measured. SETTING: Self-help groups and a community center. SUBJECTS: One hundred and twelve Chinese stroke survivors and 65 healthy Chinese older people living in the community. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN MEASURES: The C-NFI-Stroke, Fatigue Severity Scale, Mental Fatigue Scale, General Self-Efficacy Scale, and Geriatric Depression Scale were used. RESULTS: Cronbach's α coefficients were 0.69-0.88; the item-level agreement was 70.4%-88.9%; the weighted Kappa value was 0.47-0.79; and the intra-class correlation coefficients were 0.88-0.93. The C-NFI-Stroke had no ceiling and floor effects. It had good content validity and had two factors, "lack of energy" and "tiredness/weakness." The confirmatory factor analysis showed a good fit to the model. The C-NFI-Stroke significantly correlated with existing fatigue scales (r(s) = 0.55-0.63), self-efficacy (r(s) = -0.31 to -0.37), and depressive symptoms (r(s) = 0.53-0.60). The C-NFI-Stroke could discern differences between stroke survivors and healthy older people. CONCLUSIONS: The C-NFI-Stroke is a reliable and valid tool for clinical and research use on people who have been diagnosed with stroke for a year or more, although its factor structure differs from that of the original English version.

AB  - In this meta-synthesis study, 47 qualitative studies that were conducted with a total of 2234 female participants aged between 18 and 75 years in 22 different countries were analyzed. The women were found to not participate breast cancer screening behaviors due to personal, social, and system barriers. Women's personal barriers were determined as fear, embarrassment, breast cancer perceptions and beliefs, lack of motivation, lack of knowledge, socioeconomic status, and negative experiences. Culture and stigma were identified as social barriers. Health insurance coverage, accessibility of health care services, and the attitudes of health care workers were classified as system barriers.

T1  - Is Depression or Apathy Playing a Key Role in Predicting Financial Capacity in Parkinson's Disease with Dementia and Frontotemporal Dementia?
LA  - eng
SN  - 2076-3425
SN  - 2076-3425
Y1  - 2021/06/14
AB  - (1) Background: Depression and apathy both affect cognitive abilities, such as thinking, concentration and making decisions in young and old individuals. Although apathy is claimed to be a "core" feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), it may occur in the absence of depression and vice versa. Thus, the aim of this study is to explore whether depression or apathy better predict financial capacity performance in PD and FTD as well as in nondemented participants. (2) Methods: Eighty-eight participants divided into three groups (PD, FTD and non-demented participants) were examined with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Legal Capacity for Property Law Transactions Assessment Scale (LCPLTAS)-Full and short form. The Geriatric Depression Scale informant version (GDS-15) and the Irritability-Apathy Scale (IAS) we completed by caregivers. (3) Results: The results indicated that both PD and FTD patients' general cognitive functioning and financial capacity performance is negatively influenced by apathy and not by depression. (4) Conclusions: Differences in financial capacity performance indicate that apathy should not be disregarded in clinical assessments. Further studies on larger PD and FTD populations are necessary in order to investigate the decisive role of mood factors on financial capacity impairment.

T1  - Clinical impact of antipsychotic and benzodiazepine reduction: findings from a multicomponent psychotropic reduction program within long-term aged care
LA  - eng
SN  - 1741-203X
Y1  - 2021/06/

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationships between dose changes to antipsychotic and/or benzodiazepine medications and resident outcomes, including variations in neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life (QoL), and social withdrawal, within a multicomponent, interdisciplinary antipsychotic and benzodiazepine dose reduction program. DESIGN: Prospective, observational, longitudinal study. INTERVENTION: The Reducing Use of Sedatives (RedUSe) project involved 150 Australian Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) incorporating auditing and benchmarking of prescribing, education, and multidisciplinary sedative reviews. SETTING: A convenience sample of LTCFs (n = 28) involved in RedUSe between January 2015 and March 2016. PARTICIPANTS: Permanent residents (n = 206) of LTCFs involved in RedUSe taking an antipsychotic and/or benzodiazepine daily. Residents were excluded if they had a severe psychiatric condition where antipsychotic therapy should generally be maintained long-term (e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia) or were considered end-stage palliative. MEASUREMENTS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI)), QoL (Assessment of Quality of Life-4D), and social withdrawal (Multidimensional Observation Scale for Elderly Subjects-withdrawal subscale) were measured at baseline and 4 months where nursing staff completed psychometric tests as proxy raters. RESULTS: There was no evidence that psychometric measures were worsened following dose reductions. In fact, dose reduction was associated with small, albeit non-statistically significant, improvements in behavior, particularly less physically non-aggressive behavior with both drug groups (-0.36 points per 10% reduction in antipsychotic dose, -0.17 per 10% reduction in benzodiazepine dose) and verbally agitated behavior with benzodiazepine reduction (-0.16 per 10% dose reduction), as measured with the CMAI. Furthermore, antipsychotic reduction was associated with non-statistically significant improvements in QoL and social withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine dose reduction in LTCFs was not associated with deterioration in neuropsychiatric symptoms, QoL, or social withdrawal. Trends toward improved agitation with antipsychotic and benzodiazepine dose reduction require further evaluation in larger, prospective, controlled studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to understand the relationship between resource gains and losses, coping, and the quality of life during the growth phase of the COVID‑19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Internet-based survey covered 353 individuals who had participated in a psychological support project operated by one of the non-governmental organizations in Lublin, Poland, in the 12 months prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. The questionnaire used in the study contained questions to collect sociodemographic data and psychometric scales to measure resource gains and losses (the Conservation of Resources - Evaluation questionnaire), the quality of life (the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF), and strategies of coping with the pandemic situation (a modified Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced questionnaire). RESULTS: A higher global quality of life occurred with higher gains and minor losses, as well as with coping through planning, positive reframing, emotional support seeking, a reduced substance use tendency, low self-blame, avoidance, and disengagement. Moreover, helplessness-based coping strategies were found to mediate both the relationships between resource gains and the quality of life, and between resource losses and the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Factors that may reduce people's quality of life during the COVID‑19 pandemic are an increase in losses and limited gains, experienced over the 6 months preceding the pandemic, as well as not using active, meaning-oriented, and support-seeking coping strategies, but using avoidance behaviors instead. Coping strategies specific to people experiencing helplessness are a mediating mechanism between losses and limited gains of resources, and the quality of life.

T1  - Is geriatric depression scale a valid instrument to screen depression in Chinese community-dwelling elderly?
LA  - eng
SN  - 1471-2318
Y1  - 2021/05/13
AB  - BACKGROUND: The geriatric depression scale (GDS) is used widely as a screening instrument for depression worldwide. The present study aims to examine the reliability and validity of the GDS with 30 items (GDS-30) in Chinese cognitively normal elderly, and to preliminarily investigate the appropriateness of the GDS-30 among screened mild cognitive impairment (MCI) elderly and among the large-scale community-dwelling Chinese elderly. METHODS: A total of 12,610 Chinese elderly completed GDS-30 in the project of Community-based Cohort Study on Nervous System Diseases. Of these, 5503 individuals with the ability to perform basic daily living activities were randomly sampled to further complete the Montreal Cognitive Assessment to screen for MCI. The cutoff value of screened depression was 11, and the cutoff values of MCI were education-dependent. Internal consistency was used to evaluate the reliability. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to determine the factor structure. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to assess the construct validity in the elderly screened normal cognition, screened MCI, and the whole population, respectively. RESULTS: The Kuder-Richardson coefficient (KR20) was 0.834, 0.821 and 0.840 for the cognitively normal elderly, screened MCI and the whole population, respectively. EFA showed that GDS-30 can be either a four-factor model (named positive mood, dysphoria, worry, and social withdrawal-cognitive impairment) or a two-factor model (named depression and positive mood). The latter was easier to interpret. CFA showed that the two-factor model fitted well in the elderly with normal cognition, with screened MCI, and the whole sample. The factors loaded from 0.900 to 0.588, 0.882 to 0.529, and 0.888 to 0.556 in these three populations respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The GDS-30 has good reliability and validity and can be appropriately applied to screen depression in the large-scale community-dwelling Chinese elderly regardless of the presence of mild cognitive impairment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence, timing, and functional impact of psychiatric, cognitive, and motor abnormalities in Huntington disease (HD) gene carriers, we analyzed retrospective clinical data from individuals with manifest HD. METHODS: Clinical features of patients with HD were analyzed for 6,316 individuals in an observational study of the European Huntington's Disease Network (REGISTRY) from 161 sites across 17 countries. Data came from clinical history and the patient-completed Clinical Characteristics Questionnaire that assessed 8 symptoms: motor, cognitive, apathy, depression, perseverative/obsessive behavior, irritability, violent/aggressive behavior, and psychosis. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze relationships between symptoms and functional outcomes. RESULTS: The initial manifestation of HD is increasingly likely to be motor and less likely to be psychiatric as age at presentation increases and is independent of pathogenic CAG repeat length. The Clinical Characteristics Questionnaire captures data on nonmotor symptom prevalence that correlate specifically with validated clinical measures. Psychiatric and cognitive symptoms are common in HD gene carriers, with earlier onsets associated with longer CAG repeats. Of patients with HD, 42.4% reported at least 1 psychiatric or cognitive symptom before motor symptoms, with depression most common. Each nonmotor symptom was associated with significantly reduced total functional capacity scores. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric and cognitive symptoms are common and functionally debilitating in HD gene carriers. They require recognition and targeting with clinical outcome measures and treatments. However, because it is impossible to distinguish confidently between nonmotor symptoms arising from HD and primary psychiatric disorders, particularly in younger premanifest patients, nonmotor symptoms should not be used to make a clinical diagnosis of HD.

T1  - Influence of mobility restrictions on post-stroke pain
LA  - eng
SN  - 2162-3279
Y1  - 2021/05/
ET  - 2021/03/02
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the role of mobility limitations and vitality, as well as additional factors such as comorbidities, to predict post-stroke pain. MATERIALS & METHODS: This study included cross-sectional data from 214 participants living in varied settings in different parts of Sweden. Participants were asked to complete the Stroke Impact Scale, Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36, and Self-administered Comorbidity Questionnaire to evaluate mobility, vitality, comorbidities, and pain. Descriptive statistics were used for demographic and clinical characteristics. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to predict the pain domain score on Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36. RESULTS: The mean age of all participants in the sample was 66 years (SD 14); 43.4% of the study population were women. After analyses, "standing without losing balance and vitality'' were found to be significant predictors in the model which explained the pain score on Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the results suggest that restrictions in mobility and low vitality have an important role on the occurrence of post-stroke pain. Having post-stroke pain could be due to not able to stand without losing balance and low vitality. Thus, rehabilitation professionals may consider the importance of these factors, especially mobility restrictions, in preventing post-stroke pain.

T1  - Four-Month Clinical Status of a Cohort of Patients After Hospitalization for COVID-19
LA  - eng
SN  - 1538-3598
SN  - 0098-7484
Y1  - 2021/04/20
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Little is known about long-term sequelae of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To describe the consequences at 4 months in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a prospective uncontrolled cohort study, survivors of COVID-19 who had been hospitalized in a university hospital in France between March 1 and May 29, 2020, underwent a telephone assessment 4 months after discharge, between July 15 and September 18, 2020. Patients with relevant symptoms and all patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) were invited for further assessment at an ambulatory care visit. EXPOSURES: Survival of hospitalization for COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Respiratory, cognitive, and functional symptoms were assessed by telephone with the Q3PC cognitive screening questionnaire and a checklist of symptoms. At the ambulatory care visit, patients underwent pulmonary function tests, lung computed tomographic scan, psychometric and cognitive tests (including the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey and 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), and, for patients who had been hospitalized in the ICU or reported ongoing symptoms, echocardiography. RESULTS: Among 834 eligible patients, 478 were evaluated by telephone (mean age, 61 years [SD, 16 years]; 201 men, 277 women). During the telephone interview, 244 patients (51%) declared at least 1 symptom that did not exist before COVID-19: fatigue in 31%, cognitive symptoms in 21%, and new-onset dyspnea in 16%. There was further evaluation in 177 patients (37%), including 97 of 142 former ICU patients. The median 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory score (n = 130) was 4.5 (interquartile range, 3.0-5.0) for reduced motivation and 3.7 (interquartile range, 3.0-4.5) for mental fatigue (possible range, 1 [best] to 5 [worst]). The median 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey score (n = 145) was 25 (interquartile range, 25.0-75.0) for the subscale "role limited owing to physical problems" (possible range, 0 [best] to 100 [worst]). Computed tomographic lung-scan abnormalities were found in 108 of 171 patients (63%), mainly subtle ground-glass opacities. Fibrotic lesions were observed in 33 of 171 patients (19%), involving less than 25% of parenchyma in all but 1 patient. Fibrotic lesions were observed in 19 of 49 survivors (39%) with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Among 94 former ICU patients, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms were observed in 23%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 50% in 8 of 83 ICU patients (10%). New-onset chronic kidney disease was observed in 2 ICU patients. Serology was positive in 172 of 177 outpatients (97%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Four months after hospitalization for COVID-19, a cohort of patients frequently reported symptoms not previously present, and lung-scan abnormalities were common among those who were tested. These findings are limited by the absence of a control group and of pre-COVID assessments in this cohort. Further research is needed to understand longer-term outcomes and whether these findings reflect associations with the disease.

T1  - Predictors of Cognitive Improvement Following Treatment for Late-Life Depression
LA  - eng
SN  - 1552-5708
Y1  - 2021/03/
ET  - 2020/03/25
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment is frequently comorbid with late-life depression (LLD) and often persists despite remission of mood symptoms with antidepressant treatment. Increasing understanding of factors that predict improvement of cognitive symptoms in LLD is useful to inform treatment recommendations. METHODS: We used data from 2 randomized clinical trials of geriatric depression to examine the relationships between sociodemographic factors (resilience, quality of life) and clinical factors (age of depression onset, severity of depression, apathy) with subsequent cognitive outcomes. One hundred sixty-five older adults with major depression who had completed one of 2 clinical trials were included: (1) methylphenidate plus placebo, citalopram plus placebo, and citalopram plus methylphenidate or (2) citalopram combined with Tai Chi or health education. A comprehensive neuropsychiatric battery was administered; 2 measures of cognitive improvement were examined, one defined as an increase in general cognitive performance score of at least 1 standard deviation and the other 0.5 standard deviation pre-post treatment. RESULTS: At posttreatment, 59% of participants had remitted, but less than a third of those who remitted showed cognitive improvement (29%). Cognitive improvement was observed in 18% of nonremitters. Lower baseline depression severity, greater social functioning, and depression onset prior to 60 years of age were significantly associated with cognitive improvement. None of the other measures, including baseline apathy, resilience, and depression remission status, were significantly associated with cognitive improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Lower severity of depression, earlier onset, and greater social functioning may predict improvement in cognitive functioning with treatment for depression in LLD.

T1  - Comparability of social anhedonia across epidemiological dimensions: A multinational study of measurement invariance of the Revised Social Anhedonia Scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 1939-134X
Y1  - 2021/02/
ET  - 2020/10/22
AB  - Social anhedonia, or the loss of motivation in and pleasure from social engagement, is an important feature in understanding the etiology and outcome of various psychopathologies. While the Revised Social Anhedonia Scale (RSAS) represents one of the most commonly used self-report measures of social anhedonia, little is known regarding the construct comparability across populations. We examined measurement invariance of the full and brief RSAS in a diverse, international sample of 14,064 participants across nine epidemiological dimensions, including gender, age, ethnicity, education, community income, continent, migrant status, ethnic density, and urbanicity. Both the full and brief RSAS, as represented by a three-factor structure, achieved metric invariance for all dimensions. The full version showed considerable scalar noninvariance for ethnicity and continent, which was significantly reduced in the brief version. These findings suggest that while the scales measure the same construct across diverse groups, mean comparisons are only appropriate for the brief, and not the full, version. Future research may consider using the brief RSAS to ensure cross-national comparability. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).

T1  - Clinical Phenotypes of Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia by Age at Onset
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-8908
SN  - 1387-2877
Y1  - 2021
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is generally considered a young-onset dementia, although age at onset is highly variable. While several studies indicate clinical differences regarding age at onset, no biomarker validated cohort studies with updated clinical criteria have been performed. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine behavior, cognition, and mortality over the full age spectrum in a cohort of bvFTD patients with neuroimaging, genetic, or histopathological confirmation and exclusion of positive Alzheimer's disease biomarkers or severe cerebrovascular damage. METHODS: In total, 315 patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable or definite bvFTD were included from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort and grouped into quartiles by age-at-diagnosis. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive functioning were assessed with the neuropsychiatric inventory, the geriatric depression scale and a neuropsychological test battery. Data on mortality was obtained from the Dutch municipal register. Associations between age-at-diagnosis and clinical features and mortality risk were examined. RESULTS: Age-at-diagnosis ranged from 26 to 85 years and established quartiles with mean ages of 52±6, 61±2, 66±2, and 74±3 years. In the total sample, 44.4%exceeded an age of 65 years at time of diagnosis. Earlier age-at-diagnosis was associated with more severe behavioral symptoms, while later age-at-diagnosis was associated with more severe memory impairment. Unexpectedly, mortality risk was not associated with age-at-diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In bvFTD, symptom profile is associated with age-at-diagnosis. This should be taken into account with regard to diagnostics, patient management, and trial design. Additionally, based on our sample, the prevalence of late-onset bvFTD is higher than generally thought.

T1  - Apathy Measures in Older Adults and People with Dementia: A Systematic Review of Measurement Properties Using the COSMIN Methodology
LA  - eng
SN  - 1421-9824
Y1  - 2021
ET  - 2021/05/11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is highly prevalent in dementia and is also seen in mild cognitive impairment and the general population. Apathy contributes to failure to undertake daily activities and can lead to health problems or crises. It is therefore important to assess apathy. However, there is currently no gold standard measure of apathy. A comprehensive systematic review of the measurement properties of apathy scales is required. METHODS: A systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42018094390). MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched for studies that aimed to develop or assess the validity or reliability of an apathy scale in participants over 65 years, living in the community. A systematic review was conducted in line with the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments procedure for reviewing patient-reported outcome measures. The studies' risk of bias was assessed, and all relevant measurement properties were assessed for quality. Results were pooled and rated using a modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation procedure. RESULTS: Fifty-seven publications regarding 18 measures and 39 variations met the eligibility criteria. The methodological quality of individual studies ranged from inadequate to very good and measurement properties ranged from insufficient to sufficient. Similarly, the overall evidence for measurement properties ranged from very low to high quality. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) and Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) had sufficient content validity, reliability, construct validity, and where applicable, structural validity and internal consistency. CONCLUSION: Numerous scales are available to assess apathy, with varying psychometric properties. The AES and LARS are recommended for measuring apathy in older adults and people living with dementia. The apathy dimension of the commonly used Neuropsychiatric Inventory should be limited to screening for apathy.

T1  - Improving the Diagnosis of the Frontal Variant of Alzheimer's Disease with the DAPHNE Scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-8908
SN  - 1387-2877
Y1  - 2021
AB  - BACKGROUND: The frontal variant of Alzheimer's disease (fAD) is poorly understood and poorly defined. The diagnosis remains challenging. The main differential diagnosis is the behavioral variant of frontotemporal degeneration (bvFTD). For fAD, there is some dissociation between the clinical frontal presentation and imaging and neuropathological studies, which do not always find a specific involvement of the frontal lobes. DAPHNE is a behavioral scale, which demonstrated excellent performance to distinguish between bvFTD and AD. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the reliability of this new tool to improve the clinical diagnosis of fAD. METHODS: Twenty fAD patients and their caregivers were prospectively included and were compared with 36 bvFTD and 22 AD patients. RESULTS: The three main behavioral disorders in the fAD patients were apathy, loss of empathy, and disinhibition. Three disorders were discriminant because they were less frequent and less severe in the fAD patients than in the bvFTD patients, namely hyperorality, neglect, and perseverations. This specific pattern of behavioral disorders was corroborated by SPECT or 18FDG PET-CT scan that showed that patients with fAD could have a medial frontal hypoperfusion, whereas in bvFTD patients the orbitofrontal cortex was the main involved region, with more diffuse hypoperfusion. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that DAPHNE had good sensitivity and good specificity to discriminate between the three groups and in particular between fAD and bvFTD patients. DAPHNE is a quick tool that could help clinicians in memory clinics not only to differentiate bvFTD from typical AD but also from fAD.

T1  - Functional reserve: The residual variance in instrumental activities of daily living not explained by brain structure, cognition, and demographics
LA  - eng

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cognitive reserve is a concept that explains individual differences in resilience to brain pathology and susceptibility to poor late-life cognitive outcomes. We evaluate the analogous concept of "Functional Reserve," defined as the difference between observed functional abilities and those predicted by brain structure, cognitive performance, and demographics. This study aims to validate the construct of functional reserve by testing its utility in predicting clinical outcomes and exploring its predictors. METHOD: Longitudinal data collected annually for up to 7 years from 1,084 older adults (ndementia = 163; nMCI = 333; nCN = 523) were analyzed. Functional reserve was operationalized as the residual variance in the Lawton-Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale after accounting for demographics (sex/gender, race, ethnicity, education), neuropathology (gray matter, hippocampal, and white matter hyperintensity volumes), and cognition (executive function, verbal episodic memory, semantic memory, and spatial function). Structural equation models estimated (a) functional reserve's associations with 7-year changes in clinical diagnosis and disease severity and (b) predictors of functional reserve. RESULTS: Functional reserve was lower in dementia versus cognitively normal individuals. Higher baseline functional reserve was associated with lower concurrent dementia severity and slower clinical progression and attenuated the association of cognition with concurrent dementia severity. Physical function and apathy were the strongest predictors of functional reserve. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide preliminary validation of functional reserve for explaining individual differences in susceptibility to IADL dysfunction independent of neuropathology, cognition, and demographics. Physical functioning and apathy are promising modifiable intervention targets to enhance functional reserve in the context of brain atrophy and cognitive decline.

Y1  - 2021/01/01
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of cognitive and emotional impairments one year after first-ever mild stroke in younger patients Design: Prospective, observational, cohort study. SUBJECTS: A consecutive sample of 117 previously cognitively healthy patients aged 18-70 years with mild stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≤ 3) were included in 2 hospitals in Norway during a 2-year period. METHODS: At 12-month follow-up, patients were assessed using validated instruments for essential cognitive domains, fatigue, depression, anxiety, apathy and pathological laughter and crying. RESULTS: In total, 78 patients (67%) had difficulty with one or a combination of the cognitive domains psychomotor speed, attention, executive and visuospatial function, and memory. Furthermore, 50 patients (43%) had impairment in either one or a combination of the emotional measures for anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, apathy or emotional lability. A total of 32 patients (28%) had both cognitive and emotional impairments. Only 21 patients (18%) scored within the reference range in all the cognitive and emotional tools. CONCLUSION: Hidden impairments are common after first-ever mild stroke in younger patients. Stroke physicians should screen for hidden impairments using appropriate tools.

T1  - Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms that Predict Cognitive Decline or Impairment in Cognitively Normal Middle-Aged or Older Adults: a Meta-Analysis
LA  - eng
SN  - 1573-6660
Y1  - 2020/12/
ET  - 2020/05/11
AB  - Epidemiological studies have revealed that behavioral and psychological (or non-cognitive) symptoms are risk factors for cognitive decline in older adults. This study aimed to systematically review the literature and determine which behavioral and psychological symptoms are most predictive of future cognitive decline among individuals with no pre-existing cognitive impairments. The selected studies included middle-aged or older adults without cognitive impairments. The predictors were assessed using behavioral and psychological questionnaires, or diagnostic interviews, to identify non-cognitive symptoms or psychiatric clinical conditions. The follow-up period was at least one year, and the design of the selected studies was either retrospective or prospective. This study compared individuals with and without non-cognitive manifestations and resulted in one of three outcomes: (a) a score change on a cognitive measure, (b) a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, or (c) a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Four online databases were searched for eligible studies from the database inception to January 17, 2017: MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (OVID), PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Pooled effect sizes were estimated using a random-effect model. Higgins I(2), the Q statistic, and tau-squared were used to quantify the observed heterogeneity between the studies. Results indicate that depression and sleep duration (long and short) were the most consistent associations between behavioral or psychological symptoms and cognitive decline. This meta-analysis supports the need to assess behavioral and psychological symptoms in cognitively intact older adults to identify those who are at risk for cognitive decline.

T1  - Lesions in the right Rolandic operculum are associated with self-rating affective and apathetic depressive symptoms for post-stroke patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 2045-2322
Y1  - 2020/11/20
AB  - Stroke survivors majorly suffered from post-stroke depression (PSD). The PSD diagnosis is commonly performed based on the clinical cut-off for psychometric inventories. However, we hypothesized that PSD involves spectrum symptoms (e.g., apathy, depression, anxiety, and stress domains) and severity levels. Therefore, instead of using the clinical cut-off, we suggested a data-driven analysis to interpret patient spectrum conditions. The patients' psychological conditions were categorized in an unsupervised manner using the k-means clustering method, and the relationships between psychological conditions and quantitative lesion degrees were evaluated. This study involved one hundred sixty-five patient data; all patients were able to understand and perform self-rating psychological conditions (i.e., no aphasia). Four severity levels-low, low-to-moderate, moderate-to-high, and high-were observed for each combination of two psychological domains. Patients with worse conditions showed the significantly greater lesion degree at the right Rolandic operculum (part of Brodmann area 43). The dissimilarities between stress and other domains were also suggested. Patients with high stress were specifically associated with lesions in the left thalamus. Impaired emotion processing and stress-affected functions have been frequently related to those lesion regions. Those lesions were also robust and localized, suggesting the possibility of an objective for predicting psychological conditions from brain lesions.

T1  - Regional White Matter Integrity Predicts Treatment Response to Escitalopram and Memantine in Geriatric Depression: A Pilot Study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1664-0640
SN  - 1664-0640
Y1  - 2020/11/17
AB  - Background: Geriatric depression with subjective memory complaints increases the risk for Alzheimer's Disease. Memantine, a neuroprotective drug, can improve depression and help prevent cognitive decline. In our 6-months clinical trial, escitalopram/memantine (ESC/MEM) improved mood and cognition compared to escitalopram/placebo treatment (ESC/PBO; NCT01902004). In this report, we investigated whether baseline brain white matter integrity in fronto-limbic-striatal tracts can predict clinical outcomes using fractional anisotropy (FA). Methods: Thirty-eight older depressed adults (mean age = 70.6, SD = 7.2) were randomized to ESC/MEM or ESC/PBO and underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at 3 Tesla at baseline. Mood was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), apathy using the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) and anxiety using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) at baseline and 6-months follow-up. FA was extracted from seven tracts of interest (six in each hemisphere and one commissural tract) associated with geriatric depression. Non-parametric General Linear Models were used to examine group differences in the association between FA and symptom improvement, controlling for age, sex, baseline symptom scores and scanner model, correcting for false discovery rate (FDR). Post-hoc tests further investigated group differences in axial, mean and radial diffusivity (AD, MD, and RD, respectively). Lastly, we performed an exploratory whole-brain model to test whether FA might be related to treatment response with memantine. Results: There were no differences in remission rates or HAMD change between groups. In bilateral anterior and posterior internal capsule tracts and bilateral inferior and right superior fronto-occipital (IFO and SFO) fasciculus, higher FA was associated with larger improvements in depressive symptoms for ESC/MEM, but not ESC/PBO, correcting for FDR. Lower MD in the left IFO and RD in the right anterior internal capsule were associated with improved treatment responses. We found no significant associations in the whole-brain analysis. Limitations: Included small sample size and high dropout. Conclusions: Higher baseline FA and lower RD and MD in hypothesized fronto-limbic-striatal tracts predicted greater improvement in mood and anxiety with ESC/MEM compared to ESC/PBO in geriatric depression. FA as a biomarker for white matter integrity may serve as a predictor of treatment response but requires confirmation in larger future studies.

T1  - Mental Health Status of Psychogeriatric Patients During the 2019 New Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic and Effects on Caregiver Burden

AB  - Introduction: There is a growing awareness about the noxious effects of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental health of the elderly. However, there is limited information from clinically driven research. The objectives of the present study were to examine the magnitude of psychiatric symptoms and to determine their association with caregiver distress, in a cross-section of community-dwelling older adults and a subsample of aging adults with Down syndrome (DS) attending a psychogeriatric service in São Paulo, Brazil. Method: Telephone-based interviews and electronically filled self-assessment questionnaires were used to collect information from patients and caregivers, addressing their impressions and concerns about the pandemic and related effects on the patient's emotional state and behavior. Clinical information was obtained from hospital charts, medical records, and psychometric tests administered through telephone interviews [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q)]. Results: We included 100 consecutive participants, comprising 71 older adults with psychogeriatric/neurocognitive disorders and 29 aging adults with DS. Higher HADS and NPI-Q scores were significantly associated with caregiver distress (p < 0.05) in both groups. Correlation analyses indicated strong, positive associations between caregiver burden and scores in HADS anxiety (HADS-A) and HADS depression (HADS-D) scales in the subsamples of euploid and DS subjects. Higher NPI-Q scores in the former group were also correlated with caregiver distress, with stronger associations for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Similar findings were observed among DS subjects. ANOVA tests indicated significant associations between NPI-Q scores and caregiver distress among dementia patients, as well as with HADS scores. Similar results were found after multiple linear regressions; as such, among the elderly subsample, higher scores in HADS-A (p = 0.002) and HADS-D (p = 0.001) predict a significant impact on caregiver burden (p < 0.00001, R (2) 0.46); taking into consideration caregiver burden as a dependent variable and NPI-Q total score as an independent variable, we obtained significant strong prediction values for either DS (p < 0.00001, R (2) 0.95) or elderly adults (p < 0.00001, R (2) 0.88). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with neurocognitive disorders present with clinically relevant neuropsychiatric symptoms, with significant impact on caregiver distress. Apathy, aberrant motor behavior, sleep disorders, and psychoses were the main psychopathological domains, which had determined caregiver burden worsening.

T1  - Apathy Classification Based on Doppler Radar Image for the Elderly Person
LA  - eng
SN  - 2296-4185
SN  - 2296-4185
Y1  - 2020/11/03
AB  - Apathy is a disease characterized by diminished motivation not attributable to a diminished level of consciousness, cognitive impairment, or emotional distress. It is a serious problem facing the elderly in today's society. The diagnosis of apathy needs to be done at a clinic, which is particularly inconvenient and difficult for elderly patients. In this work, we examine the possibility of using doppler radar imaging for the classification of apathy in the elderly. We recruited 178 elderly participants to help create a dataset by having them fill out a questionnaire and submit to doppler radar imaging while performing a walking action. We selected walking because it is one of the most common actions in daily life and potentially contains a variety of useful health information. We used radar imaging rather than an RGB camera due to the greater privacy protection it affords. Seven machine learning models, including our proposed one, which uses a neural network, were applied to apathy classification using the walking doppler radar images of the elderly. Before classification, we perform a simple image pre-processing for feature extraction. This pre-processing separates every walking doppler radar image into four parts on the vertical and horizontal axes and the number of feature points is then counted in every separated part after binarization to create eight features. In this binarization, the optimized threshold is obtained by experimentally sliding the threshold. We found that our proposed neural network achieved an accuracy of more than 75% in apathy classification. This accuracy is not as high as that of other object classification methods in current use, but as an initial research in this area, it demonstrates the potential of apathy classification using doppler radar images for the elderly. We will examine ways of increasing the accuracy in future work.

T1  - A Survey of Usage of Penile Prosthesis
LA  - eng
SN  - 1743-6109
Y1  - 2020/11/
ET  - 2020/08/31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Implantation of an inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) has high success and satisfaction rates, but there remains a paucity of evidence examining non-usage of IPP and reasons for discontinuation. AIM: To identify how frequent patients use their prosthesis and their personal reasons for no longer using it. METHODS: We conducted a survey of all patients who underwent an IPP implantation by a single surgeon over a 6-year period, between 2012 and 2018. After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 114 patients formed the final cohort. Patients were initially surveyed via mail with a questionnaire; those who did not respond were surveyed via telephone. The factors determining patient selection for IPP implantation included suitability for general anesthesia, manual dexterity to use the device by the patient or their partner on a demonstration device, and presence of refractory erectile dysfunction, HbA1C lower than 8.5, or need for a revision of a previously placed IPP. Universally, a 3-piece AMS 700 Series implant was placed via the penoscrotal approach. Data were analyzed with Pearson chi square test, and survivability of the device was assessed with Kaplan-Meier survival curve. OUTCOMES: The main outcomes of this study are the frequency of IPP usage and reasons for discontinuation. RESULTS: The survey participation rate was 97%. The mean age of patient was 64 years (range 34-83 years), and the mean time between surgery and completion of survey was 2.98 years (range 0.25-7.4 years). Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrated that 68% of the patients were using the IPP at 5 years after implantation. Using the age 70 years as a cutoff, 18 (22%) patients younger than 70 years and 14 (42%) patients older than 70 years discontinued using the IPP (P = .029). The commonest reasons for discontinuation were poor health to engage in sexual activity (2.6%), loss of companion (19%), loss of interest in sex (2.6%), and device malfunction with no further interest in revision of prosthesis (14%). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The clinical implication of this study was improved patient selection for device implantation. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: To our knowledge, no other study has investigated reasons for patients no longer using their prosthesis. Our study has several limitations including that it is a cross-sectional analysis, our survey is not validated, this is a single-surgeon experience, we have a small sample size, and we did not differentiate between virgin implant and reimplantation. CONCLUSION: Our study shows a high rate (28%) of non-usage of IPP, more so in men older than the age of 70 years in the first 5 years of implantation. Knoll P, Rai S, Talluri S, et al.

T1  - Development of a Thai tool for assessing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: A confirmatory factor analysis
LA  - eng
SN  - 2162-3279
Y1  - 2020/11/
ET  - 2020/08/28
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The early recognition and management of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are important to inform treatment decisions. Current BPSD screening tools are time-consuming and require advanced skills, limiting their application in routine clinical practice. An easier and quicker tool for use by nonphysician healthcare personnel is needed. METHODS: A 14-item, Thai-language, BPSD scoring system for dementia (BPSD-T) was developed, based on clinical surveys and modifications after a pilot study. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), BPSD-T, Thai Mental State Examination (TMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), and Barthel Index were performed. BPSD-T and NPI scores were compared, and test validity and reliability were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 168 people with dementia (mean age, 80.7 ± 6.7 years) and their primary caregivers were recruited. A total of 105 (62.5%) subjects were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 31 (18.5%) with AD with small-vessel disease. The Global CDR was 0.5-1 for 73.8% of subjects, and 2-3 for 26.2%. The BPSD-T content validity index was 0.80-0.98, with high inter-rater and test-retest reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis showed the goodness of fit of 5 clusters of BPSD-T included a psychomotor syndrome (aggression, irritability, delusions, insomnia), an affective syndrome (apathy, repeating, anxiety, depression), a psychosis syndrome (misidentification, hallucinations), a behavior syndrome (hoarding, rummaging, wandering), and a euphoria syndrome (euphoria). Convergent validity showed a high correlation of the frequency score (r = 0.66) and caregiver distress score (r = 0.76) with the NPI. The BPSD-T score was significantly higher with more severe dementia. The average completion time for the BPSD-T (230.9 ± 65.5 s) was significantly less than that for NPI (506 ± 196.9 s; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: BPSD-T is a quick, reliable, and valid test to evaluate BPSD from the common dementia subtypes and severity, with a good correlation with the NPI. Its application in routine clinical practice will enable earlier recognition, targeted intervention, improved quality of care, and reduced caregiver burden.

T1  - Is it the time to implement the routine use of distress thermometer among Egyptian patients with newly diagnosed cancer?
LA  - eng
SN  - 1471-2407
Y1  - 2020/10/27
AB  - BACKGROUND: The distress thermometer (DT) is an effective tool for identifying distress among cancer patients worldwide. However, DT has not been studied in Egyptian patients. We aimed to study the prevalence of distress among Egyptian patients with different types of cancers using DT. METHODS: A total of 550 patients with newly diagnosed hematological and solid cancers who were followed up at 3 Oncology Centers in Egypt were enrolled. They completed a sociodemographic and clinical status questionnaire, the DT and the Problem List (PL) scale. RESULTS: At a DT cut-off score of ≥4, 46% of patients had significant distress, which was related to the tumor site and stage. The most frequent problems reported were treatment decision (64.4%), worry (47%), and fears (44.5%). In univariate logistic regression analysis, participants who had significant distress described 23 out of 36 problems in the practical, family, emotional, and physical areas. After adjustment to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, multivariable analysis confirmed that insurance, depression, fear, sadness, worry, loss of interest in usual activity, and sleep were independent factors associated with significant distress in cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of Egyptian patients newly diagnosed with cancer reported significant distress. Those who had significant distress described extra problems in the practical, family, emotional, and physical areas. We recommend the routine use of DT for screening Egyptian patients with cancer, as well as the involvement of the psycho-oncology and social services, at the time of their initial diagnosis.

T1  - Spanish Adaptation of the Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
LA  - eng

Y1  - 2020/10/06
AB  - Aim: To adapt, translate, and utilize the Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) to the Spanish population. Method: We recruited 104 ALS patients (67 of their caregivers) and 49 controls. Participants completed the Spanish-translated DAS, Geriatric Depression Scale- Short form. Patients were also administered the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R). Caregivers additionally completed the informant/caregiver-rated Spanish-translated DAS. The DAS was translated to Spanish using a back-translation method. Test-retest and internal consistency reliability were examined. Divergent validity was assessed by comparing the DAS with the depression scale (GDS-15). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to explore the substructure of the Spanish DAS. Results: The internal consistency reliability of self-rated Spanish DAS was 0.72 and of the informant/caregiver-rated Spanish DAS was 0.84. Correlations between self-rated DAS subscales and GDS-15 were not statistically significant, with a good test-retest reliability. PCA analysis showed a similar substructure to the original DAS. ALS patients had significantly higher Initiation apathy than controls. Additionally, ALS patient informant/caregiver-rated DAS Emotional apathy was significantly higher than the self-rated, with no significant differences observed in the Executive and Initiation subscales. No association was found between DAS and functional impairment using the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R). Conclusion: The Spanish translation of the DAS is valid and reliable for use in assessing multidimensional apathy in the Spanish population. Availability of the Spanish DAS will allow for future research to explore different apathy subtypes and their impact in ALS and other conditions.

T1  - The suicide crisis syndrome: A network analysis
LA  - eng
SN  - 0022-0167
Y1  - 2020/10/
ET  - 2020/04/20
AB  - Recent studies introduced the suicide crisis syndrome (SCS), a condition associated with imminent suicidal behavior and characterized by (a) a pervasive feeling of entrapment in which the escape from an unbearable life situation is perceived as both urgent and impossible (Criterion A) and (b) affective disturbance, loss of cognitive control, hyperarousal, and social withdrawal (Criterion B). The goal of the present study was to use some of the analytic tools provided by network analyses to further the understanding of the psychological, emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and physiological processes involved in the SCS by testing (a) whether the different symptoms of the proposed syndrome are related to each other, (b) whether symptoms form meaningful clusters, and (c) whether certain symptoms are more central than others. The study included 500 outpatient and 223 inpatient participants. A network analysis of the participants' scores on the various symptoms of the SCS was conducted. The network analysis suggested that most SCS symptoms are linked by strong connections and that entrapment and ruminative flooding are highly correlated with the other SCS symptoms. Three clusters of symptoms were identified, suggesting the existence of several interdependent psychological processes potentially involved in SCS phenomenology. Our findings support both the suggested symptoms of the SCS and the central role of entrapment in the proposed criteria for the syndrome. Emotional pain appears to be closely linked to entrapment and may belong in Criterion A. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

T1  - White matter hyperintensities: a marker for apathy in Parkinson's disease without dementia?
LA  - eng
SN  - 2328-9503
Y1  - 2020/09/
ET  - 2020/08/28
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and the occurrence and progression of apathy in Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: We recruited patients with PD who underwent baseline evaluation, which included apathy assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) head scans. After 2.5 years of follow-up, we re-evaluated patient apathy symptoms. The severity and location of WMH were assessed with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences using the Fazekas visual rating scale. Logistic regression and linear regression analyses of baseline WMH characteristics were conducted to explore the potential association between apathy and WMH. RESULTS: A total of 141 PD patients were recruited. The apathy group had a higher proportion of male patients, advanced disease, and depression, which was coupled with a lower quality of life. Morever, higher WMH severity was significantly associated with apathy. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that WMH severity was a risk factor for apathy. In addition, linear regression analysis also suggests that apathy severity is positively correlated with baseline WMH Fazekas scales (ϐ = 0.959, P < 0.001). Baseline WMH severity was also a risk factor for apathy progression. INTERPRETATION: WMH is associated with apathy and could be a promising marker to predict apathy progression in PD.

T1  - Patient-reported outcomes in maintenance hemodialysis: a cross-sectional, multicenter study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1573-2649
Y1  - 2020/09/
ET  - 2020/04/30
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to assess patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) related to symptoms among maintenance hemodialysis patients (MHDp). METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between 2013 and 2015, with 336 MHDp from five hospital hemodialysis units. It included a comprehensive assessment of the prevalence and intensity of 30 common dialysis-related symptoms quality of life and daily function of MHDp, by using the Dialysis Symptom Index (DSI), Quality of Life Short Form (KDQOL-SF), and demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: The five most commonly reported symptoms were identified as tiredness (80%), difficulty becoming sexually aroused (72%), decreased interest in sex (72%), worrying (67%), trouble staying asleep (65%), and trouble falling asleep (64%). Based on the DSI, the mean Overall Burden of Symptoms (OBS), on a scale of 0-30, was 15.4 ± 6.7, while the mean Overall Symptom Severity Score (OSSS), on a scale of 0-150, was 54.8 ± 29.8. Multivariate quantile regression models indicated that major depression is consistently associated with both the OBS and OSSS across different quantiles, whereas time on dialysis > 24 months was associated with the OBS only. Both the OBS and OSSS were inversely associated with KDQOL-SF: the kidney-related (KDCS), physical (PCS) and mental aspects (MCS), across multiple quantiles in multivariate quantile regression models. CONCLUSIONS: MHDp bear a heavy burden of symptom which are associated with time spent on dialysis as well as depression. Clinical and research resources should be directed at controlling symptoms, improving daily function, detecting depression, and bettering quality of life.

T1  - Parkinson disease clinical subtypes: key features & clinical milestones
LA  - eng
SN  - 2328-9503
Y1  - 2020/08/
ET  - 2020/06/29
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Based on multi-domain classification of Parkinson disease (PD) subtypes, we sought to determine the key features that best differentiate subtypes and the utility of PD subtypes to predict clinical milestones. METHODS: Prospective cohort of 162 PD participants with ongoing, longitudinal follow-up. Latent class analysis (LCA) delineated subtypes based on score patterns across baseline motor, cognitive, and psychiatric measures. Discriminant analyses identified key features that distinguish subtypes at baseline. Cox regression models tested PD subtype differences in longitudinal conversion to clinical milestones, including deep brain stimulation (DBS), dementia, and mortality. RESULTS: LCA identified distinct subtypes: "motor only" (N = 63) characterized by primary motor deficits; "psychiatric & motor" (N = 17) characterized by prominent psychiatric symptoms and moderate motor deficits; "cognitive & motor" (N = 82) characterized by impaired cognition and moderate motor deficits. Depression, executive function, and apathy best discriminated subtypes. Since enrollment, 22 had DBS, 48 developed dementia, and 46 have died. Although there were no subtype differences in rate of DBS, dementia occurred at a higher rate in the "cognitive & motor" subtype. Surprisingly, mortality risk was similarly elevated for both "cognitive & motor" and "psychiatric & motor" subtypes compared to the "motor only" subtype (relative risk = 3.15, 2.60). INTERPRETATION: Psychiatric and cognitive features, rather than motor deficits, distinguish clinical PD subtypes and predict greater risk of subsequent dementia and mortality. These results emphasize the value of multi-domain assessments to better characterize clinical variability in PD. Further, differences in dementia and mortality rates demonstrate the prognostic utility of PD subtypes.

T1  - Validation and adaptation of the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) in fitness group exercisers

Y1  - 2020/07/

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, Mullen et al. (2011) presented an 8-item version of the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) that provides a valid instrument for assessing enjoyment in physical activity. The present paper investigated the psychometric properties of a Portuguese adaptation of PACES. METHODS: After a process of back-to-back translation into Portuguese, 395 members of fitness centers who ranged in age from 18 to 66 years (31.11 ± 8.90, mean ± SD) completed the translated version of the PACES. On average, participants had 3.2 years of experience in fitness group classes and practiced for approximately 3.3 times per week. RESULTS: An initial exploratory factor analysis (n = 139) revealed a unidimensional structure with factor loadings ranging from 0.79 to 0.89. Results also showed acceptable internal consistency. A confirmatory factor analysis in an independent sample (n = 256) provided additional support for the unidimensional structure of the questionnaire. In addition, moderate positive correlations between enjoyment and intrinsic and identified regulation, and moderate negative correlations between enjoyment and external and amotivation, demonstrate the convergent validity of the instrument. Finally, measurement invariance between 2 independent samples was also found. CONCLUSION: The 8-item Portuguese version of PACES is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring enjoyment of physical activity in Portuguese adult fitness exercisers, and it is therefore suitable to use as a measure of affect in exercise adherence interventions studies.

T1  - The association of eating challenges with energy intake is moderated by the mealtime environment in residential care homes
LA  - eng
SN  - 1741-203X
Y1  - 2020/07/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Given the increased risk of malnutrition in residential care homes, we studied how specific aspects of the mealtime environment are associated with residents' eating challenges and energy intake in general and dementia care units of these homes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: 624 residents and 82 dining rooms. SETTING: 32 residential care homes across Canada. MEASUREMENTS: Eating challenges were measured using the Edinburgh Feeding Evaluation in Dementia Questionnaire (Ed-FED-q). Energy intake was estimated over nine meals. Physical, social, person-centered, functional, and homelike aspects of the mealtime environment were scored using standardized, valid measures. Effects of interactions between dining environment scores and eating challenges on daily energy intake were assessed using linear regression. RESULTS: More eating challenges were associated with decreased energy intake on the general (β = -36.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -47.8, -25.2) and dementia care units (β = -19.9, 95% CI = -34.6, -5.2). Among residents living on general care units, the functional (β = 48.5, 95% CI = 1.8, 95.2) and physical (β = 56.9, 95% CI = 7.2, 106.7) environment scores were positively and directly associated with energy intake; the social and person-centered aspects of the mealtime environment moderated the relationship between eating challenges and energy intake. CONCLUSIONS: Resident eating challenges were significantly associated with energy intake on both dementia care and general care units; however on general care units, when adjusting for eating challenges, the functional and physical aspects of the environment also had a direct effect on energy intake. Furthermore, the social and person-centered aspects of the dining environment on general care units moderated the relationship between eating challenges and energy intake. Dementia care unit environments had no measurable effect on the association between resident eating challenges and energy intake.

T1  - Health care use and treatment-seeking for depression symptoms in rural India: an exploratory cross-sectional analysis
LA  - eng
SN  - 1472-6963
Y1  - 2020/04/06
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a large "treatment gap" for depression worldwide. This study aimed to better understand the treatment gap in rural India by describing health care use and treatment-seeking for depression. METHODS: Data were analysed from a two round cross-sectional community survey conducted in rural Madhya Pradesh between May 2013 and December 2016. We examined the proportion of individuals who screened positive for depression (≥10) on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) who sought treatment in different sectors, for depression symptoms and for any reason, and compared the latter with health service use by screen-negative individuals. We analysed the frequency with which barriers to healthcare utilisation were reported by screen-positive adults. We also analysed the association between seeking treatment for depression and various predisposing, enabling and need factors using univariable regression. RESULTS: 86% of screen-positive adults reported seeking no depression treatment. However, 66% had used health services for any reason in the past 3 months, compared to 46% of screen-negative individuals (p < 0.0001). Private providers were most frequently consulted by screen-positive adults (32%), while only 19% consulted traditional providers. Structural barriers to healthcare use such as cost and distance to services were frequently reported (54 and 52%, respectively) but were not associated with treatment-seeking for depression. The following factors were found to be positively associated with treatment-seeking for depression: higher symptom severity; lack of energy, lack of interest/pleasure, low self-esteem, or slow movements/restlessness on more than 7 days in the past 2 weeks; being married; having discussed depression symptoms; and reporting problems with medication availability and supply as a barrier to healthcare. No evidence was found for an association between treatment-seeking for depression and most socio-economic, demographic or attitudinal factors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the majority of adults who screen positive for depression seek healthcare, although not primarily for depression symptoms, indicating the need to improve detection of depression during consultations about other complaints. Private providers may need to be considered in programmes to improve depression treatment in this setting. Further research should test the hypotheses generated in this descriptive study, such as the potential role of marriage in facilitating treatment-seeking.

T1  - The usefulness and prognostic value of Memorial Symptom Assessment-Short Form and Condensed Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale in assessment of lung cancer patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 1433-7339
Y1  - 2020/04/
ET  - 2019/08/06
AB  - PURPOSE: Lung cancer is associated with high level of symptoms and patient-reported symptoms have been rarely used as a prognostic score to predict patients survival. METHODS: Frequency and burden of symptoms in lung cancer patients were evaluated before the diagnosis with the Memorial Symptom Assessment-Short Form (MSAS-SF) and Condensed Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (CMSAS) questionnaires. Performance status, stage of disease, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were recorded. Patients were staged according to 8th TNM classification. A survival analysis was applied. RESULTS: The mean age of 116 patients (adenocarcinoma 51, squamous cell 43, non-small cell 5, small cell 17) was 65.2 ± 10.1 (28-87) years. The most common seen physical and psychological symptoms were cough (86.3%), lack of energy (74.3%), dyspnea (70.1%), and feeling sad (61.5%), feeling nervous (61.5%), and worrying (53.8%). Total and subscores of MSAS and CMSAS are significantly higher in M1 disease than M0 disease. All MSAS-SF and CMSAS scores, but not MSAS-PSYCH and CMSAS-PSYCH, positively correlated with age, high serum CRP, white blood cells/neutrophils counts, and TNM stage, and negatively correlated with albumin levels, performance status, and overall survival (OS). Median survival was 77, 195, 370, and 579 days for the four prognostic interquartile groups according to CMSAS-SUM score (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: MSAS-SF and CMSAS questionnaires can be useful tool for discriminating metastatic from non-metastatic disease in treatment-naïve patients with lung cancer. Since both questionnaires well correlated with OS and important prognostic factors, they can use to plan palliative care and to help for predicting survival of lung cancer patients.

T1  - Feasibility of the Audio Recorded Cognitive Screen in the Assessment of Individuals Undergoing Electroconvulsive Therapy
LA  - eng
SN  - 1533-4112
Y1  - 2020/03/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monitoring for cognitive deficits during a course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is recommended, but cognitive assessment can be time consuming. The Audio Recorded Cognitive Screen (ARCS) is a cognitive test instrument with good psychometric properties that places minimal demands on clinicians' time, but until now, it has not been formally evaluated for monitoring cognition in the context of ECT treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the feasibility/utility of using the ARCS in the assessment of depressed patients undergoing ECT. METHODS: Depressed patients undergoing ECT were tested with the ARCS and a comparison instrument, the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), in counterbalance order immediately before any ECT and after the sixth ECT treatment episode. Apathy (Apathy Scale) and depression (Profile of Mood states Short Form) were measured on both occasions. Analyses compared performances on the 2 cognitive instruments and examined for associations with the measures of apathy or depression. RESULTS: Twenty-eight individuals (9 male, 19 female) aged 19 to 84 years underwent testing. Performances on the total ARCS were similar to those on the total RBANS, and both showed decline from baseline to follow-up. The total ARCS and RBANS measures correlated well (r = 0.75, P < 0.001). Neither apathy nor depression scores were significantly associated with scores on either the RBANS or ARCS. CONCLUSIONS: The ARCS was acceptable and convenient in the assessment of cognition in patients undergoing treatment with ECT. In light of its practical advantages, further evaluation of the ARCS for detecting cognitive impairment and tracking cognitive changes during ECT seems warranted.

T1  - Assessment of behavioral determinants influencing success of supervised exercise therapy in patients with intermittent claudication: A cross sectional survey
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-507X
Y1  - 2020/03/01
ET  - 2019/11/01
AB  - BACKGROUND: Supervised exercise therapy is the first step in treatment of intermittent claudication. However, adherence to supervised exercise therapy is low. Limited access and reimbursement issues are known reasons, though lack of motivation is often leading. Behavioral determinants influencing motivation and thus adherence to supervised exercise therapy remain to be investigated. In this study we sought to determine which behavioral determinants would be of influence on the long-term adherence of supervised exercise therapy. METHODS: 200 patients, newly diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease Rutherford classification II-III, were sent a questionnaire to assess motivation and behavior with regard to supervised exercise therapy. The questionnaire was constructed using the I-CHANGE model for explaining motivational and behavioral change. Baseline characteristics were acquired from medical records. Alpha Cronbach's was calculated to test reliability of the questionnaire. RESULTS: 108 (54%) patients returned their questionnaire. A total of 79% patients followed supervised exercise therapy. Patients who increased their walking distance after supervised exercise therapy have significantly greater knowledge (p = 0.05), positive attitude (p = 0.03) and lower negative attitude (p = 0.01). Patients with a higher self-efficacy remained significantly more active after participating in supervised exercise therapy (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Increasing the determinants knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy will improve adherence to supervised exercise therapy and result in delayed claudication onset time.

T1  - Performance and Symptom Validity Assessment in Patients with Apathy and Cognitive Impairment
LA  - eng
SN  - 1469-7661
Y1  - 2020/03/
ET  - 2019/10/29
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Performance and symptom validity tests (PVTs and SVTs) measure the credibility of the assessment results. Cognitive impairment and apathy potentially interfere with validity test performance and may thus lead to an incorrect (i.e., false-positive) classification of the patient's scores as non-credible. The study aimed at examining the false-positive rate of three validity tests in patients with cognitive impairment and apathy. METHODS: A cross-sectional, comparative study was performed in 56 patients with dementia, 41 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 41 patients with Parkinson's disease. Two PVTs - the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) and the Dot Counting Test (DCT) - and one SVT - the Structured Inventory of Malingered Symptomatology (SIMS) - were administered. Apathy was measured with the Apathy Evaluation Scale, and severity of cognitive impairment with the Mini Mental State Examination. RESULTS: The failure rate was 13.7% for the TOMM, 23.8% for the DCT, and 12.5% for the SIMS. Of the patients with data on all three tests (n = 105), 13.5% failed one test, 2.9% failed two tests, and none failed all three. Failing the PVTs was associated with cognitive impairment, but not with apathy. Failing the SVT was related to apathy, but not to cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with cognitive impairment or apathy, failing one validity test is not uncommon. Validity tests are differentially sensitive to cognitive impairment and apathy. However, the rule that at least two validity tests should be failed to identify non-credibility seemed to ensure a high percentage of correct classification of credibility.

AB  - Purpose/Objectives: To describe advanced cancer patient-spouse caregiver couples' cancer-related concerns, determine dyadic concordance of concerns, and predict concordance based on demographic characteristics.Design/Research Approach: Secondary analysis of cross-sectional self-report data.Sample/Participants: 88 advanced cancer patients and spouse self-identified caregivers.Methods/Methodological Approach: Participants individually completed questionnaires, including demographics and the Cancer Inventory of Problem Situations. Data are described and concordances were calculated using Kappa scores. Generalized Linear Modeling was used to predict concordances using demographic characteristics.Findings: The top patient concern was lack of energy, while the top spouse caregiver concern was worry about cancer. Couples generally had low concordance about concerns. Demographic characteristics did not significantly predict concordance.Conclusions/Interpretation: Low inter- and intra-dyadic congruence may suggest little communication within couples regarding cancer-related concerns.Implications for Psychosocial Providers or Policy: Healthcare providers should reinforce the importance of communication among patients and spouse caregivers to improve concordance and potentially reduce conflict.

T1  - Early Improvements of Individual Symptoms With Antipsychotics Predict Subsequent Treatment Response of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease: A Re-Analysis of the CATIE-AD Study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1555-2101
Y1  - 2020/02/11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to identify individual symptoms whose early improvements contributed to subsequent treatment response to antipsychotics for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using the dataset of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness-Alzheimer's Disease (CATIE-AD). METHODS: The CATIE-AD study was conducted between April 2001 and November 2004 at 45 sites in the United States. Data for 421 patients with DSM-IV AD with NPSs treated with antipsychotics were analyzed in the present study. Treatment response was defined as a reduction of ≥ 9 points in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score or a reduction of ≥ 25% from baseline in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total score at week 8. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine associations between response and clinical and demographic characteristics, including each total or individual symptom score reduction at week 2. RESULTS: Reduction in NPI or BPRS total score at week 2 and several individual symptom score reductions (euphoria/elation, irritability, hallucinations, anxiety, agitation, apathy, disinhibition, and depression among NPI subitems; excitement, suspiciousness, disorientation, hostility, depressive mood, and emotional withdrawal among BPRS subitems) at week 2 were significantly associated with subsequent treatment response at week 8 (all P values < .05); Early non-improvements of irritability and suspiciousness were shown to be especially influential clinical markers in predicting subsequent treatment nonresponse. Furthermore, healthier condition at baseline was significantly associated with treatment response at week 8 (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Although further research to validate these preliminary findings is needed, focusing on early improvements of individual symptoms could help identify subsequent treatment responders to antipsychotics in AD patients with NPSs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00015548.

T1  - The Value of Neuropsychological Assessment in the Differentiation Between Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia and Late-Onset Psychiatric Disorders
LA  - eng
SN  - 1555-2101
Y1  - 2020/02/04
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate which neuropsychological tests can discriminate between behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and psychiatric disorders presenting with similar late-onset frontal behavioral changes, such as apathy, disinhibition, reduced empathy, or compulsive behavior. METHODS: Patients presenting with frontal behavioral changes in middle or late adulthood received extensive baseline examinations, including neuropsychological assessment and brain imaging. After 2 years, examinations were repeated and patients were diagnosed according to DSM-IV or international bvFTD consensus criteria. The study period was April 2011-June 2015. Two groups were selected: 32 patients with bvFTD and 53 patients with a psychiatric or psychological diagnosis. Associations between neuropsychological test scores and diagnostic group were investigated with logistic regression analyses, and diagnostic accuracy was investigated with a receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: BvFTD patients scored lower on tests for confrontational naming, gestalt completion, and verbal abstraction compared to psychiatric patients (P < .01). The confrontational naming test (Boston Naming Test) showed the strongest association with diagnostic group: a lower score indicated a higher probability for a bvFTD diagnosis (P < .001). This test could discriminate between the groups with good diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve = 0.81). Tests for attention, memory, and executive functions showed no discriminative ability between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although one of the criteria of bvFTD is low performance on executive tests, these tests are not useful in differentiating bvFTD from psychiatric disorders. We recommend administering language tests, especially an extensive confrontational naming test, to aid differentiation between bvFTD and a psychiatric disorder in patients presenting with late-onset frontal behavioral changes.

T1  - The Edinburgh cognitive and behavioral amyotrophic lateral sclerosis screen (ECAS): sensitivity in differentiating between ALS and Alzheimer's disease in a Greek population
LA  - eng
SN  - 2167-9223
Y1  - 2020/02/
ET  - 2019/08/30
AB  - Objectives: (1) Adapt the ECAS into Greek, validate it in ALS patients and compare with the ALS-CBS. (2) Determine the sensitivity and specificity of ECAS in the differentiation between AD and non-demented ALS patients as compared with the ACE-III and mini-ACE. Methods: ALS patients (n = 28) were recruited and AD patients (n = 26) were matched in age, sex, and education with ALS patients (n = 24). The normative data were derived from a random sample of controls (n = 52). Bayes correlation analysis was conducted to examine convergent validity. Bayes t-test was performed to assess between groups' differences. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses and area under the curve (AUC) were implemented to appraise the sensitivity and specificity in the differentiation between the AD and non-demented ALS patients. Results: The ECAS and its sub-scores in addition to the behavior interview demonstrated robust correlations with the ALS-CBS. Impairment in language and verbal fluency were the most prominent deficits in the ALS patients. The most frequently reported change was apathy. The ROC analysis demonstrated that the ECAS-ALS nonspecific score (comprising memory and visuospatial domains) is the most sensitive and specific in differentiating the AD from ALS patients. The other measures expressed high sensitivity, yet a poor specificity. Conclusions: The ECAS is a multi-purpose screening tool. The ECAS-ALS specific appraises the whole spectrum of the highly prevalent cognitive impairments in ALS. The ECAS-ALS nonspecific (memory and visuospatial) is a sensitive score to detect AD related deficits and is able to differentiate the AD from the non-demented ALS patients better than the ACE-III and mini-ACE.

T1  - The brief Dimensional Apathy Scale: A short clinical assessment of apathy
LA  - eng
SN  - 1744-4144

ET  - 2019/06/03
AB  - Objective: Apathy is a prominent syndrome across neurodegenerative diseases. The Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) assesses three apathy subtypes-executive, emotional, and initiation-and is sensitive and valid in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease. This study describes the development of the brief DAS (b-DAS), which will enable apathy to be swiftly detected in the clinic.Method: 102 ALS and 102 AD patients' previously collected data were used. Mokken analyses were performed on item-level data of each informant/carer-rated DAS subscale (executive, emotional, and initiation) for the initial scale reduction. Item-total correlational analyses against standard apathy (convergent validity criteria) and depression (divergent validity criteria) measures and qualitative examination of items aided final item selection. Receiver operating curve analysis determined optimal cutoffs for the reduced subscales.Results: Mokken analyses suggested unidimensionality of each DAS subscale. Three items were removed that failed to satisfy monotone homogeneity model requirements, three items were removed due to validity criteria not being met, and six items were removed due to a combination of lower item scalability and item-total correlations. Item-theme examination further reduced the b-DAS to nine items, three per subscale, with a supplemental awareness deficit assessment being added. Sensitivity- and specificity-based optimal cutoffs were calculated for each b-DAS subscale.Conclusions: This study presents the b-DAS, an informant/carer-based robust yet short multidimensional apathy instrument with good convergent and divergent validity, with recommended clinical cutoffs. The b-DAS is appropriate for use in the clinic and for research to quickly and comprehensively screen for apathy subtype impairments.

T1  - Can Social Cognition Measurements Differentiate Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia from Alzheimer's Disease Regardless of Apathy?
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-8908
Y1  - 2020
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) share cognitive and behavioral symptoms, such as apathy. Social cognition measurements are useful in distinguishing bvFTD from AD, but their accuracies may be affected by apathy. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether social cognition measurements can distinguish bvFTD from either apathetic or non-apathetic AD patients. METHODS: Three groups of participants were enrolled in the present study: bvFTD (n = 22), AD (n = 20), and healthy controls (HC, n = 23). The AD group was divided into apathetic (n = 10) and non-apathetic (n = 10). All subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychological examination, including the short version of the Social and Emotional Assessment (Mini-SEA), which comprises the facial emotion recognition test and the faux-pas recognition test (Faux-Pas Test). Apathy was assessed according to the Starkstein's Apathy (SA) Scale. RESULTS: The bvFTD and AD groups did not differ on global cognitive efficiency and on executive functions. In comparison to the whole AD group, bvFTD displayed lower Faux-Pas Test and Mini-SEA scores. Both AD subgroups, apathetic or non-apathetic, exhibited similar performance on all social cognition measurements. In comparison to either apathetic AD or non-apathetic AD, bvFTD patients underperformed on the Faux-Pas Test and on the Mini-SEA. The area under the curve values for the Mini-SEA total score were 0.87 (bvFTD versus AD), 0.90 (bvFTD versus apathetic AD), and 0.83 (bvFTD versus non-apathetic AD). CONCLUSION: Social cognition tests provide accurate distinction between bvFTD against either apathetic AD or non-apathetic AD. Social cognition measurements did not correlate with apathy severity.

T1  - The "Interest Game": A Ludic Application to Improve Apathy Assessment in Patients with Neurocognitive Disorders
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-8908
Y1  - 2020
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy, a highly prevalent behavioral disorder in Alzheimer's disease and other related disorders, is currently assessed using clinical scales as it is for all neuropsychiatric disorders. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to propose a new type of assessment using new technologies designed to assess loss of interest by a more implicit and indirect method. METHODS: The Interest Game is a form of interactive self-report, where categories of interests are presented in order to quantify them and identify the activities that constitute them. Two indices can be extracted, the number of categories and the number of activities selected. We compared the scores between three groups: Apathetic (A) and Non-Apathetic (NA) subjects (according to the Apathy Diagnostic Criteria) and controls with no objective cognitive impairment. RESULTS: 95 subjects were included. Results showed that subjects from the A group had significantly less interests (both categories and images selected) than the NA group. As expected, the control group selected a higher number of categories than the other groups. The diagnosis (minor or major neurocognitive disorder) and level of education had also a significant effect on the number of categories selected. Furthermore, subjects with major neurocognitive disorder (NCD) had significantly less interests than minor NCD group. The number of categories measure was more sensitive than the number of images selected. CONCLUSION: The Interest Game is a promising tool to quantify and identify subject interests and differentiate between apathetic and non-apathetic subjects. Future studies should focus on including more apathetic subjects in the minor NCD group and validating this tool with the general population.

T1  - Apathy and anxiety are early markers of Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1558-1497
Y1  - 2020/01/
ET  - 2019/10/19
AB  - In this study, we investigated associations between neuropsychiatric symptoms (i.e., apathy, anxiety, and depression) and cerebral atrophy, white matter lesions (WML), beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, and cognitive decline in a nondemented sample. 104 cognitively unimpaired and 53 subjects with mild cognitive impairment were followed for up to 4 years within the Swedish BioFINDER study. Neuropsychiatric assessments included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Apathy Evaluation Scale. Magnetic resonance imaging and (18)F-flutemetamol-positron emission tomography quantified brain atrophy, WML, and Aβ deposition. Mini-Mental State Examination assessed longitudinal global cognition. Regression analyses were used to test for associations. Apathy and anxiety were shown related to Aβ deposition and predicted cognitive decline. Anxiety also interacted with amyloid status to predict faster cognitive deterioration. Apathy was further related to frontotemporal and subcortical atrophy, as well as WML. To conclude, the associations between apathy and anxiety with Aβ deposition and cognitive decline point to these symptoms as early clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the longitudinal course of non-motor symptoms, and finding markers to predict cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD), are priorities. Previous work has demonstrated that apathy is one of the only behavioural symptoms that differentiates people with PD and intact cognition from those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI-PD). Other psychiatric symptoms emerge as dementia in PD develops. OBJECTIVE: We explored statistical models of longitudinal change to detect apathy as a behavioural predictor of cognitive decline in PD. METHODS: We followed 104 people with PD intermittently over 2 years, undertaking a variety of motor, behavioural and cognitive measures. We applied a linear mixed effects model to explore behavioural factors associated with cognitive change over time. Our approach goes beyond conventional modelling based on a random-intercept and slope approach, and can be used to examine the variability in measures within individuals over time. RESULTS: Global cognitive scores worsened during the two-year follow-up, whereas the longitudinal evolution of self-rated apathy scores and other behavioural measures was negligible. Level of apathy was negatively (- 0.598) correlated with level of cognitive impairment and participants with higher than average apathy scores at baseline also had poorer cognition. The model indicated that departure from the mean apathy score at any point in time was mirrored by a corresponding departure from average global cognitive score. CONCLUSION: High levels of apathy are predictive of negative cognitive and behavioural outcomes over time, suggesting that apathy may be a behavioural indicator of early cognitive decline. This has clinical and prognostic implications.

AB  - Depression remains poorly managed in oncology, in part because of the difficulty of reliably screening and assessing for depression in the context of medical illness. Whether somatic items really skew the ability to identify "true" depression, or represent meaningful indicators of depression, remains to be determined. This study utilized item response theory (IRT) to compare the performance of traditional depression criteria with Endicott's substitutive criteria (ESC; tearfulness or depressed appearance; social withdrawal; brooding; cannot be cheered up). The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), ESC, and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) were administered to 558 outpatients with cancer. IRT models were utilized to evaluate global and item fit for traditional PHQ-9 items compared with a modified version replacing the 4 somatic items with ESC. The modified PHQ-9 ESC scale was the best fit using a partial credit model; model fit was improved after collapsing the middle 2 response categories and removing psychomotor agitation/retardation. This improved model showed satisfactory scale precision and internal consistency, and was free from differential item functioning for gender, age, and race. Concurrent and criterion validity were supported. Thus, as many have speculated, utilizing the ESC may result in more accurate identification of depressive symptoms in oncology. Depressed mood, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation retained their expected properties in the modified scale, indicating that the traditional underlying syndrome of depression likely remains the same, but the ESC may provide more specificity when assessing patients with cancer.

T1  - Validation of the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory Observational (CMAI-O) tool
LA  - eng
SN  - 1741-203X
Y1  - 2020/01/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Behaviours associated with agitation are common in people living with dementia. The Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) is a 29-item scale widely used to assess agitation completed by a proxy (family carer or staff member). However, proxy informants introduce possible reporting bias when blinding to the treatment arm is not possible, and potential accuracy issues due to irregular contact between the proxy and the person with dementia over the reporting period. An observational measure completed by a blinded researcher may address these issues, but no agitation measures with comparable items exist. DESIGN: Development and validation of an observational version of the CMAI (CMAI-O), to assess its validity as an alternative or complementary measure of agitation. SETTING: Fifty care homes in England. PARTICIPANTS: Residents (N = 726) with dementia. MEASUREMENTS: Two observational measures (CMAI-O and PAS) were completed by an independent researcher. Measures of agitation, functional status, and neuropsychiatric symptoms were completed with staff proxies. RESULTS: The CMAI-O showed adequate internal consistency (α = .61), criterion validity with the PAS (r = .79, p = < .001), incremental validity in predicting quality of life beyond the Functional Assessment Staging of Alzheimer's disease (β = 1.83, p < .001 at baseline) and discriminant validity from the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Apathy subscale (r = .004, p = .902). CONCLUSIONS: The CMAI-O is a promising research tool for independently measuring agitation in people with dementia in care homes. Its use alongside the CMAI could provide a more robust understanding of agitation amongst residents with dementia.

T1  - A network approach on the relation between apathy and depression symptoms with dementia and functional disability
LA  - eng
SN  - 1741-203X
Y1  - 2019/11/
ET  - 2019/02/20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on the association between depression and dementia risk mostly use sum scores on depression questionnaires to model symptomatology severity. Since individual items may contribute differently to this association, this approach has limited validity. METHODS: We used network analysis to investigate the functioning of individual Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) items, of which, based on studies that used factor analysis, 3 are generally considered to measure apathy (GDS-3A) and 12 depression (GDS-12D). Functional disability and future dementia were also included in our analysis. Data were extracted from 3229 participants of the Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular care trial (preDIVA), analyzed as a single cohort, yielding 20,542 person-years of observation. We estimated a sparse network by only including connections between variables that could not be accounted for by variance in other variables. For this, we used a repeated L1 regularized regression procedure. RESULTS: This procedure resulted in a selection of 59/136 possible connections. GDS-3A items were strongly connected to each other and with varying strength to several GDS-12D items. Functional disability was connected to all three GDS-3A items and the GDS-12D items "helplessness" and "worthlessness". Future dementia was only connected to the GDS-12D item "memory problems", which was in turn connected to the GDS-12D items "unhappiness" and "helplessness" and all three GDS-3A items. CONCLUSION: Network analysis reveals interesting relationships between GDS items, functional disability and dementia risk. We discuss what implications our results may have for (future) research on the associations between depression and/or apathy with dementia.

T1  - Design and validation of a new instrument to assess fear of falling in Parkinson's disease

SN  - 1531-8257
Y1  - 2019/10/
ET  - 2019/08/23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fear of falling may be significantly associated with falls in Parkinson's disease (PD) and may have a negative impact on quality of life. Nevertheless, there are no valid and reliable tools to examine this condition in PD. The objective of this study was to design and determine the psychometric attributes of an instrument to assess fear of falling in PD. METHODS: A prospective 1-year, 2-phase study was conducted to validate the Fear of Falling Scale, a self-assessed instrument for assessing fear of falling in PD. During phase 1, we designed a scale to measure the severity of fear of falling and determine its baseline psychometric characteristics, whereas phase 2 was a 1-year follow-up study to assess the frequency of falls and other clinical factors linked to fear of falling. Convergent and discriminant validity were assessed against the Fear of Falling Measure and the Starkstein Apathy Scale, respectively. RESULTS: The Fear of Falling Scale showed high internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and strong convergent and discriminant validity. There was a significant association between fear of falling score and the presence of both generalized anxiety disorder and major depression, poor balance-related motor ability, increased nonmotor symptoms of PD, more severe impairments in activities of daily living, and increased motor fluctuations. Finally, generalized anxiety disorder was a significant predictor of number of falls during a 12-month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: The Fear of Falling Scale is a valid and reliable instrument to assess fear of falling in PD. Fear of falling in PD is associated with specific psychiatric and motor disorders and is significantly related to the performance of balance-related motor functions. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

T1  - Fatigue in patients with vestibular schwannoma
LA  - eng
SN  - 0942-0940
Y1  - 2019/09/
ET  - 2019/07/18
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS) often complain about tiredness, exhaustion, lack of energy, and strength, but such symptoms of fatigue have scarcely been objectified and analyzed in a VS population. We aimed to characterize fatigue in a cohort of patients with VS and compare such symptoms with a control group. METHODS: All patients who attended an educational course for patients with VS were surveyed with validated tools for assessment of fatigue (fatigue severity scale), anxiety and depression (hospital anxiety and depression scale), sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness scale), and apathy (Starkstein apathy scale). Quality of Life was assessed with the disease-specific Penn Acoustic Neuroma Quality of Life (PANQOL). Symptom severity was estimated with a visual analog scale (VAS). The results have been compared to a control group consisting of patient companions. RESULTS: Data from 88 VS patients and 49 controls were analyzed. The controls had similar age and sex distribution as patients. Fifty-seven percent of VS patients had significant fatigue, compared to 25% in the control group. The mean fatigue score was 4.1 for the patients, and 2.8 for controls. Patients with fatigue were more likely to have depression, anxiety, sleepiness, and apathy. No correlation of fatigue was found with age, gender, or treatment modality. Regression analyses revealed depression, apathy, and vertigo to be predictors of fatigue. Fatigue was strongly correlated to QoL. CONCLUSION: Almost six out of ten VS patients had fatigue, significantly higher than the control group. Interest and focus on fatigue in VS patients can improve the patient's QoL.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence, natural history, and risk factors for impulse control behaviors (ICBs) among people with Parkinson disease (PD), those with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and controls. METHODS: Participants with early PD (within 3.5 years of diagnosis), those with RBD, and controls were clinically phenotyped and screened for ICBs longitudinally (with the Questionnaire for Impulsivity in Parkinson's Disease). ICB-positive individuals were invited for a semistructured interview, repeated 1 year later. The severity of the ICB was assessed with the Parkinson's Impulse Control Scale. Multiple imputation and regression models were used to estimate ICB prevalence and associations. RESULTS: Data from 921 cases of PD at baseline, 768 cases at 18 months, and 531 cases at 36 months were included, with 21% to 25% screening positive for ICBs at each visit. Interviews of ICB screen-positive individuals revealed that 10% met formal criteria for impulse control disorders (ICD), while 33% had subsyndromal ICD (ICB symptoms without reaching the formal diagnostic criteria for ICD). When these data were combined through the use of multiple imputation, the prevalence of PD-ICB was estimated at 19.1% (95% confidence interval 10.1-28.2). On follow-up, 24% of cases of subsyndromal ICD had developed full symptoms of an ICD. PD-ICD was associated with dopamine agonist use, motor complications, and apathy but not PD-RBD. ICD prevalence in the RBD group (1%) was similar to that in controls (0.7%). CONCLUSIONS: ICBs occur in 19.1% of patients with early PD, many persisting or worsening over time. RBD is not associated with increased ICD risk. Psychosocial drivers, including mood and support networks, affect severity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life in Parkinson's disease may be affected by a wide range of motor and non-motor symptoms. Identifying which symptoms are significant predictors of health-related quality of life in Parkinson's disease prioritizes symptoms for treatment, therapeutic development, and clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To determine predictors of health-related quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease. METHODS: We recruited 102 subjects into a prospective study to investigate neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Health-related quality of life was measured with the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire. Subjects completed the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Parts I-IV as well as validated scales to assess anxiety, depression, apathy, cognition, psychosis, impulsive-compulsive disorder, autonomic dysfunction, sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. We used univariate analyses to select clinical predictors to construct a multivariate regression model to determine which predictors were independently associated with worse health-related quality of life. RESULTS: In a multivariate linear regression model adjusted for age and gender, higher scores for the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part II as well more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, apathy, and excessive daytime sleepiness were associated with worse health-related quality of life. The model explained 78% of the variance of health-related quality of life, and the non-motor symptoms explained 49% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety, depression, excessive daytime sleepiness, apathy, and impairment in activities of daily living related to motor symptoms were independently associated with worse health-related quality of life.

T1  - Symptom prevalence and management in older adult patients in Lebanon
LA  - eng
SN  - 1478-9523
Y1  - 2019/08/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to explore symptoms and the effectiveness of their management in older adult palliative care candidates in Lebanon. The aims of this study were to: (1) determine symptom prevalence in Lebanese older adults who qualify for palliative care; (2) identify the severity and distress of symptoms; (3) identify the prevalence of symptom management and its efficacy; and (4) explore the relationship between overall symptom burden and its correlates. METHOD: This study uses an observational cross-sectional design using convenience sampling (N = 203) to recruit older adults qualifying for palliative care from three major medical centers in Lebanon. RESULT: The mean age of the sample was 78.61 years. The most prevalent symptoms were lack of energy (93.5%), worrying (83.2%), and pain (71.4%). Psychological symptoms had the highest mean scores, preceded only by the physical symptoms and lack of energy. The most treated symptoms were physical with pain having the highest treatment prevalence (91%). Although psychological symptoms were the most burdensome, they were poorly treated. Multiple regression analysis showed that symptom scores had significant positive associations with financial status, social functioning, and comorbidities; there was a negative association with age. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Lack of energy and psychological symptoms were the most prevalent, with the latter having the highest mean total symptom scores. Treatment was poor for psychological symptoms and effective for physical ones. Associations were found between age, comorbidity, financial problems, social functioning, and total physical and psychological mean symptom burden scores. More attention needs to be given to psychological symptoms and their management among older adults receiving palliative care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is prominent in persons with dementia and apathy assessment is challenging. It remains unclear who should conduct apathy assessments in long-term care settings for residents with moderate to advanced dementia. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is a widely used instrument and its use for long-term care residents with dementia needs to be further established. This study explored the relationship among apathy assessments conducted by family and clinical caregivers using the original AES (AES-18) and the nursing home version (AES-10). METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive design and enrolled 15 quartets of participants recruited from long-term care settings. Each quartet consisted of one resident with dementia, one family member, one certified nursing assistant (CNA), and one licensed practical nurse (LPN) or activity staff. Family, CNAs, and LPNs/activity staff rated the resident’s apathy level on the AES independently. Bivariate Pearson correlation coefficients were used for analysis. RESULTS: The results revealed that ratings conducted by CNAs and LPNs/activity staff were moderately correlated for the AES-18 and the result approached statistical significance (r=0.47, p= .08). None of the other AES ratings among family, CNAs, and LPNs/activity staff were significantly correlated. DISCUSSION: Family and clinical caregivers were incongruent on their AES ratings of apathy. It remains undetermined which rater provides the most valid AES rating for residents with dementia. Findings from this study further highlight challenges in rating apathy in this population. Future research is needed to determine best practices for accurate apathy assessment for residents with dementia in long-term care.

T1  - Brief Psychiatric Screening Questionnaire in Parkinson's Disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 2090-8083
SN  - 2042-0080
Y1  - 2019/07/24
AB  - BACKGROUND: While numerous validated questionnaires measuring psychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are available, a quick multifaceted screening tool is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To generate the Brief Psychiatric Questionnaire (BPQ) that quickly screens for depression, anxiety, and apathy and to evaluate its content validity against three reference scales. METHODS: Forty-seven questions were drafted and measured against the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (Form Y2) (STAI-Y2), and Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). Data were reduced by principal component analysis and linear regression. Content validity and repeatability were assessed in a second cohort. RESULTS: Data from ninety-five patients were used for BPQ development. Variation explained by the final linear regression models was 52% for GDS (R (2) = 0.521, F(2,94) = 49.97, p < 0.0001), 65% for STAI-Y2 (R (2) = 0.652, F(4,94) = 42.08, p < 0.0001), and 14% for AES (R (2) = 0.135, F(1,94) = 14.51, p < 0.0001). From the initial pool, only five questions remained for further testing. BPQ questions correctly identified 88% in the second cohort of 33 patients scoring more than five on GDS and 91% who scored in the highest decile of STAI-Y2, but only 51% who scored in the highest decile of AES. Moderate to strong correlation (r = 0.464 - 0.733, p < 0.004) between predicted scores based on BPQ questions and actual scores of three validated questionnaires was demonstrated. Good repeatability of BPQ questions was demonstrated by moderate to high intraclass correlation coefficients (0.47-0.772, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: BPQ questions were able to accurately identify patients at risk of depression and anxiety but not apathy. It is brief and multifaceted and can act as a preconsultation tool to prompt further psychiatric assessment.

T1  - Assessing anxiety and its correlates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: The state-trait anxiety inventory
LA  - eng
SN  - 1097-4598
Y1  - 2019/07/
ET  - 2019/04/02
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We evaluated: (1) psychometric properties of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y (STAI Form Y); (2) clinical correlates of state and trait anxiety; (3) associations of anxiety with quality of life (QoL) dimensions. METHODS: We assessed 159 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) on STAI Form Y and on tests and questionnaires for depression, apathy, QoL, and cognitive abilities. RESULTS: Clinically diagnosed anxiety (by Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inventory) occurred in 30 (19%) patients. STAI Form Y fitted a 2-factor structure and showed good psychometric properties. State and trait anxiety were weakly associated with female sex, bulbar functional decay, and cognitive decline in language and memory; trait anxiety was associated with lower educational attainment and poorer scores on visuospatial tasks. State and trait anxiety were associated with poorer physical and psychosocial QoL dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety is tightly associated with QoL in ALS, and can be reliably assessed by STAI Form Y.

T1  - Can we predict amyloid deposition by objective cognition and regional cerebral blood flow in patients with subjective cognitive decline?
LA  - eng
SN  - 1479-8301
Y1  - 2019/07/
ET  - 2019/01/27
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may herald the first symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) whereas individuals with beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition are regarded as a high-risk group for AD. Recently, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) studies have demonstrated clinical and cognitive feature differences between Aβ-positive and negative SCD, but details of their differences remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the relationships among Aβ deposition, clinical, and cognitive features in patients with SCD. METHODS: Forty-two patients with SCD (22 women, 74.5 ± 4.7 years) were examined using fluorine-18 florbetaben PET and were divided into Aβ-positive (n = 10) and negative (n = 32) groups. We compared cognitive and psychological outcomes, and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging data between the two groups. In addition, a linear regression analysis was performed to assess relationships between the severity of SCD and neuropsychological tests, affective scores, and demographic factors. RESULTS: The rate of score changes from the immediate recall to delayed recall in the logical memory subtest of the Wechsler's Memory Scale Revised were different between the groups (P = 0.04). However, the binary logistic regression analysis showed no significant differences between the two. In addition, the severity of SCD was significantly strong in women (P = 0.002). Furthermore, within the Aβ-negative group, subjective memory loss correlated with word fluency category score (P = 0.023) and apathy scale (P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were observed between Aβ-positive and -negative SCD on any of the neuropsychological measures, clinical measures, or SPECT imaging. Further, the severity of SCD was not predicted by the symptoms of anxiety, depression, or neuropsychological examination.

AB  - Objective Depression is common in patients with heart failure (HF) and is a possible risk factor for adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of depression assessed by the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and the effect of depression on outcomes in Japanese outpatients with HF. Methods This sub-analysis of a prospective observational study assessed 976 patients with HF (mean age 66±13 years; 26.7% female; 42.7% with an ischemic etiology). Depression was defined as a PHQ-2 score ≥3. The main composite outcome was death from any cause or hospitalization due to worsening HF. PHQ-2 items were extracted from the PHQ-9 results. To evaluate the association of PHQ-2 scores with outcomes, Cox proportional hazards models were evaluated. Results Fifty-seven (5.8%) patients were diagnosed with depression. During a median follow-up of 21 months, the incidence rates for death from any cause and hospitalization due to worsening HF in patients with and without depression were 2.2 vs. 0.9 per 100 person-years and 6.7 vs. 1.6, p<0.001, respectively. There was a higher incidence of the main outcome in patients with depression than in those without depression (p<0.001). After adjustment for conventional risk factors, depression (PHQ-2 ≥3) was an independent predictor of the main outcome (hazard ratio 2.41, 95% confidence interval 1.14-4.67, p=0.022), and a score for item 1 of the PHQ-2 (loss of interest or pleasure) ≥2 was also an independent risk factor (hazard ratio 3.57, 95% confidence interval 1.85-6.46, p<0.001). Conclusion Depression as assessed by the PHQ-2 was identified in 5.8% of Japanese outpatients with HF and was associated with outcomes.

T1  - Validity of a novel screen for cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms in cardiac rehabilitation
LA  - eng
SN  - 1471-2318
Y1  - 2019/06/11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no composite screening tool that can efficiently and effectively assess prevalent yet under-recognized cognitive and neuropsychiatric comorbidities in patients with cardiovascular disease. We aimed to determine the validity and feasibility of a novel screen assessing cognitive impairment, anxiety, apathy and depression (CAAD screen) in those attending cardiac rehabilitation (CR). METHODS: All patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors entering CR were screened as part of clinical care. A subset of those patients agreed to complete validation assessments (n = 127). Screen results were compared to widely accepted standards for cognition, anxiety, apathy, and depression using a modified receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve analysis. RESULTS: The screen was completed by 97% of participants in 10 min or less with an average completion time of approximately 5 min. Screening scores adjusted for age, sex and years of education had acceptable or excellent validity compared to widely accepted standard diagnoses: CAAD-Cog (AUC = 0.80); CAAD-Anx (AUC = 0.81); CAAD-Apathy (AUC = 0.79) and CAAD-Dep (AUC = 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: The CAAD screen may be a valid and feasible tool for detecting cognitive impairment, anxiety, apathy and depression in CR settings.

T1  - Assessing cognition and daily function in early dementia using the cognitive-functional composite: findings from the Catch-Cog study cohort
LA  - eng
SN  - 1758-9193
Y1  - 2019/05/15
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cognitive-functional composite (CFC) was designed to improve the measurement of clinically relevant changes in predementia and early dementia stages. We have previously demonstrated its good test-retest reliability and feasibility of use. The current study aimed to evaluate several quality aspects of the CFC, including construct validity, clinical relevance, and suitability for the target population. METHODS: Baseline data of the Capturing Changes in Cognition study was used: an international, prospective cohort study including participants with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The CFC comprises seven existing cognitive tests focusing on memory and executive functions (EF) and the informant-based Amsterdam Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q). Construct validity and clinical relevance were assessed by (1) confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) using all CFC subtests and (2) linear regression analyses relating the CFC score (independent) to reference measures of disease severity (dependent), correcting for age, sex, and education. To assess the suitability for the target population, we compared score distributions of the CFC to those of traditional tests (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale, and Clinical Dementia Rating scale). RESULTS: A total of 184 participants were included (age 71.8 ± 8.4; 42% female; n = 14 SCD, n = 80 MCI, n = 78 AD, and n = 12 DLB). CFA showed that the hypothesized three-factor model (memory, EF, and IADL) had adequate fit (CFI = .931, RMSEA = .091, SRMR = .06). Moreover, worse CFC performance was associated with more cognitive decline as reported by the informant (β = .61, p < .001), poorer quality of life (β = .51, p < .001), higher caregiver burden (β = - .51, p < .001), more apathy (β = - .36, p < .001), and less cortical volume (β = .34, p = .02). Whilst correlations between the CFC and traditional measures were moderate to strong (ranging from - .65 to .83, all p < .001), histograms showed floor and ceiling effects for the traditional tests as compared to the CFC. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate that the CFC has good construct validity, captures clinically relevant aspects of disease severity, and shows no range restrictions in scoring. It therefore provides a more useful outcome measure than traditional tests to evaluate cognition and function in MCI and mild AD.

T1  - Pilot study to develop and validate a questionnaire based on HIV symptoms index
TT  - Estudio piloto para desarrollar y validar un cuestionario basado en el índice de síntomas de VIH
LA  - eng
SN  - 2171-8695

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary endpoint is to validate the HIV Symptoms Index Questionnaire in a Spanish  population, in terms of comprehension and acceptability. The secondary endpoints are to describe  symptoms reported by patients, tolerance, and quality of life. METHOD: The pilot trial of an observational and multicenter non-comparative study, for the validation  of the HIV Symptoms Index Questionnaire in a Spanish population. Patients over the age of 18  diagnosed with HIV infection and receiving treatment were included. The symptoms index, treatment  adherence based on pharmacy dispensing records, and quality of life with MOS-HIV questionnaire  were calculated. Statistical analyses were conducted with the SAP System V9.2. RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2014, the HIV Symptoms Index Questionnaire was applied to 75  patients; 95% of these patients considered the questionnaire was easy to apply and understand. The  total median score of the questionnaire was nine symptoms (IQR 1-18); and the most frequent symptoms were nerves or anxiety (45%), stomach swelling, pain or gas (40%), sleep  problems (39%), and fatigue or lack of energy (37%). Presence of symptoms was associated with a  worse outcome in the MOS-HIV questionnaire. According to the Visual Analogue Scale, the higher the  score in the questionnaire, the lower the tolerance level (R = -0.51; p &lt; 0.0001), and the higher  number of days with symptoms (R = 0.51; p &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The questionnaire was easy to apply. A high tolerance level was confirmed, as well as a  consistent and significant correlation with the MOS-HIV and the Visual Analogue Scale.

T1  - Association Between CSF Beta-Amyloid and Apathy in Early-Stage Alzheimer Disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1552-5708
Y1  - 2019/05/
ET  - 2019/03/26
AB  - AIM: The apathetic syndrome is a common clinical feature in patients with Alzheimer diseases (AD), from preclinical phases to late stages of dementia, and it is strongly related to major disease outcomes. Unfortunately, no specific pharmacological treatments for apathy have been accomplished so far. Translational evidences have previously shown that a link between apathy and hallmarks of AD-related pathophysiology, that is, β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, exists. However, only few studies investigated the association between core biomarkers of AD and apathy scores, finding conflicting results. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients were identified as having AD dementia according to National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer Association 2011 criteria. All participants underwent an extensive diagnostic workup including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assessment to measure the concentrations of Aβ(42), t-tau, and pTau(181.) To follow, they were stratified as: apathy absence, apathy mild, and apathy severe according to the Neuro Psychiatric Inventory-apathy item scores. We investigated for potential associations between apathy scores and CSF biomarkers concentrations as well as for differences in terms of clinical and CSF biomarkers data across the 3 apathy groups. RESULTS: The CSF Aβ(42) concentrations were negatively correlated with apathy scores. In addition, patients with severe apathy had significantly lower Aβ(42) levels compared to nonapathetic ones. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, we encourage further studies to untangle the potential association between the complex pathophysiological dynamics of AD and apathy which may represent an innovative reliable clinical outcome measure to use in clinical trials, investigating treatments with either a symptomatic or a disease-modifying effect.

T1  - Social inhibition in population-based and cardiac patient samples: Robustness of inhibition, sensitivity and withdrawal as distinct facets
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-7714
Y1  - 2019///May-Jun
ET  - 2019/02/17
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Behavioral inhibition plays a key role in animal stress research and developmental research in children. Therefore, we examined the robustness of our multifaceted model of adult social inhibition that comprises behavioral inhibition, interpersonal sensitivity, and social withdrawal components. METHOD: A total of 899 adults completed the 15-item Social Inhibition Questionnaire (SIQ15) and measures of emotional distress. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), reliability estimates, and correlational and second-order factor analyses were used to examine the robustness of our model. RESULTS: CFA (RMSEA = 0.052; NFI = 0.938; CFI = 0.957) and Cronbach's α estimates ≥0.87 confirmed the robustness of our multi-facet social inhibition model based on three correlated inhibition, sensitivity, and withdrawal factors in 560 adults from the general population and in 194 undergraduate students. Inhibition, sensitivity, and withdrawal were stable over time (3-month test-retest correlations ≥ 0.78), and were closely related to the Gest Behavioral Inhibition and PID-5 Withdrawal measures in a clinical sample of 145 cardiac patients. Of note, male cardiac patients reported more inhibition and withdrawal than female patients. Across samples, social inhibition was distinctly different from negative affectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our 3-facet model of inhibition, sensitivity and withdrawal was robust across samples, and may promote research on adult social inhibition in population-based and clinical studies.

T1  - The Influence of Stroke Location on Cognitive and Mood Impairment. A Voxel-Based Lesion-Symptom Mapping Study
LA  - eng

ET  - 2019/02/02
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The role of stroke location as a determinant of mood and cognitive symptoms is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to identify the predictive value of ischemic stroke location, on a voxel basis, for mood and cognitive outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective monocentric study including patients with a supratentorial ischemic stroke was conducted. A 3 Tesla brain MRI was performed at baseline. Mood and cognition were assessed using Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD), apathy inventory (AI), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale subscores, performed at 3 months poststroke. Statistical maps of ischemic stroke location associated with 3 months mood and cognitive scores were obtained using a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping approach (Brunner and Munzel test). Significant voxels (false discovery rate [FDR] corrected-P < .01) were identified using the standard Montreal Neurological Institute-152 space template. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-five nonsevere stroke patients were included (64% men, mean age 66 ± 14, median National Institute of Health Stroke Score 3, interquartile range 2-6). Ischemic stroke location was not associated with HAD or AI scores. Language, abstraction, and delayed recall performances were mainly associated with left-side hemispheric lesions. Lesions in both hemispheres were associated with lower performances in visuospatial and executive functions, naming, attention, and orientation. CONCLUSION: Ischemic stroke location does not predict mood outcome at 3 months but is a determinant of cognitive outcome in specific domains.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of apathy, impulsivity, and behavioral change on survival in patients with frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal syndrome. METHODS: We assessed 124 patients from the epidemiologic PiPPIN (Pick's Disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Prevalence and Incidence) study. Patients underwent detailed baseline cognitive and behavioral assessment focusing on apathy, impulsivity, and behavioral change. Logistic regression identified predictors of death within 2.5 years from assessment, including age, sex, diagnosis, cognition, and 8 neurobehavioral profiles derived from a principal component analysis of neuropsychological and behavioral measures. RESULTS: An apathetic neurobehavioral profile predicted death (Wald statistic = 8.119, p = 0.004, Exp(B) = 2.912, confidence interval = >1 [1.396-6.075]) and was elevated in all patient groups. This profile represented apathy, weighted strongly to carer reports from the Apathy Evaluation Scale, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and Cambridge Behavioral Inventory. Age at assessment, sex, and global cognitive impairment were not significant predictors. Differences in mortality risk across diagnostic groups were accounted for by their neuropsychiatric and behavioral features. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between apathy and survival highlights the need to develop more effective and targeted measurement tools to improve its recognition and facilitate treatment. The prognostic importance of apathy suggests that neurobehavioral features might be useful to predict survival and stratify patients for interventional trials. Effective symptomatic interventions targeting the neurobiology of apathy might ultimately also improve prognosis.

AB  - AIM: Low motivation is a core symptom of schizophrenia which significantly impacts successful engagement in and benefit from psychosocial treatments. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to design psychosocial treatments to effectively motivate and engage patients during the treatment. The MUSIC® Model of Academic Motivation Inventory (MMI) is an 18-item instrument with five scales that assess students' motivation during academic tasks. The objective of the current study was to validate the MMI for use with schizophrenia-spectrum patients undergoing cognitive training. METHODS: Participants included 181 people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders enrolled in cognitive training in four countries. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) assessed construct validity. Quality of fit was determined using the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR), and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). Pearson's correlation coefficients assessed construct validity and Cronbach's alphas assessed reliability. Furthermore, we examined factor loadings for each inventory item and assessed predictive validity by analyzing MMI scales with attendance outcomes. RESULTS: Consistent with the original MMI validation studies used in academic settings, we found CFI values indicated a good fit, as did the SRMR and RMSEA values. The scales were correlated yet distinct. Cronbach's alpha values ranged from good to excellent and factor loadings showed that all items loaded very well onto their intended factors. The MMI had a positive relationship to treatment intensity. CONCLUSION: The MMI is a valid and reliable tool to use with individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders undergoing a cognitive training intervention.

T1  - Cortical correlates of behavioural change in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
LA  - eng
SN  - 1468-330X
Y1  - 2019/04/
ET  - 2018/10/15
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioural changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are heterogeneous. The study aim was to identify the behavioural profiles of non-demented patients with ALS and their neuroimaging correlates and to elucidate if they are comparable to those reported in studies of the behavioural-variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). METHODS: Behavioural changes of 102 non-demented patients with ALS were assessed through the Frontal Behavioural Inventory (FBI), a 24-item scale assessing different behavioural modifications, mainly chosen from the core clinical features of FTD. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to detect distinct clusters of behavioural changes based on FBI subscores. The cortical thinning related to each behavioural profile was analysed in 29 patients with ALS. Cronbach's α was used to test the reliability of bvFTD-related FBI clustering in our cohort. RESULTS: Sixty patients with ALS had FBI score≥1. PCA identified three phenotypic clusters loading on disinhibited/hostile, dysexecutive and apathetic FBI subscores. Imaging analyses revealed that the thinning of bilateral orbitofrontal cortex was related to apathy, the right frontotemporal and cingular cortex to the disinhibited/hostile profile and the left precuneus cortex to the dysexecutive behaviours. The bvFTD-associated aggressive profile reliably applied to our cohort. CONCLUSIONS: In non-demented patients with ALS, different behavioural profiles could be identified. The right frontotemporal and cingular cortex thinning was the hallmark of the behavioural profile mostly overlapping that described in bvFTD. Our findings provide the unbiased identification of determinants relevant for a novel stratification of patients with ALS based on their behavioural impairment, which might be useful as proxy of cognitive decline.

T1  - The Suicidal Narrative and Its Relationship to the Suicide Crisis Syndrome and Recent Suicidal Behavior
LA  - eng
SN  - 1943-278X
Y1  - 2019/04/
ET  - 2018/02/04
AB  - In this study, we introduce the construct of the suicidal narrative, a hypothetical personal narrative linked to imminent suicide, and explore its relationship to near-term suicidal risk and the suicide crisis syndrome (SCS). Psychiatric outpatients (N = 289) were administered the Columbia Suicide-Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), Suicide Crisis Inventory (SCI), and Suicide Narrative Inventory (SNI), a novel instrument combining the documented risk factors of Thwarted Belongingness, Perceived Burdensomeness, Humiliation, Social Defeat, Goal Disengagement, and Goal Reengagement. Dimensional measures of past month, lifetime, and past suicidal phenomena, incorporating ideation and behavior, were calculated from the C-SSRS. Structural equation modeling was used to explore the interaction among variables. Factor analysis of the SNI yielded two orthogonal factors, termed Interpersonal and Goal Orientation. The former factor was comprised of Perceived Burdensomeness, Social Defeat, Humiliation, and Thwarted Belongingness, the latter of Goal Disengagement and Goal Reengagement. The Interpersonal factor correlated with both SCS severity and suicidal phenomena in each time frame and the Goal Orientation factor with no other variable. As hypothesized, the proposed model was significant for the past month only. Our findings support the construct of the suicidal narrative and its function as a near-term suicidal risk factor.

T1  - Barriers and Facilitators of Colorectal Cancer Screening in a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC)
LA  - eng
SN  - 1558-7118
Y1  - 2019///Mar-Apr
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Current screening recommendations for individuals aged 50 to 75 years include colonoscopy every 10 years, flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or annual stool-based testing. Stool-based testing, including fecal immunochemical tests (FITs), are cost effective, easy to perform at home, and noninvasive, yet many patients fail to return testing kits and go unscreened. The purpose of the study was to identify patient characteristics and perceived barriers and facilitators of FIT return. METHODS: Patients in a large, federally qualified health center who received a FIT kit order between January 1 and July 1, 2017 were identified. We compared sociodemographic and health characteristics between patients who returned and did not return FITs. We used telephone surveys to nonreturners to identify potential barriers (cost, knowledge, psychosocial factors) and facilitators (prepaid postage, outreach) of FIT kit return. An online survey of clinicians assessed perceived patient barriers and facilitators of colorectal cancer screening. RESULTS: Of the 875 patients who received a FIT order, 435 (49.7%) did not return the kit and 121 of the nonreturners completed a telephone survey. Current smokers had an increased risk of FIT nonreturn compared with never smokers (RR = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.13-1.54). Forgetfulness and lack of motivation were the most common FIT return barriers perceived by both patients and clinicians. Prepaid postage with return address on FIT return envelopes and live call reminders were the most commonly reported facilitators. Barriers and facilitators varied greatest between English- and Spanish-speaking patients. CONCLUSION: In this study, the most common perceived barriers to return of screening fecal test kits were forgetfulness and lack of motivation. The most common perceived facilitators were live call reminders and postage-paid return envelopes. Understanding barriers and facilitators to FITs may be necessary to enhance cancer screening rates in underserved patient populations.

T1  - Quality of life in men living with advanced and localised prostate cancer in the UK: a population-based study
LA  - eng

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of men living with advanced prostate cancer. We report population-wide functional outcomes and HRQOL in men with all stages of prostate cancer and identify implications for health-care delivery. METHODS: For this population-based study, men in the UK living 18-42 months after diagnosis of prostate cancer were identified through cancer registration data. A postal survey was administered, which contained validated measures to assess functional outcomes (urinary incontinence, urinary irritation and obstruction, bowel, sexual, and vitality and hormonal function), measured with the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite short form (EPIC-26), plus questions about use of interventions for sexual dysfunction) and generic HRQOL (assessed with the 5-level EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire [EQ-5D-5L] measuring mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression, plus a rating of self-assessed health). Log-linear and binary logistic regression models were used to compare functional outcomes and HRQOL across diagnostic stages and self-reported treatment groups. Each model included adjustment for age, socioeconomic deprivation, and number of other long-term conditions. FINDINGS: 35 823 (60·8%) of 58 930 men responded to the survey. Disease stage was known for 30 733 (85·8%) of 35 823 men; 19 599 (63·8%) had stage I or II, 7209 (23·4%) stage III, and 3925 (12·8%) stage IV disease. Mean adjusted EPIC-26 domain scores were high, indicating good function, except for sexual function, for which scores were much lower. Compared with men who did not receive androgen deprivation therapy, more men who received the therapy reported moderate to big problems with hot flushes (30·7% [95% CI 29·8-31·6] vs 5·4% [5·0-5·8]), low energy (29·4% [95% CI 28·6-30·3] vs 14·7% [14·2-15·3]), and weight gain (22·5%, 21·7-23·3) vs 6·9% [6·5-7·3]). Poor sexual function was common (81·0%; 95% CI 80·6-81·5), regardless of stage, and more than half of men (n=18 782 [55·8%]) were not offered any intervention to help with this condition. Overall, self-assessed health was similar in men with stage I-III disease, and although slightly reduced in those with stage IV cancer, 23·5% of men with metastatic disease reported no problems on any EQ-5D dimension. INTERPRETATION: Men diagnosed with advanced disease do not report substantially different HRQOL outcomes to those diagnosed with localised disease, although considerable problems with hormonal function and fatigue are reported in men treated with androgen deprivation therapy. Sexual dysfunction is common and most men are not offered helpful intervention or support. Service improvements around sexual rehabilitation and measures to reduce the effects of androgen deprivation therapy are required. FUNDING: The Movember Foundation, in partnership with Prostate Cancer UK.

T1  - Clinical and demographic correlates of apathy in Parkinson's disease

ET  - 2019/01/02
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To better understand the demographic, neuropsychiatric, cognitive, and motor predictors of apathy in Parkinson's disease (PD). METHOD: 112 participants (M(age) = 68.53 years; M(disease duration) = 6.17 years) were administered the Apathy Scale (AS), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), Trail Making Test (TMT), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV Matrix Reasoning subtest, letter (F-A-S) and category (Animals) fluency, and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised. Psychosis was assessed. A stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the ability of demographic factors and clinical assessments to predict nonapathetic (AS ≤ 13) versus apathetic (AS > 13) group membership. RESULTS: The regression analysis yielded a robust model in which older age, less education, elevated BDI-II, current psychosis, higher MDS-UPDRS Part III (motor score), and slower TMT-B performance predicted membership in the apathetic group, with a correct classification rate of 77.5% (Nagelkerke R(2) = 0.48, p < .001). Depression (OR = 9.20, p < .001) and education (OR = 0.66, p = 0.002) contributed significantly to the overall model. A linear regression with AS score as the outcome variable was similar, but TMT-B additionally contributed significantly (p = 0.02) to the overall model, F(6, 86) = 12.02, p < .001, adjusted R(2) = 0.42. CONCLUSIONS: Of the factors examined, depression, education, and executive functioning were the strongest correlates of apathy in PD. These results support the idea that common underlying frontosubcortical disruptions in this population contribute to apathy, depression, and executive dysfunction.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to validate the Apathy Evaluation Scale, self-rated version (AES-S), and assess the severity of apathy in a cognitively healthy middle-aged cohort at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHOD: Three hundred and sixteen middle-aged adults were selected to represent a subset of the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Clinical Core: the Investigating Memory in People At-risk, Causes and Treatments cohort. RESULTS: An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with varimax rotation identified 3 subscales: apathy, disinterest, and social withdrawal factors. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the EFA findings. Results indicated acceptable convergent and discriminant validity. The AES-S is a reliable instrument to quantify apathy in cognitively healthy middle-aged individuals at risk for AD. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the AES-S is a psychometrically sound measurement tool for assessing levels of apathy in a cognitively healthy middle-aged cohort at risk for AD.

AB  - AIMS: Nonadherence is one of the leading challenges to treatment of the major depressive disorder (MDD). Few studies have systematically analyzed the relationship between clinical characteristics, especially symptoms of depressive patients and their therapeutic nonadherence over a relatively large sample. This study aimed to investigate factors of nonadherence in a nationwide survey in China. METHODS: Participants with MDD who met the criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV) were recruited from 32 sites throughout China. Patients were all over 16 years old. A doctor-rating questionnaire with 64 symptoms based on DSM-IV was constructed to evaluate depression-related feeling and behavior. Single-factor logistic regression was utilized to screen variables, and multifactor logistic regressive analysis was used to identify which factors were risk or protective for nonadherence. We included 882 patients of poor adherence and 857 patients of good adherence. RESULTS: Recurrence, untreated first episode, tricyclic antidepressant (TCA)-treated first episode, antidepressant-only-treated current episode, decrease or loss of interest, more somatic symptoms, and "atypical" symptoms were risk factors for nonadherence, whereas selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)-treated first episode was a protecting factor. CONCLUSION: Clinical characteristics may play an important role in predicting nonadherence. Doctors may have to pay much attention on patients with these factors and should keep on discussing them with patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The concept of symptomatic and functional remission represents an important challenge in the care of the mentally ill, particularly in patients with schizophrenia. Operational criteria for symptomatic remission in schizophrenia have been proposed by Andreasen et al. (2005). Over the last decade, these criteria have been widely validated; however few studies have been conducted outside developed countries. Moreover, the association of symptomatic remission with functional outcome has not yet been established in developing countries including Tunisia, as there may be variability in the social and familial environment. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency and associated factors of symptomatic remission in a sample of Tunisian out-patients with schizophrenia and to explore the relationship between symptomatic remission and some indicators of social functioning. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried-out on 115 out-patients with schizophrenia (87 males, 28 females, mean age=37.56±10.2 years) in the psychiatry department of the university hospital in Monastir (Tunisia). Nearly all of the patients (98.26%) had been hospitalized at least once in a psychiatric unit. The last hospitalization dated back to 39 months on average (range=6 months to 16 years). Symptomatic remission was assessed by the eight core items of the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). These are the items P1 "Delusions"; P3 "Hallucinatory behavior" and G9 "Unusual thought content" for the positive dimension, the items P2 "Conceptual disorganization" and G5 "Mannerism and disorders of posture" for the disorganization dimension and the items N1 "Blunted affect", N4 "Social withdrawal" and N6 "Lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation" for the negative dimension. A score of mild or less on all eight-core symptoms constitutes symptomatic remission. This symptom level should have been maintained for six months. The social functioning was assessed by the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) and the Social Autonomy Scale (SAS) exploring personal care, management of daily life, resource management, the relationship with the outside and the emotional life and relationships social. A multivariate analysis using a binary logistic regression was conducted with as a dependent variable "symptomatic remission" and as explanatory variables the associated variables with symptomatic remission in bivariate analysis with age and gender. RESULTS: The symptomatic remission was observed in 50.4% of patients. The items corresponding to positive dimension (P1, P3 and G9) and the item P2 "conceptual disorganization" had a better predictive value of symptomatic remission. After multivariate analysis, the associated factors of symptomatic remission were the acute of onset (P=0.026), the low score of negative symptoms during the last hospitalization (P=0.017) and the episodic course (P<0.0001). However, age or gender of the patients, educational or socioeconomic level, psychiatric family history, age of onset, duration of untreated psychosis, number and duration of previous hospitalizations, antipsychotic treatment dosage were not associated with symptomatic remission in our sample. The mean score of the SOFAS was 48.47±14.44, and the mean score of the SAS was 56.6±16.84. A significant association was shown between the SOFAS score and the symptomatic remission (P<0.0001) and between the SAS score and the symptomatic remission (P<0.0001). Moreover, a significant association was found between symptomatic remission and occupational activity (P=0.03). CONCLUSION: The frequency of symptomatic remission according the PANSS criteria in our sample is above the average of the reported rates in literature (30 to 60%). This can be explained by the frequency of symptomatic remission in outpatient versus inpatients, or in relation to the notion of a more favorable course of schizophrenia in developing countries, although this notion is controversial. Remitter patients had significantly an acute onset of disorders, a low score of negative symptoms during the last hospitalization and an episodic course. They also showed a significant trend for better social functioning. In fact, a significant association was shown in our sample between symptomatic remission and social functioning. These results suggest that the concept of remission has important implications for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia.

T1  - Relationship of Physical Frailty to Phosphocreatine Recovery in Muscle after Mild Exercise Stress in the Oldest-Old Women
LA  - eng
SN  - 2260-1341
SN  - 2273-4309
Y1  - 2019
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical frailty is a clinical syndrome associated with aging and manifesting as slowness, weakness, reduced physical activity, weight loss, and/or exhaustion. Frail older adults often report that their major problem is "low energy", and there is indirect evidence to support the hypothesis that frailty is a syndrome of dysregulated energetics. We hypothesized that altered cellular energy production underlies compromised response to stressors in the frail. METHODS: We conducted a pilot study to assess muscle energetics in response to a mild isometric exercise challenge in women (n=30) ages 84-93 years. The frailty status was assessed by a validated physical frailty instrument. Localized phosphorus (P31) magnetic resonance spectroscopy with a 1.5T magnet was used to assess the kinetics of Phosphocreatine recovery in the tibialis anterior muscle following maximal isometric contraction for 30 seconds. RESULTS: Phosphocreatine recovery following exertion, age-adjusted, was slowest in the frail group (mean=189 sec; 95%CI: 150,228) compared to pre-frail (mean=152 sec; 95%CI: 107,197) and nonfrail subjects (mean=132 sec; 95%CI: 40,224). The pre-frail and frail groups had 20 sec (95%CI: -49,89) and 57 sec (95%CI: -31,147) slower phosphocreatine recovery, respectively, than the non-frail. This response was paralleled by dysregulation in glucose recovery in response to oral glucose tolerance test in women from the same study population. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired muscle energetics and energy metabolism might be implicated in the physical frailty syndrome.

T1  - Screening Properties of the Diagnostic Criteria for Cancer-Related Fatigue
LA  - eng
SN  - 2296-5262
Y1  - 2019
ET  - 2019/07/23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Within the theoretical framework of the ICD diagnostic criteria of cancer-related fatigue, we aim to investigate how those criteria can be used for screening purposes. METHODS: Fatigue was assessed in a mixed sample of 1,225 cancer patients during their stay in a rehabilitation clinic using four different fatigue measures and the diagnostic criteria (Criterion A; DC-A). Psychometric evaluations (e.g., acceptance, reliability, validity, item analyses) were conducted for the sum score and for all items of the diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: A total of 678 (57.1%) patients tested positive according to the DC-A. The sum score of the DC-A had good reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87) and validity, corresponded closely with other fatigue scales, and, with less than 1% missing values, showed a high degree of patients' acceptance. The highest accuracy (approx. 0.80) and Youden indices (>0.55) were found for the items "Difficulties completing daily tasks" (A9), "Struggle to overcome inactivity" (A7), "Decreased motivation or interests" (A4), and "Unrefreshing sleep" (A6). CONCLUSION: The DC-A proved to be a well-accepted, easy to use, and reliable tool for measuring the severity of fatigue. In this paper, we make suggestions for the use of single items of the DC-A as a short and economical screening tool.

T1  - Does Personality Predict Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia? Results from PACO Prospective Study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-8908
Y1  - 2019
AB  - BACKGROUND: Premorbid personality could play a role in the onset of behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPS) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but prospective studies are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed at prospectively assessing the influence of premorbid personality traits on BPS evolution in a population of patients with prodromal or mild AD. METHODS: We used a multicenter prospective cohort study of 237 patients followed-up for 18 months. The influence of personality traits on BPS evolution, measured with Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), was assessed using linear mixed-effect models. RESULTS: A principal components analysis of the 12 NPI behavioral domains yielded five factors labelled as psychotic symptoms, affective symptoms, behavioral dyscontrol, apathy/appetite symptoms, and sleep disorders. During the follow-up, higher neuroticism was significantly associated with a higher progression of affective symptoms (p < 0.0001), apathy/appetite symptoms (p = 0.002), sleep disorders (p = 0.001) as well as global NPI scores (p < 0.0001). Greater conscientiousness was related to a lower evolution of psychotic (p = 0.002), affective (p = 0.02) and apathy/appetite symptoms (p = 0.02), and global NPI score (p < 0.0001). Higher openness was associated with lower affective symptoms evolution (p = 0.01). A significant relationship was found between higher extraversion, lower affective symptoms (p = 0.02), and higher behavioral dyscontrol (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The present analysis suggests that premorbid personality may influence the evolution of BPS in prodromal or mild AD. Given these results, it seems important to give more importance to personality assessment in early AD, in order to better identify and manage patients at risk of adverse behavioral changes.

T1  - Detecting Apathy in Older Adults with Cognitive Disorders Using Automatic Speech Analysis
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-8908
Y1  - 2019
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is present in several psychiatric and neurological conditions and has been found to have a severe negative effect on disease progression. In older people, it can be a predictor of increased dementia risk. Current assessment methods lack objectivity and sensitivity, thus new diagnostic tools and broad-scale screening technologies are needed. OBJECTIVE: This study is the first of its kind aiming to investigate whether automatic speech analysis could be used for characterization and detection of apathy. METHODS: A group of apathetic and non-apathetic patients (n = 60) with mild to moderate neurocognitive disorder were recorded while performing two short narrative speech tasks. Paralinguistic markers relating to prosodic, formant, source, and temporal qualities of speech were automatically extracted, examined between the groups and compared to baseline assessments. Machine learning experiments were carried out to validate the diagnostic power of extracted markers. RESULTS: Correlations between apathy sub-scales and features revealed a relation between temporal aspects of speech and the subdomains of reduction in interest and initiative, as well as between prosody features and the affective domain. Group differences were found to vary for males and females, depending on the task. Differences in temporal aspects of speech were found to be the most consistent difference between apathetic and non-apathetic patients. Machine learning models trained on speech features achieved top performances of AUC = 0.88 for males and AUC = 0.77 for females. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reinforce the usability of speech as a reliable biomarker in the detection and assessment of apathy.

T1  - Medial temporal lobe atrophy is independently associated with behavioural and psychological symptoms in Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1479-8301
Y1  - 2019/01/
ET  - 2018/08/06
AB  - AIM: Evidence describing the contribution of cerebral white matter disease and medial temporal atrophy (MTA) to behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) has been conflicting. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and MTA observed on magnetic resonance imaging with BPSD among patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of a prospective cohort of patients attending a memory clinic, 46 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (mean age: 72.38 ± 7.05 years) were studied. Sociodemographic, cognitive, and BPSD data were collected. BPSD were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Magnetic resonance imaging, WMH, and MTA were rated using the Scheltens scales for the assessment of signal hyperintensities and atrophy of medial temporal lobes. For multivariate analysis, two binary logistic regression analyses were carried out, with presence or absence of each BPSD as the dependent variable and with WMH or MTA as the predictor variable. Results of the logistic regression were analyzed to see if the significance of the WMH or MTA score was maintained in a model that factored in other possible confounding variables identified in univariate analysis. RESULTS: The results of binary logistic regression analysis showed that in models that accounted for confounding variables, increased total MTA was significantly associated with apathy (odds ratio = 1.605, adjusted P = 0.042) and disinhibition (odds ratio = 0.607, adjusted P = 0.042). WMH measures did not significantly predict any BPSD item. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that MTA potentially contributes to the aetiology of BPSD, and they provide evidence to support the hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease pathology itself can contribute to BPSD.

T1  - Characteristics of apathy in treatment-naïve patients with Parkinson's disease

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although apathy is a common psychiatric symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), there are many unknown aspects of its pathology. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of apathy in treatment-naïve patients with early-stage PD. METHODS: Fifty treatment-naïve patients with early-stage PD were divided into 1 of 2 groups-apathetic or non-apathetic-based on Starkstein Apathy Scale (AS) scores. Cognitive function, depressive symptoms, olfactory function, and motor severity were compared between the two groups using validated assessment scales. Multiple linear regression was performed to assess the association between AS scores and clinical parameters. RESULTS: Apathy (AS score ≥16) was observed in 13 (26%) patients. Assessment scale scores (Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition [p < .004]; modified Hoehn & Yahr stage [p = .039]; Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III [p < .001]) were significantly higher in apathetic patients than in non-apathetic patients. Significant association between these scale scores and AS score was also evident (all p ≤ .001). There were no significant differences in the test scores derived from several other validated scales. CONCLUSION: Apathy was observed in 26% of treatment-naïve patients with early-stage PD. Significant association between apathy and motor severity was found, suggesting that dysfunction of the dopaminergic pathway is involved in the pathology of apathy.

T1  - Does the Geriatric Depression Scale measure depression in Parkinson's disease?
LA  - eng
SN  - 1099-1166
Y1  - 2018/12/
ET  - 2018/09/25
AB  - The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is recommended for screening depression in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Empirical evidence, however, is limited regarding its validity and factor structure in PD. Thus, the current study sought to evaluate the convergent and divergent validity of the GDS, as well as the structure and validity of the derived factors. METHOD: Nondemented individuals with PD (n = 158) completed the GDS-30, and items were subjected to a principle component analysis. Geriatric Depression Scale total and factor scores were correlated with depression items from the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRSd) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMDd), as well as with the Apathy Scale (AS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Parkinson's disease Sleep Scale, and a Subjective Cognitive Function composite score. RESULTS: The GDS total score was strongly correlated with divergent neuropsychiatric measures (AS, r = 0.57; STAI, r = 0.66; MFIS, r = 0.60), while only moderately correlated with convergent measures (MDS-UPDRSd, r = 0.36; HAMDd, r = 0.32; Ps < 0.05). Linear regression analyses revealed standardized measures of anxiety, apathy, and fatigue independently predicted the GDS total score, while depression items (MDS-UPDRSd and HAMDd) failed to reach significance. Three independent factors were identified: Anxiety, Apathy, and Fatigue. These factors were significantly predicted by their respective convergent measures. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings suggest that the GDS and its subscales appear to primarily measure anxiety, apathy, and fatigue in PD, or alternatively, these symptom dimensions may be predominant in PD-depression. Future research with clinically diagnosed samples is needed to confirm these initial findings.

T1  - Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI): Psychometric characteristics of an instrument for routine assessment of persons with psychoses and related disorders
LA  - eng

Y1  - 2018/12/
ET  - 2018/03/22
AB  - This study explores the psychometric characteristics of the Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI), an instrument for routine clinical assessment of behavior problems in outpatients with psychosis based on information provided by key family informants. Six hundred and twenty-one patients diagnosed with psychosis and bipolar affective disorder (ICD-10 F20-F31) attended at Community Mental Health Units were evaluated in routine reviews using the BPI and the Social Functioning Scale (SFS). Twenty-five subjects were simultaneously administered the Social Behavior Schedule (SBS) and 28 were again administered the BPI eight weeks later. The instrument shows adequate psychometric characteristics with high internal consistency and robust temporal reliability, as well as satisfactory concurrent and construct validity. Factor analysis identified three factors: Underactivity/Social Withdrawal, Active Problems and Lack of Impulse Control, with adequate saturation of the items on each of the factors. The BPI is easy to apply, reliable and valid, takes up little of valuable clinical time, allowing routine assessment in public service contexts for persons diagnosed with psychosis and bipolar affective disorder for whom key family informants are available.

T1  - Validity and feasibility of the Arabic version of distress thermometer for Saudi cancer patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 1932-6203
Y1  - 2018/11/14
AB  - BACKGROUND: The distress thermometer (DT) has been studied and validated as an effective screening instrument for identifying distress among cancer patients worldwide. This study aims to evaluate the validity of the Arabic version of the DT in Saudi cancer patients, to define the optimal cutoff point of the Arabic DT for detecting clinically significant distress and to determine whether there is any correlation between clinically significant distress and other demographic and Problem List variables. METHODS: The original form of the DT was translated to Arabic using a forward and backward translation method. Then, a group of 247 cancer patients who were followed up at the Outpatient Oncology Clinic at King Saud Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, completed a socio-demographic and clinical status questionnaire, the DT and the Problem List scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses picked out an area under the curve of 0.76 when compared with a HADS cutoff score of 15. The DT had the best sensitivity (0.70) and specificity (0.63) with cutoff score of 4. A DT score of 4 or more was found to have a statistically significant correlation with female gender, advanced cancer stages and most of the Problem List items, including child care, work or school, treatment decision, dealing with children and partners, depression, fears, nervousness, sadness, loss of interest in usual activity, religious concerns, appearance, bathing/dressing, breathing, diarrhea, fatigue, feeling swollen, fever, getting around, indigestion, memory and concentration, nausea, dry nose, pain, and sexual problems. In contrast, a multivariate regression analysis confirmed only advanced cancer stages, treatment decision, depression, fear, sadness, worry, breathing, feeling swollen, fever, indigestion, memory and concentration, dry nose and congestion, pain and sleep as independent factors associated with distress in cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found the Arabic version of the DT to be a valid instrument for screening distress in Saudi patients with cancer. Our study proposes using a cutoff score of 4 as an indicator of clinically significant distress in this population.

T1  - Changes in Body Mass Index and Physical Activity Predict Changes in Vitality During a Weight Loss Trial in Breast Cancer Survivors
LA  - eng
SN  - 1532-4796
SN  - 0883-6612
Y1  - 2018/11/12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survivors rank fatigue (e.g., decreased vitality) as their number one concern affecting quality of life. Excess adiposity is associated with decreased vitality in breast cancer survivors, yet weight loss intervention trials report inconsistent effects on this parameter. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the Exercise and Nutrition to Enhance Recovery and Good Health for You trial, in which 692 overweight or obese breast cancer survivors ≤5 years from diagnosis, initiated weight loss interventions, and completed assessments semi-annually for 2 years. Assessments included the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire and the SF-36 MOS vitality subscale as an inverse measure of fatigue. Multilevel structural equation models estimated the direct effects of physical activity on vitality and indirect effects through body mass index (BMI) changes. RESULTS: Within-person findings show that at assessments with greater physical activity, BMI was significantly lower (B = -0.07, p < 0.001) and vitality was higher (B = 0.22, p < 0.001). However, there was no direct relationship between lower BMI and higher vitality (B = -0.11, p = 0.262) after controlling for the relationship of physical activity with BMI and physical activity with vitality. The between-person indirect effect of physical activity change through BMI change to vitality was significant (B = 0.03, p < 0.001). Participants whose physical activity was above the mean (B = 0.37, p < 0.001) and whose BMI was below the mean (B = -1.05, p < 0.001) were more likely to report greater vitality. CONCLUSION: Improvements in vitality are primarily associated with increases in physical activity rather than BMI changes in this trial. Vitality was lower among survivors with higher BMI, although within-individual changes in BMI had no effect on vitality. Physical activity and weight loss share mechanistic links to vitality with physical activity potentially increasing (e.g., in an additive or synergistic manner) the effect of BMI reduction on vitality.

AB  - Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) have not been comprehensively studied in people with Down syndrome, despite their high risk on dementia. A novel evaluation scale was developed to identify the nature, frequency and severity of behavioral changes (83 behavioral items in 12 clinically defined sections). Central aim was to identify items that change in relation to the dementia status. Structured interviews were conducted with informants of people with Down syndrome without dementia (DS, N = 149), with questionable dementia (DS + TD, N = 65) and with diagnosed dementia (DS + AD, N = 67). Group comparisons showed a pronounced increase in frequency and severity of items about anxiety, sleep disturbances, agitation & stereotypical behavior, aggression, apathy, depressive symptoms, and, eating/drinking behavior. The proportion of individuals presenting an increase was highest in the DS + AD group and lowest in the DS group. Interestingly, among DS + TD individuals, a substantial proportion already presented increased anxiety, sleep disturbances, apathy and depressive symptoms, suggesting that these changes may be early alarm signals of dementia. The scale may contribute to a better understanding of the changes, adapting daily care/support, and providing suitable therapies to people with Down syndrome. The scale needs to be optimized based on the results and experiences. The applicability, reliability and validity require further study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a frequent symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), substantially aggravating the course of PD. Regarding the accumulating evidence of the key role of apathy in PD, time-efficient assessments are useful for fostering progress in research and treatment. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is widely used for the assessment of apathy across different nosologies. OBJECTIVE: To facilitate the application of the AES in PD, we reduced the AES to two-thirds its length and validated this abbreviated version. DESIGN: Data sets of 339 PD patients of the DEMPARK/LANDSCAPE study without dementia and depression were randomly split into two samples. Data of sample 1 were used to develop a brief version of the AES (AES-12PD). A cross-validation was conducted in sample 2 and in a subsample of 42 PD patients with comorbid dementia and depressive symptomatology. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was applied to determine the optimal cutoff of the AES-12PD as an indicator of apathy. RESULTS: The AES-12PD featured high internal consistency that was better compared to the AES. The abbreviated scale was well differentiated from motor impairment and cognitive deficits. The AES-12PD cutoff of 27/28 was the optimal cutoff for apathy in PD patients without dementia and depression. The cutoff of 25/26 indicated apathy in PD patients with comorbid dementia and depression. CONCLUSION: Results confirm a high internal consistency and good discriminant validity of the AES-12PD. The AES-12PD represents a reliable tool for the efficient assessment of apathy that can be applied in PD patients with and without dementia and depression.

T1  - Factor structure of the Geriatric Depression Scale and measurement invariance across gender among Chinese elders
LA  - eng
SN  - 1573-2517
Y1  - 2018/10/01
ET  - 2018/05/17
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is commonly used in research and clinical settings for screening of depression. The current study aimed to examine the best-fit factor structure model of the GDS among Chinese elders and to evaluate the measurement invariance of the GDS across genders. METHODS: Participants included 1,553 elderly residents from the Hunan, Shandong, and Beijing provinces. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted in tandem to determine the structure of the GDS on a large scale. Multigroup CFA (N = 1553, 45.24% male, mean = 71.33 ± 8.06) was utilized to test the measurement invariance of the depressive symptom structure, which was generated by EFA and confirmed by CFA across gender. RESULTS: A three-factor model with 15 depression, 9 apathy and 4 vigor items presented the best fit indices. Measurement invariance of the new proposed model across gender was supported fully assuming different degrees of invariance. LIMITATIONS: Our sample was entirely Chinese, and thus may not be representative of populations outside of China. Our results are based on a cross-sectional study, which did not take into consideration changes that may occur over time within individuals. CONCLUSIONS: A three-factor model best fits the depressive symptom structure of the GDS among elderly Chinese, with measurement invariance across genders.

T1  - Adherence to a Mediterranean diet is associated with lower incidence of frailty: A longitudinal cohort study
LA  - eng

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is a paucity of data investigating the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and frailty, with no data among North American people. We aimed to investigate if adherence to a Mediterranean diet is associated with a lower incidence of frailty in a large cohort of North American people. METHODS: This study included subjects at higher risk or having knee osteoarthritis. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was evaluated using a validated Mediterranean diet score (aMED) as proposed by Panagiotakos and classified into five categories. Frailty was defined using the Study of Osteoporotic Fracture (SOF) index as the presence of ≥2 out of: (i) weight loss ≥5% between baseline and the subsequent follow-up visit; (ii) inability to do five chair stands; (iii) low energy level. RESULTS: During the 8 years follow-up, of the 4421 participants initially included (mean age: 61.2 years, % of females = 58.0), the incidence of frailty was approximately half in those with a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet (8 for 1000 person years) vs. those with a lower adherence (15 for 1000 persons-years). After adjusting for 10 potential confounders (age, sex, race, body mass index, education, smoking habits, yearly income, physical activity level, Charlson co-morbidity index and daily energy intake), participants with the highest aMED scores were found to have a significant reduction in incident frailty (hazard ratio = 0.71; 95% CIs: 0.50-0.99, p = 0.047) with respect to those in a lower category. Regarding individual components of the Mediterranean diet, low consumption of poultry was found to be associated with higher risk of frailty. CONCLUSIONS: A higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower incidence of frailty over an 8-year follow-up period, even after adjusting for potential confounders.

T1  - Social Withdrawal Among Individuals Receiving Psychiatric Care: Derivation of a Scale Using Routine Clinical Assessment Data to Support Screening and Outcome Measurement
LA  - eng
SN  - 1556-3308
Y1  - 2018/10/
AB  - Social withdrawal is a symptom experienced by individuals with an array of mental health conditions, particularly those with schizophrenia and mood disorders. Assessments of social withdrawal are often lengthy and may not be routinely integrated within the comprehensive clinical assessment of the individual. This study utilized item response and classical test theory methods to derive a Social Withdrawal Scale (SWS) using items embedded within a routine clinical assessment, the RAI-Mental Health (RAI-MH). Using data from 60,571 inpatients in Ontario, Canada, a common factor analysis identified seven items from the RAI-MH that measure social withdrawal. A graded response model found that six items had acceptable discrimination parameters: lack of motivation, reduced interaction, decreased energy, flat affect, anhedonia, and loss of interest. Summing these items, the SWS was found to have strong internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.82) and showed a medium to large effect size (d = 0.77) from admission to discharge. Fewer individuals with high SWS scores participated in social activity or reported having a confidant compared to those with lower scores. Since the RAI-MH is available across clinical subgroups in several jurisdictions, the SWS is a useful tool for screening, clinical decision support, and evaluation.

T1  - Which levels of cognitive impairments and negative symptoms are related to functional deficits in schizophrenia?
LA  - eng
SN  - 1879-1379
Y1  - 2018/09/
ET  - 2018/07/07
AB  - BACKGROUND: Negative symptoms and cognitive impairments predict difficulties in aspects of everyday functioning in schizophrenia, with little research to date attempting to determine if there are threshold levels of impairment required to predict the severity of functional deficits. METHODS: People diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia (n = 821) were assessed with the MCCB and PANSS, and rated by high contact informants with SLOF. Negative symptoms of reduced emotional experience were specifically targeted for analysis because of their previously identified relationships with social outcomes. We identified patients with moderate negative symptoms (at least one PANSS item ≥4) versus less severe symptoms (PANSS items ≤3) and divided patients on the basis of a single latent-trait global cognition score (neuropsychologically normal vs neuropsychologically impaired; performance at or below 1.0 SD from the normative population mean, T = 40), then examined correlations between cognition, negative symptoms and everyday functioning in the groups with lower and higher negative symptoms and those with/without cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Even low levels of negative symptoms were correlated with ratings of social functioning. Cognitive performance in the neuropsychologically normal range, in contrast, was not correlated with any aspects of everyday functioning while more impaired performance predicted greater functional impairments. CONCLUSIONS: Even minimal symptoms may be a target for clinical attention in the domains of negative symptoms, consistent with previous findings regarding social deficits in populations with modest negative symptoms (e.g., schizotypal personality disorder). Cognitive rehabilitation treatments might not improve social functioning if even low levels of negative symptoms (social amotivation) are present.

T1  - Reliability and validity of the self-report version of the apathy evaluation scale in first-episode Psychosis: Concordance with the clinical version at baseline and 12 months follow-up

AB  - Negative symptoms have traditionally been assessed based on clinicians' observations. The subjective experience of negative symptoms in people with psychosis may bring new insight. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is commonly used to study apathy in psychosis and has corresponding self-rated (AES-S) and clinician-rated (AES-C) versions. The aim of the present study was to determine the validity and reliability of the AES-S by investigating its concordance with the AES-C. Eighty-four first-episode (FEP) patients completed the shortened 12-item AES-S and AES-C at baseline (T1) and 12 months (T2). Concordance was studied by degree of correlation, comparison of mean scores, and change and difference between diagnostic groups. The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) was used to study convergent and discriminative properties. High concordance was found between AES-S and AES-C at both T1 and T2 regarding mean values, change from T1 to T2, and the proportion with high levels of apathy. Both versions indicated high levels of apathy in FEP, while associations with PANSS negative symptoms were weaker for AES-S than AES-C. Controlling for depression did not significantly alter results. We concluded that self-rated apathy in FEP patients is in concordance with clinician ratings, but in need of further study.

AB  - A valid method to diagnose depression in palliative care has not been established. In this study, we aim to determine the prevalence of depression and the discriminant validity of the items of four sets of diagnostic criteria in palliative care. This is a cross-sectional study on 240 palliative care patients where the presence of depression was based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM⁻IV Criteria, Modified DSM⁻IV Criteria, Cavanaugh Criteria, and Endicott's Criteria's. Anxiety, depression, and distress were measured with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Distress Thermometer. The prevalence of depression among the palliative care patients was highest based on the Modified DSM⁻IV Criteria (23.3%), followed by the Endicott's Criteria (13.8%), DSM⁻IV Criteria (9.2%), and Cavanaugh Criteria (5%). There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the depressive symptoms showed by DSM⁻IV item 1 (dysphoric mood), item 2 (loss of interest or pleasure), and Endicott's criteria item 8 (brooding, self-pity, or pessimism) among the palliative patients, even after adjustment for the anxiety symptoms and distress level. We found that dysphoric mood, loss of interest, and pessimism are the main features of depression in palliative patients. These symptoms should be given more attention in identifying depression in palliative care patients.

T1  - Development and validation of the cancer self-perceived discrimination scale for Chinese cancer patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 1477-7525
Y1  - 2018/08/14
AB  - BACKGROUND: To develop a Cancer Self-Perceived Discrimination Scale (CSPDS) for Chinese cancer patients and to assess its reliability and validity. METHOD: A total of 178 patients were recruited and the classical test theory was used to develop the CSPDS. Item analysis was adapted to improve the preliminary version of the CSPDS, then the reliability, the validity and the acceptability of the final version of CSPDS were assessed. RESULTS: This CSPDS contained 14 items classified into 3 subscales: social withdrawal with 7 items, stigma with 4 and self-deprecation with 3. Good validity (χ(2)/df = 1.216, GFI = 0.935, AGFI = 0.903, I-CVIs> 0.80) and good reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.829, Spearman-Brown coefficient = 0.827, test-retest reliability coefficient = 0.944) were found. The completion time was 6.06 ± 1.80 min. Participants who were female and reported poor self-rated health tended to have higher CSPDS scores (P <  0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that this CSPDS could be used to assess the level of self-perceived discrimination and to preliminarily screen perceived discrimination among Chinese cancer patients, especially in Southwest China. It may provide a basis for scientific assessment of targeted patient education, psychological counseling, social interventions, and psychotherapy in the future.

T1  - Personality traits and course of symptoms of depression and apathy after stroke: Results of the CASPER study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1879-1360
Y1  - 2018/08/
ET  - 2018/05/21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Post-stroke depression (PSD) and post-stroke apathy (PSA) are both associated with adverse outcome after stroke. This study aimed to examine whether personality traits predict the course of PSD and PSA. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 240 stroke patients completed the NEO Five Factor Inventory, Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, and Apathy Evaluation Scale at 3 months post-stroke. Neuropsychiatric assessment was repeated at 6- and 12-month follow-up after initial testing. RESULTS: Linear mixed models showed that high neuroticism scores were associated with higher depression levels at baseline, and this association remained stable at follow-up. High extraversion scores and high conscientiousness scores were associated with lower apathy levels at baseline. For neuroticism, a significant interaction with time was found, with higher neuroticism scores at baseline being associated with an increase in apathy scores from 6-month to 12-month follow-up. Prospective analyses showed that high extraversion predicted low apathy levels at 6-month and 12-month follow-up independent of its relations with baseline depression and apathy. High neuroticism predicted high apathy levels at 12-month follow-up, whereas high agreeableness and high openness predicted high apathy levels and low apathy levels, respectively, at 6-month follow-up. None of the personality traits predicted depression scores at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Personality traits are associated with the development and sustainability of PSD and PSA. The traits associated with PSD and PSA were different, providing support for the independence of these constructs. The findings highlight the importance to take personality traits into account as a potential vulnerability factor for PSD and PSA.

T1  - Interoceptive processing deficit: A behavioral marker for subtyping Parkinson's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-5126
Y1  - 2018/08/
ET  - 2018/05/05
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), such as cognitive, emotional, autonomic and somatosensory alterations, are not ubiquitous but vary between the tremor dominant (TD) and postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) subtypes of the syndrome. Non-motor phenomena (e.g., anxiety, depression and apathy) have been related to representation of autonomic and somatosensory sensations (interoception), and recent findings suggest interoceptive deficits in PD. OBJECTIVES: To test whether interoceptive processing is differently affected in TD and PIGD phenotypes, by assessing both interoceptive accuracy and sensibility in PD patients with TD and PIGD subtypes, and in healthy controls. METHODS: Interoceptive accuracy was measured by the heartbeat perception task requiring participants to count their own heartbeats in a given time interval. A time-estimation, control task was also administered asking participants to count the seconds in a set period of time. Interoceptive sensibility was assessed by a questionnaire of subjective interoception. Finally, the patients underwent measures of anxiety, depression, apathy and anhedonia, and impulsive-compulsive disturbances. RESULTS: The main results showed reduced interoceptive accuracy and sensibility in TD patients relative to both PIGD patients and healthy controls. Reduced interoceptive accuracy of TD group was a reliable result since their performance on the time estimation control task was comparable to that of both PIGD patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that the behavioural assessment of different aspects of interoceptive processing can provide with a further marker for subtyping patients with PD.

T1  - Psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Cognitive Reserve Scale (I-CRS)
LA  - eng
SN  - 1590-3478
Y1  - 2018/08/
ET  - 2018/05/04
AB  - The original definition of cognitive reserve (CR) refers to the individual differences in cognitive performance after a brain damage or pathology. Several proxies were proposed to evaluate CR (education, occupational attainment, premorbid IQ, leisure activities). Recently, some scales were developed to measure CR taking into account several cognitively stimulating activities. The aim of this study is to adapt the Cognitive Reserve Scale (I-CRS) for the Italian population and to explore its psychometric properties. I-CRS was administered to 547 healthy participants, ranging from 18 to 89 years old, along with neuropsychological and behavioral scales to evaluate cognitive functioning, depressive symptoms, and apathy. Cronbach's α, corrected item-total correlations, and the inter-item correlation matrix were calculated to evaluate the psychometric properties of the scale. Linear regression analysis was performed to build a correction grid of the I-CRS according to demographic variables. Correlational analyses were performed to explore the relationships between I-CRS and neuropsychological and behavioral scales. We found that age, sex, and education influenced the I-CRS score. Young adults and adults obtained higher I-CRS scores than elderly adults; women and participants with high educational attainment scored higher on I-CRS than men and participants with low education. I-CRS score correlated poorly with cognitive and depression scale scores, but moderately with apathy scale scores. I-CRS showed good psychometric properties and seemed to be a useful tool to assess CR in every adult life stage. Moreover, our findings suggest that apathy rather than depressive symptoms may interfere with the building of CR across the lifespan.

T1  - Identifying reliable predictors of protein-energy malnutrition in hospitalized frail older adults: A prospective longitudinal study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-491X
Y1  - 2018/06/
ET  - 2018/03/07
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decreased food intake is a risk factor for relevant complications (e.g. infections, pressure ulcers), longer hospital stays, higher readmission rates, greater health care costs and increased patient mortality, particularly in frail hospitalized older adults who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition. Nurses are called to improve this criticality, starting from accurately identifying malnourished patients at hospital admission and effectively monitoring their food intake. OBJECTIVES: The primary aim was to identify reliable predictive indicators of reduced food intake at hospital admission. The secondary aims were to assess the adequacy of daily energy and protein intake and the impact of nutrient intake on patient outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective observational longitudinal study. SETTING: Internal Medicine Ward of an Academic Teaching University Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Acute older adults who were malnourished or at risk of malnutrition (Nutritional Risk Score-2002 ≥ 3, middle-upper arm circumference <23.5 cm or impaired self-feeding ability) at admission. METHODS: The effective energy and protein intake was monitored during the first 5 days of hospital stay by a photographic method and compared to the daily energy and protein requirement calculated by specific equations. Data on anthropometry, inflammation/malnutrition laboratory data and body composition (phase angle calculated using bioelectrical impedance analysis) were collected. RESULTS: Eighty-one subjects (age 81.5 ± 11.5 years) were enrolled. Mean energy intake was 669.0 ± 573.9 kcal/day, and mean protein intake was 30.7 ± 25.8 g/day. Over 60% of patients ingested ≤50% of their calculated energy and protein requirements: these patients were older (p = 0.026), had a lower middle-upper arm circumference (p = 0.022) and total arm area (p = 0.038), a higher C-reactive protein/albumin ratio and Instant Nutritional Assessment score (p < 0.01), and experienced longer hospital stays (p ≤ 0.04) and higher in-hospital and 30-day post-discharge mortality (p < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, lower middle-upper arm circumference, higher C-reactive protein/albumin ratio, and impaired self-feeding at admission were independently associated with critically reduced energy and protein intake. CONCLUSIONS: Middle-upper arm circumference, C-reactive protein/albumin ratio, and impaired self-feeding are easily obtainable indicators of impaired energy and protein intake and poor clinical outcomes. Such parameters should be adopted as screening criteria to assess the risk for critically reduced energy/protein intake in hospitalized older adults. These findings are relevant to improve clinical practice through the implementation of multidisciplinary strategies, given the adverse clinical outcomes related to hospital malnutrition.

T1  - Apathy, not depressive symptoms, as a predictor of semantic and phonemic fluency task performance in stroke and transient ischemic attack
LA  - eng
SN  - 1744-411X
Y1  - 2018/06/
ET  - 2017/09/15
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the relationship between apathy and cognition in patients with cerebrovascular disease. Apathy may result from damage to frontal subcortical circuits causing dysexecutive syndromes, but apathy is also related to depression. We assessed the ability of apathy to predict phonemic fluency and semantic fluency performance after controlling for depressive symptoms in 282 individuals with stroke and/or transient ischemic attack. METHOD: Participants (N = 282) completed the Phonemic Fluency Test, Semantic Fluency Test, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and Apathy Evaluation Scale. A cross-sectional correlational design was utilized. RESULTS: Using hierarchical linear regressions, apathy scores significantly predicted semantic fluency performance (β = -.159, p = .020), but not phonemic fluency performance (β = -.112, p = .129) after scaling scores by age and years of education and controlling for depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms entered into the first step of both hierarchical linear regressions did not predict semantic fluency (β = -.035, p = .554) or phonemic fluency (β = -.081, p = .173). Apathy and depressive symptoms were moderately correlated, r(280) = .58, p < .001. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are consistent with research supporting a differentiation between phonemic and semantic fluency tasks, whereby phonemic fluency tasks primarily involve frontal regions, and semantic fluency tasks involve recruitment of more extended networks. The results also highlight a distinction between apathy and depressive symptoms and suggest that apathy may be a more reliable predictor of cognitive deficits than measures of mood in individuals with cerebrovascular disease. Apathy may also be more related to cognition due to overlapping motivational and cognitive frontal subcortical circuitry. Future research should explore whether treatments for apathy could be a novel target for improving cognitive outcomes after stroke.

T1  - Clinical and Psychosocial Factors Influencing Retinal Screening Uptake Among Young Adults with Type 2 Diabetes
LA  - eng
SN  - 1539-0829
Y1  - 2018/05/24
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Young adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D, 18-39 years) experience early-onset and rapid progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR), the leading cause of vision loss for working age adults. Despite this, uptake of retinal screening, the crucial first step in preventing vision loss from DR, is low. The aim of this review is to summarize the clinical and psychosocial factors affecting uptake of retinal screening. RECENT FINDINGS: Barriers include lack of diabetes-related symptoms, low personal DR risk perception, high rates of depression and diabetes-related distress, fatalism about inevitability of complications, time and financial constraints, disengagement with existing diabetes self-management services, and perceived stigma due to having a condition associated with older adults. Young adults with T2D are an under-researched population who face an accumulation of barriers to retinal screening. Tailored interventions that address the needs, characteristics, and priorities of young adults with T2D are warranted.

T1  - Validity and reliability of the Traditional Chinese version of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory in general population
LA  - eng
SN  - 1932-6203
Y1  - 2018/05/10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common symptom in the general population and has a substantial effect on individuals' quality of life. The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) has been widely used to quantify the impact of fatigue, but no Traditional Chinese translation has yet been validated. The goal of this study was to translate the MFI from English into Traditional Chinese ('the MFI-TC') and subsequently to examine its validity and reliability. METHODS: The study recruited a convenience sample of 123 people from various age groups in Taiwan. The MFI was examined using a two-step process: (1) translation and back-translation of the instrument; and (2) examination of construct validity, convergent validity, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and measurement error. The validity and reliability of the MFI-TC were assessed by factor analysis, Spearman rho correlation coefficient, Cronbach's alpha coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), minimal detectable change (MDC), and Bland-Altman analysis. All participants completed the Short-Form-36 Health Survey Taiwan Form (SF-36-T) and the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) concurrently to test the convergent validity of the MFI-TC. Test-retest reliability was assessed by readministration of the MFI-TC after a 1-week interval. RESULTS: Factor analysis confirmed the four dimensions of fatigue: general/physical fatigue, reduced activity, reduced motivation, and mental fatigue. A four-factor model was extracted, combining general fatigue and physical fatigue as one factor. The results demonstrated moderate convergent validity when correlating fatigue (MFI-TC) with quality of life (SF-36-T) and sleep disturbances (PSQI) (Spearman's rho = 0.68 and 0.47, respectively). Cronbach's alpha for the MFI-TC total scale and subscales ranged from 0.73 (mental fatigue subscale) to 0.92 (MFI-TC total scale). ICCs ranged from 0.85 (reduced motivation) to 0.94 (MFI-TC total scale), and the MDC ranged from 2.33 points (mental fatigue) to 9.5 points (MFI-TC total scale). The Bland-Altman analyses showed no significant systematic bias between the repeated assessments. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the use of the Traditional Chinese version of the MFI as a comprehensive instrument for measuring specific aspects of fatigue. Clinicians and researchers should consider interpreting general fatigue and physical fatigue as one subscale when measuring fatigue in Traditional Chinese-speaking populations.

T1  - Patterns and predictors of exhaustion episodes in patients with stable COPD: A longitudinal study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1742-1241
Y1  - 2018/05/
ET  - 2018/02/12
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Exhaustion is the perception of low energy. Little is known about how exhaustion persists, remits or reappears over time in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or how to predict these events. We determined the likelihood of transitions between states of exhaustion and no exhaustion among patients with stable COPD followed up for 2 years. We investigated combinations of potential factors for their abilities to predict new-onset exhaustion episodes. METHODS: We prospectively included 137 patients with stable COPD (mean age, 66.9 years ± 8.3). Exhaustion states were measured at baseline and 1 and 2 years later. Exhaustion was defined as an answer of "most of the time" or "a moderate amount of time" to 1 of 2 questions: "How often have you found it hard to get going?" and "How often does everything seem to require effort?" We evaluated demographic, non-respiratory and respiratory variables as potential predictors. The likelihoods of new episodes and recovery were calculated. Predictors were evaluated with generalised estimating equations. RESULTS: At baseline, 27 patients (19.7%) displayed exhaustion. Of the 110 patients without exhaustion at baseline, 17 (15.5%) displayed exhaustion at least once during the follow-up period. During the study period, a total of 204 annual transitions displaying no exhaustion at the beginning were identified. Of them, 10.3% transitioned to exhaustion in the next year. The likelihood of recovery after exhaustion was 50%. Independent predictors of new-onset exhaustion episodes within the following year were: the COPD assessment test score (odds ratio [OR] = 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.21), depression (OR = 6.89; 95% CI: 1.00-47.41) and female gender (OR = 6.88; 95% CI: 1.83-25.73). CONCLUSIONS: Patients in stable COPD with high CAT scores and depression were most likely to experience new-onset exhaustion episodes Thus, exhaustion might be predicted by a combination of psychological factors and respiratory health status. Nevertheless, exhaustion is dynamic in COPD; half of patients recover from exhaustion.

T1  - Frailty, Disability, and Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Older Adults
LA  - eng
SN  - 1538-9375
Y1  - 2018/05/
ET  - 2017/12/30
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Frailty and disability are associated with cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, in older people; however, little is known about their association with ambulatory blood pressure (BP). Thus, we assessed the relationship of frailty and disability with ambulatory BP in older adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of 1047 community-living individuals aged ≥60 years in Spain. MEASUREMENTS: BP was determined with validated devices under standardized conditions during 24 hours. Frailty was defined as having 3 or more of the following criteria: weight loss, low grip strength, low energy, slow gait speed, and low physical activity. Disability was assessed with the Lawton-Brodýs questionnaire on instrumental activities of daily living. Associations with systolic BP (SBP) and dipping (nocturnal SBP decline) were modeled and adjusted for sociodemographic variables, body mass index, lifestyles, antihypertensive drug treatment, comorbidities, 24-hour heart rate, and conventional or ambulatory SBP as appropriate. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 71.7 years (50.8% men); 6% were frail and 8.1% had disability. Compared with nonfrail participants, those with frailty had 3.5 mm Hg lower daytime SBP (P = .001), 3.3% less SBP dipping (P = .003), and 3.6 mmHg higher nighttime SBP (P = .016). Compared with participants who are not disabled, those who are disabled had 2.5 mmHg lower daytime SBP (P = .002), 2.5% less SBP dipping (P = .003), and 2.7 mmHg higher nighttime SBP (P = .011). CONCLUSIONS: In community-dwelling older adults, frailty and disability were independently associated with lower diurnal SBP, blunted nocturnal decline of SBP, and higher nocturnal SBP. These findings may help explain the higher mortality associated with low clinic SBP in frail older subjects observed in epidemiologic studies.

T1  - Motivational profiles, accelerometer-derived physical activity, and acute diabetes-related symptoms in adults with type 2 diabetes
LA  - eng
SN  - 1471-2458
Y1  - 2018/04/10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Using self-determination theory, the objective of this study was to examine, over a one-month period, how physical activity (PA) motivation would influence accelerometer-derived PA behavior, and ultimately, acute diabetes-related symptoms burden among adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D adults). Using both a person and variable-centered approach, this objective was attained by means of: 1) investigating the indirect effect of PA participation on the relationship between PA motivation and acute diabetes-related symptom burden and 2) examining whether participants who met PA recommendations (i.e., 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous PA per week) would experience less acute diabetes-related symptom burden over a one-month period. METHODS: A two-wave prospective longitudinal design was used. At time 1, participants completed a questionnaire assessing their PA motivation and were asked to wear an ActiGraph GT3x accelerometer for four consecutive weeks. At time 2, they completed a short questionnaire assessing their acute diabetes-related symptoms (i.e., symptoms related to fatigue, cognitive distress, hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia). The final sample includes 165 adults (89 or 53.61% women) aged from 26 to 75 years (M = 62.05, SD = 8.75) with T2D, which provided at least 21 valid days of accelerometer-derived data. RESULTS: First, results of a path analysis demonstrated that over a one-month period, the average number of minutes spent practicing moderate to vigorous PA per week mediated the relationship between intrinsic and external PA motivation and the level of burden associated with the following diabetes-related symptoms: fatigue, cognitive distress, and hyperglycemia. In addition, results of covariance analyses showed that participants meeting PA recommendations also reported significantly less burden associated with these three symptoms over a month period. Then, the existence of four motivational profiles (Self-Determined, High Introjected, Low Motivation, and Non-Self-Determined) was confirmed using a k-means analysis. Results of covariance and chi-square analyses further showed, respectively, that compared to other motivational profiles, the Self-Determined profile was associated with a higher score on weekly PA participation and meeting PA recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of promoting autonomous motives for PA participation among T2D adults. They also suggest that T2D adults meeting PA recommendations experience less acute diabetes-related symptoms burden, which further support the importance of their PA motivation.

T1  - Participation in bowel screening among men attending abdominal aortic aneurysm screening
LA  - eng
SN  - 1365-2168
Y1  - 2018/04/
ET  - 2018/02/21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uptake of population-based screening for colorectal cancer in Scotland is around 55 per cent. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening has recently been introduced for men aged 65 years and the reported uptake is 78 per cent. The aim was to determine the impact of a brief intervention on bowel screening in men who attended AAA screening, but previously failed to complete bowel screening. METHODS: Men invited for AAA screening between September 2015 and March 2016 within NHS Tayside were included. Attendees who had not responded to their latest bowel screening invitation were seen by a colorectal cancer clinical nurse specialist. Reasons for not completing the faecal occult blood test (FOBT) were recorded; brief information on colorectal cancer screening was communicated, and participants were offered a further invitation to complete a FOBT. Those who responded positively were sent a further FOBT from the Scottish Bowel Screening Centre. Subsequent return of a completed FOBT within 6 months was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 556 men were invited for AAA screening, of whom 38·1 per cent had not completed a recent FOBT. The primary reason stated for not participating was the time taken to complete the test or forgetting it (35·1 per cent). Other reasons included: lack of motivation (23·4 per cent), confusion regarding the aim of screening (16·2 per cent), disgust (19·8 per cent), fear (6·3 per cent) and other health problems (9·9 per cent). Following discussion, 81·1 per cent agreed to complete the FOBT and 49 per cent subsequently returned the test. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of previous bowel screening non-responders subsequently returned a completed FOBT following a brief intervention with a nurse specialist. Attendance at non-bowel screening appointments may provide a valuable opportunity to improve bowel screening uptake.

T1  - Real-Time Observation of Apathy in Long-Term Care Residents With Dementia: Reliability of the Person-Environment Apathy Rating Scale

AB  - Apathy is prevalent in individuals with dementia. Lack of responsiveness to environmental stimulation is a key characteristic of apathy. The Person-Environment Apathy Rating (PEAR) scale consists of environment and apathy subscales, which allow for examination of environmental impact on apathy. The interrater reliability of the PEAR scale was examined via real-time observation. The current study included 45 observations of 15 long-term care residents with dementia. Each participant was observed at three time points for 10 minutes each. Two raters observed the participant and surrounding environment and independently rated the participant's apathy and environmental stimulation using the PEAR scale. Weighted Kappa was 0.5 to 0.82 for the PEAR-Environment subscale and 0.5 to 0.8 for the PEAR-Apathy subscale. Overall, with the exception of three items with relatively weak reliability (0.50 to 0.56), the PEAR scale showed moderate to strong interrater reliability (0.63 to 0.82). The results support the use of the PEAR scale to measure environmental stimulation and apathy via real-time observation in long-term care residents with dementia.

T1  - Assessment of Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS): the dimension of anhedonia in Italian healthy sample
LA  - eng
SN  - 1590-3478
Y1  - 2018/04/
ET  - 2018/01/30
AB  - The Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) is a rapid screening battery created for assessing the presence of anhedonia, namely the inability to experience pleasure. Although, this symptom has widely been investigated in clinical settings, individual differences in anhedonia are also present in healthy population. The aim of present study was to validate the translated Italian version of this test. One thousand six hundred ninety-seven consecutive healthy subjects (55% female) of different ages (age 18-82 years) underwent SHAPS. Participants who showed mild level of anhedonia also completed the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS), Mood Disorders Insight Scale (MDIS), and Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). The SHAPS showed good internal consistency and discriminant validity; moreover, the factorial analysis highlighted that SHAPS had a three-factor structure for explaining the anhedonic construct. 14.9% showed a significant reduction of hedonic tone (SHAPS ≥ 3). Finally, the degree of anhedonia was significantly correlated with BDI and BHS scores, but not with age or gender. Although anhedonia is a prominent feature of many psychiatric and neurological disorders, the presence of this symptom in the healthy population highlighted the importance to develop reliable tool. SHAPS shows good psychometric properties to assess multidimensional anhedonia symptoms also in Italian healthy population.

T1  - The Prevalence and Correlates of Frailty in Urban and Rural Populations in Latin America, China, and India: A 10/66 Population-Based Survey
LA  - eng
SN  - 1538-9375
Y1  - 2018/04/
ET  - 2018/01/03
AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been few cross-national studies of the prevalence of the frailty phenotype conducted among low or middle income countries. We aimed to study the variation in prevalence and correlates of frailty in rural and urban sites in Latin America, India, and China. METHODS: Cross-sectional population-based catchment area surveys conducted in 8 urban and 4 rural catchment areas in 8 countries; Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Peru, Mexico, China, and India. We assessed weight loss, exhaustion, slow walking speed, and low energy consumption, but not hand grip strength. Therefore, frailty phenotype was defined on 2 or more of 4 of the usual 5 criteria. RESULTS: We surveyed 17,031 adults aged 65 years and over. Overall frailty prevalence was 15.2% (95% confidence inteval 14.6%-15.7%). Prevalence was low in rural (5.4%) and urban China (9.1%) and varied between 12.6% and 21.5% in other sites. A similar pattern of variation was apparent after direct standardization for age and sex. Cross-site variation in prevalence of frailty indicators varied across the 4 indicators. Controlling for age, sex, and education, frailty was positively associated with older age, female sex, lower socioeconomic status, physical impairments, stroke, depression, dementia, disability and dependence, and high healthcare costs. DISCUSSION: There was substantial variation in the prevalence of frailty and its indicators across sites in Latin America, India, and China. Culture and other contextual factors may impact significantly on the assessment of frailty using questionnaire and physical performance-based measures, and achieving cross-cultural measurement invariance remains a challenge. CONCLUSIONS: A consistent pattern of correlates was identified, suggesting that in all sites, the frailty screen could identify older adults with multiple physical, mental, and cognitive morbidities, disability and needs for care, compounded by socioeconomic disadvantage and catastrophic healthcare spending.

T1  - Amyloid burden and incident depressive symptoms in preclinical Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1573-2517
Y1  - 2018/03/15
ET  - 2018/01/03
AB  - BACKGROUND: Relationships between depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD) may become clearer if studied in preclinical AD where dementia is not present. METHOD: The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively, relationships between brain amyloid-β (Aβ), depressive symptoms and screen positive depression in cognitively normal (CN) older adults. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Geriatric Depression Inventory (GDS-15) in CN adults from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study without depression at baseline and classified as having abnormally high (Aβ+; n = 136) or low (Aβ-; n = 449) Aβ according to positron emission tomography at 18-month intervals over 72 months. RESULTS: Incident cases of screen positive depression were not increased in Aβ+ CN adults although small increases in overall depressive symptoms severity (d = - 0.25; 95% CI, - 0.45, - 0.05) and apathy-anxiety symptoms (d = - 0.28; 95% CI - 0.48, - 0.08) were. LIMITATIONS: As the AIBL sample is an experimental sample, no individuals had severe medical illnesses or significant psychiatric disorders. Additionally, individuals who had evidence of screen-positive depression at screening were excluded from enrolment in the AIBL study. Thus, the current data can be considered only as providing a foundation for understanding relationships between Aβ and depression in preclinical AD. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the presence of a depressive disorder or even increased depressive symptoms are themselves unlikely to be a direct consequence of increasing Aβ. New depressive disorders presenting in CN older adults could therefore be investigated for aetiologies beyond AD.

T1  - Association of energy and protein intakes with length of stay, readmission and mortality in hospitalised patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1475-2662
Y1  - 2018/03/
AB  - Low energy and protein intakes have been associated with an increased risk of malnutrition in outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We aimed to assess the energy and protein intakes of hospitalised COPD patients according to nutritional risk status and requirements, and the relative contribution from meals, snacks, drinks and oral nutritional supplements (ONS), and to examine whether either energy or protein intake predicts outcomes. Subjects were COPD patients (n 99) admitted to Landspitali University Hospital in 1 year (March 2015-March 2016). Patients were screened for nutritional risk using a validated screening tool, and energy and protein intake for 3 d, 1-5 d after admission to the hospital, was estimated using a validated plate diagram sheet. The percentage of patients reaching energy and protein intake ≥75 % of requirements was on average 59 and 37 %, respectively. Malnourished patients consumed less at mealtimes and more from ONS than lower-risk patients, resulting in no difference in total energy and protein intakes between groups. No clear associations between energy or protein intake and outcomes were found, although the association between energy intake, as percentage of requirement, and mortality at 12 months of follow-up was of borderline significance (OR 0·12; 95 % CI 0·01, 1·15; P=0·066). Energy and protein intakes during hospitalisation in the study population failed to meet requirements. Further studies are needed on how to increase energy and protein intakes during hospitalisation and after discharge and to assess whether higher intake in relation to requirement of hospitalised COPD patients results in better outcomes.

T1  - Reliability and structural validity of the Chinese version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Nursing Home version
LA  - eng
SN  - 1479-8301
Y1  - 2018/03/
ET  - 2018/02/06
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the increasing number of dementia patients in China, there is a pressing need for a reliable and valid Chinese instrument that can measure neuropsychiatric symptoms in institutionalized dementia patients. This study examined the reliability and structural validity of the Chinese version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Nursing Home version (NPI-NH), in a sample of institutionalized dementia patients in China. METHODS: A total of 112 residents with dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating = 1: 10.7%; Clinical Dementia Rating = 2: 39.3%; Clinical Dementia Rating = 3: 50.0%) and 30 informants participated in this cross-sectional study. Reliability was tested using Cronbach's α and intra-class correlation coefficient. Principal component analysis was used to evaluate the factor structure of the inventory. RESULTS: Of the patients, 92.9% had at least one neuropsychiatric symptom. Apathy (57%) was the most common symptom. The Chinese version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Nursing Home version, showed acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's α for the total scale, frequency, severity, and disturbance subscales were 0.64, 0.70, 0.73, and 0.80, respectively) and test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient for the total scale, frequency, severity, and disturbance subscales were 0.93, 0.92, 0.89, and 0.91, respectively). Five factors-psychomotor behaviour, affective symptoms, psychosis, sleep disorders, and eating disorders-were identified for the total scale. The cluster symptoms aggression and irritability, depression and anxiety, and delusions and hallucinations were three of the optimally stable groups of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the Chinese version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Nursing Home version, is a valid and reliable instrument for evaluating neuropsychiatric symptoms in institutionalized dementia patients.

T1  - Quality of life for up to 18 months after low-energy hip, vertebral, and distal forearm fractures-results from the ICUROS
LA  - eng

AB  - This study used data from the International Costs and Utilities Related to Osteoporotic fractures Study (ICUROS) to estimate the quality of life (QoL) impact of fracture. Hip, vertebral, and distal forearm fractures incur substantial QoL losses. Hip and vertebral fracture results in markedly impaired QoL for at least 18 months. INTRODUCTION: The International Costs and Utilities Related to Osteoporotic fractures Study (ICUROS) is a multinational observational study that aims to describe costs and quality of life (QoL) consequences of osteoporotic fractures. To date, 11 countries have participated in the study: Australia, Austria, Estonia, France, Italy, Lithuania, Mexico, Russia, Spain, the UK, and the USA. The objective of this paper is to describe the QoL impact of hip, vertebral, and distal forearm fracture. METHODS: Data were collected at four time-points for five QoL point estimates: within 2 weeks after fracture (including pre-fracture recall) and at 4, 12, and 18 months after fracture. Quality of life was measured as health state utility values (HSUVs) derived from the EQ-5D-3L. Complete case analysis was conducted as the base case with available case and multiple imputation performed as sensitivity analyses. Multivariate analysis was performed to explore predictors of QoL impact of fracture. RESULTS: Among 5456 patients enrolled using convenience sampling, 3021 patients were eligible for the base case analysis (1415 hip, 1047 distal forearm, and 559 vertebral fractures). The mean (SD) difference between HSUV before and after fracture for hip, vertebral, and distal forearm fracture was estimated at 0.89 (0.40), 0.67 (0.45), and 0.48 (0.34), respectively (p < 0.001 for all fracture types). Eighteen months after fracture, mean HSUVs were lower than before the fracture in patients with hip fracture (0.66 vs. 0.77 p < 0.001) and vertebral fracture (0.70 vs. 0.83 p < 0.001). Hospitalization and higher recalled pre-fracture QoL were associated with increased QoL impact for all fracture types. CONCLUSIONS: Hip, vertebral, and distal forearm fractures incur substantial loss in QoL and for patients with hip or vertebral fracture, QoL is markedly impaired for at least 18 months.

AB  - This research encompasses a factor analysis of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), which involves three groups of midlife women of African descent who reside in the Midwest, the South, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The purpose of the study was to determine the factor structure of the BDI-II when administered to a sample of women aged 40-65 of African descent who reside in the three distinct geographical regions of the United States. A correlational, descriptive design was used, and 536 women of African descent were invited to participate in face-to-face interviews that transpired in community settings. Results of the factor analysis revealed a two-factor explanation. Factor one included symptoms such as punishment feelings and pessimism (cognitive), and the second factor included symptoms such as tiredness and loss of energy (somatic-affective). The application of the Beck Depression Inventory-II among the three groups of women generated specific information about each group and common findings across the groups. Knowledge gained from the research could help to guide specific intervention programs for the three groups of women, and explicate the common approaches that could be used for the three groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Apathy is an important neuropsychiatric feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), which often emerges before the onset of motor symptoms. Patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) have a high probability of developing PD in future. Neuropsychiatric problems are common in RBD, but apathy has not previously been detailed in this key prodromal population. METHODS: Eighty-eight patients with polysomnographically proven RBD, 65 patients with PD and 33 controls were assessed for apathy using the Lille Apathy Rating Scale. Cognition and depression were also quantified. The sensitivity of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale screening questions for apathy and depression was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 46% of patients with RBD were apathetic, compared with 31% of patients with PD in our sample. Most patients with RBD with depression were apathetic but more than half of apathetic patients were not depressed. The sensitivity of the single Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale screening question was only 33% for mild apathy and 50% for severe apathy. CONCLUSIONS: Apathy is common in RBD and is underestimated by a single self-report question. Recognition of apathy as a distinct neuropsychiatric feature in RBD could aid targeted treatment interventions and might contribute to the understanding of prodromal PD.

T1  - Life-space and Related Factors for the Elderly in a Geriatric Health Service Facility
LA  - eng
SN  - 2432-1354
Y1  - 2018/02/03
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate (1) the concurrent validity of the Nursing Home Life-Space Diameter (NHLSD) and the Home-based Life-Space Assessment (Hb-LSA), (2) the correlated factors of life-space, and (3) the factors that affected the NHLSD score for the elderly in a geriatric health service facility, or Roken. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 32 participants in a Roken. Staff members, who had received essential guidance for assessment, examined the cognitive function, physical function, mood, communication ability, objective quality of life, vitality, and daily behavior of the participants. Correlation analysis between NHLSD and other measurements and multiple regression analysis with NHLSD as a dependent variable were conducted. RESULTS: NHLSD and Hb-LSA were significantly correlated (r=0.710, P<0.01). NHLSD was significantly correlated with more measurements than Hb-LSA was; i.e., NHLSD was significantly correlated with communication ability, independence of daily living (Barthel Index; BI), maximum knee extension strength, grip strength, function in daily living, and three QOL measurements: positive affects, ability to communicate, and spontaneity and activity. A stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that the BI total score, the maximum knee extension strength, and spontaneity and activity (one of the QOL items) were significantly correlated with the NHLSD score. CONCLUSIONS: NHLSD can measure the mobility levels of elderly persons in Roken. In addition to physical conditions and dependence of ADLs, spontaneity (or low levels of apathy) may be an important factor for promoting physical activity in Roken.

T1  - Development and Validation of the Symptom Assessment to Improve Symptom Control for Institutionalized Elderly Scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 1538-9375
Y1  - 2018/02/
ET  - 2017/10/15
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To validate a newly developed multiple symptom self-assessment tool in nursing homes. DESIGN: Thirty prevalent symptoms identified in the literature were classified by a 2-round Delphi procedure to a top 10 of the most relevant, burdensome symptoms. Because no existing symptom scale fully covered this top 10, we developed a new scale, consisting of a horizontal numerical scale for the top 10 symptoms, with the possibility to add and rate 3 other symptoms. This scale was validated. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Hundred seventy-four participants, mean age 85 (±5.94) years, were recruited from 7 nursing homes (86%) and 3 acute geriatric wards (14%). METHODS: To test the construct validity, participants with and without a palliative status were enrolled. Participants completed the Symptom Assessment to Improve Symptom Control for Institutionalized Elderly (SATISFIE) scale on day 0 and day 1 (intrarater reliability). Nurses completed the scale on day 0 (inter-rater reliability). Descriptive statistics described the characteristics of the study population and symptom scores. Differences in symptom scores between palliative and nonpalliative participants were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test. Intrarater and inter-rater reliability were calculated by means of an intraclass correlation coefficient. Factor analysis searched for possible symptom clusters. Feasibility was evaluated by measuring the assessment time and by providing a questionnaire for the nurses. RESULTS: In the nonpalliative group (n = 130), the highest self-rated median scores were pain on day 1 [median 3, interquartile range (IQR) 0-5] and pain on day 2. In the palliative group (n = 44), the highest median self-rated scores were fatigue on day 1 [median 5 (IQR 0-6)], lack of energy on day 1 and 2 [both median 5 (IQR 0-8)]; and depressed feeling on day 2 [median 3 (IQR 0-5)]. Nurse assessments median scores were the highest for depressed feeling [median 5 (IQR 1-7)], fatigue [median 4.5 (IQR 0-6.5)], and lack of energy, [median 3 (IQR 0-6)] in the palliative group. In the nonpalliative group, none of the median scores was 3 or more. Intraclass correlation coefficients for intrarater reliability varied between 0.65 and 0.89 and for inter-rater reliability (patients-nurses) between 0.18 and 0.63. Mean assessment time for nurses was 2.0 minutes [standard deviation (SD) = 1.01]. For participants, it decreased from 10.5 minutes (SD = 5.41) at the first assessment to 7.5 minutes (SD = 3.72) at the second assessment. Nurses determined the SATISFIE instrument to be useful, applicable in daily practice, and sufficiently comprehensible for the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The SATISFIE scale is a valid and feasible instrument for regular, multiple symptom assessment in institutionalized older persons.

T1  - Social Dysfunction in Older Age and Relationships with Cognition, Depression, and Apathy: The GreatAGE Study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-8908
Y1  - 2018
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies focused on only one measure of social dysfunction in older age, without proper validation and distinction across different dimensions including subjectivity, structural, and functional aspects. OBJECTIVE: We sought to validate the Social Dysfunction Rating Scale (SDRS) and its factorial structure, also determining the association of SDRS with cognitive functions, global psychopathology, and social deprivation. METHODS: The SDRS was administered to 484 Italian community-dwelling elderly, recruited in the GreatAGE study, a population-based study on aging conducted in Castellana Grotte, Bari, Southern Italy. We determined objective and subjective psychometric properties of SDRS against the gold standard evaluation of social dysfunction according to the Semi-structured Clinical Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) criterion. RESULTS: The SDRS showed a moderate accuracy with an optimal cut-off of 26 maximized with higher sensitivity (0.74,95% CI:0.63-0.84) than specificity (0.57,95% CI:0.50-0.64). A five-factor structure was carried out and five dimensions of SDRS were identified (loneliness; social isolation; feeling of contribution/uselessness; lack of leisure activities; anxiety for the health). Education and global cognitive functions were inversely correlated to SDRS, while a direct association with global psychopathology, depression, and apathy was found. The prevalence of higher SDRS scores was major in subjects with current psychiatric disorders versus other subjects.∥Conclusion: The SDRS could be a valid instrument to capture both size and quality of social dysfunction, both in subjects with psychiatric disorders and in normal subjects. Several categories of social dysfunction differed only in the degree of health deprivation, not in social or material deprivation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of the defining characteristics of the nursing diagnosis for "fatigue in women with breast cancer under radiotherapy". METHOD: Study of diagnostic accuracy, with cross-sectional design, performed in 130 women with breast cancer under radiation treatment. A data collection instrument was used to evaluate clinical socio-demographics and to investigate the presence or absence of defining characteristics for fatigue. The latent class analysis model was applied to assess accuracy measurements of the characteristics identified. RESULTS: Fatigue diagnosis was present in 21.9% of the women. The characteristic which showed the highest sensitivity was "Impaired capacity in maintaining the usual level of physical activity", while "Impaired capacity in maintaining usual routines" and "Lack of interest about the surrounding environment" presented greater specificity. CONCLUSION: Accurate diagnostics allow devising an action plan directed to the patients' real needs.

T1  - The Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia in Down Syndrome (BPSD-DS) Scale: Comprehensive Assessment of Psychopathology in Down Syndrome
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-8908
SN  - 1387-2877
Y1  - 2018
AB  - People with Down syndrome (DS) are prone to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD). Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are core features, but have not been comprehensively evaluated in DS. In a European multidisciplinary study, the novel Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia in Down Syndrome (BPSD-DS) scale was developed to identify frequency and severity of behavioral changes taking account of life-long characteristic behavior. 83 behavioral items in 12 clinically defined sections were evaluated. The central aim was to identify items that change in relation to the dementia status, and thus may differentiate between diagnostic groups. Structured interviews were conducted with informants of persons with DS without dementia (DS, n = 149), with questionable dementia (DS+Q, n = 65), and with diagnosed dementia (DS+AD, n = 67). First exploratory data suggest promising interrater, test-retest, and internal consistency reliability measures. Concerning item relevance, group comparisons revealed pronounced increases in frequency and severity in items of anxiety, sleep disturbances, agitation & stereotypical behavior, aggression, apathy, depressive symptoms, and eating/drinking behavior. The proportion of individuals presenting an increase was highest in DS+AD, intermediate in DS+Q, and lowest in DS. Interestingly, among DS+Q individuals, a substantial proportion already presented increased anxiety, sleep disturbances, apathy, and depressive symptoms, suggesting that these changes occur early in the course of AD. Future efforts should optimize the scale based on current results and clinical experiences, and further study applicability, reliability, and validity. Future application of the scale in daily care may aid caregivers to understand changes, and contribute to timely interventions and adaptation of caregiving.

T1  - Apathy in Parkinson's disease: differences between caregiver's report and self-evaluation
LA  - eng
SN  - 1971-3274
SN  - 0393-5264
Y1  - 2018///Jan/Mar
AB  - Apathy is a state of diminished goal-directed speech, motor activity and emotions. The prevalence of apathy in Parkinson's disease (PD) ranges from 16 to 62%. Several studies have investigated the relationships between apathy and other dimensions of PD, but little is known about possible discrepancies between self-evaluation (SE) and caregiver reporting (CR) of this symptom. The aim of this study is twofold: 1) to investigate the differences in apathy evaluations according to the point of view from which apathy is reported (SE vs CR); 2) to identify the possible relationships between each of the two evaluations (SE and CR) and cognitive and affective dimensions of PD. Forty-eight patients with PD were assessed using the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) in its SE and CR versions (AES-SE and AES-CR); cognitive, affective and behavioral symptoms were also assessed. AES-SE scores were significantly higher than AESCR ones. Neither AES version correlated with depression, whereas both correlated with motor impairment, disease stage and behavioral symptoms. Mini-Mental State Examination and Frontal Assessment Battery scores showed significant negative correlations only with AES-SE scores. Our findings suggest that the point of view from which apathy is seen can lead to significant discrepancies, even when using the same tool. This should be taken into account in order to obtain correct assessment of this disabling and distressing symptom.

T1  - The Progression of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease During a Five-Year Follow-Up: Kuopio ALSOVA Study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-8908
Y1  - 2018
AB  - BACKGROUND: An improved understanding of the role of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently emerged. NPS lead to hospitalization and caregiver stress, but are more variable during the course of the disease than other symptoms. Knowledge about the role of specific NPS in disease progression and prognosis is especially limited. OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between specific NPS and AD severity during a 5-year follow-up period, and to determine which baseline NPS predict AD progression. METHODS: 236 persons with very mild (CDR 0.5) or mild (CDR 1) AD at baseline and their caregivers were followed up for five years as part of the ALSOVA study. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory was used to assess NPS, and AD severity progression was measured with the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes. Data was analyzed with Generalized Estimated Equations and Linear Mixed Models. RESULTS: The baseline NPS that best predicted AD progression were delusions, agitation, and aberrant motor behavior, while AD severity during follow-up was associated with hallucinations, delusions, agitation, apathy, aberrant motor behavior, and sleep and appetite disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Persons with mild AD presenting delusions, agitation, and aberrant motor behavior at the time of diagnosis could have a more rapidly progressing disease, and some NPS are associated with AD severity. These results highlight the importance of evaluating NPS at the time of AD diagnosis, and the need to offer additional support to persons presenting delusions, agitation and aberrant motor behavior, and their caregivers.

LA  - eng
SN  - 1563-5279
Y1  - 2018/01/
ET  - 2017/07/18
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), but little is known about apathy and white matter (WM) change. In this study, we investigated whether fractional anisotropy (FA) of the WM can distinguish apathetic patients from non-apathetic PD patients, and whether the FA value correlates with the severity of apathy in PD. METHODS: Thirty-nine PD patients participated in our study, of which 18 participants were with apathy symptom, and 21 without apathy symptom. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed on all the subjects. RESULTS: Compared to non-apathetic PD patients, the apathetic group had reduced FA values in the genu and body of corpus callosum, bilateral anterior corona radiata, left superior corona radiata and left cingulum. Furthermore, in these WM regions, the FA values were negatively correlated with the Lille Apathy Rating Scale scores in apathetic subjects. CONCLUSION: The WM change is associated with apathy in PD patients. In addition, the FA values of specific regions of WM could be a promising marker to predict the severity of apathy.

T1  - Apathy dimensions in Parkinson's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1099-1166

ET  - 2017/02/28
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Apathy is a prominent and disabling symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) and is a multidimensional behaviour, but which dimensions are specifically affected is unclear. Therefore, the aim of this preliminary study was to determine the psychometric properties of the Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) and explore the multidimensional profile of apathy in PD patients. METHODS: Thirty-four PD patients, with 30 of their informants/carers, and 34 healthy controls, with 30 of their informants, completed the DAS, Apathy Evaluation Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form. Motor staging and independent living status were recorded. RESULTS: Comparative group analyses revealed that PD patients were significantly more apathetic on self-rated executive (p = 0.01) and initiation (p = 0.03) dimensions than controls, where only executive apathy was significantly higher in ratings of patients' informants/carers compared with controls' informants (p = 0.02). A third of patients were impaired on at least one apathy dimension. Additionally, patients with apathy tended to have more impaired activities of daily living, while none of the apathy dimensions related to motor disability. CONCLUSION: Our findings show the DAS is a valid and reliable multidimensional apathy tool for use in PD. PD is characterised by an executive apathy profile as determined by informants/carers, although patients described both executive and initiation apathy. This indicates a lack of motivation for planning, organisation and attention and lack of initiation of thoughts or behaviours.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) frequently entails non-motor symptoms, worsening the course of the disease. Apathy is one of the core neuropsychiatric symptoms that has been investigated in recent years; research is however hampered by the limited availability of well-evaluated apathy scales for these patients. We evaluated the psychometric properties of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) in a sample of PD patients. Psychometric properties, convergent and discriminant validity and sensitivity/specificity were evaluated in patients with (n = 582) or without dementia/depression (n = 339). Internal consistency was high in the entire sample as well as in patients without dementia/depression. Correlations were moderate for convergent validity (UPDRS I item 4: motivation). While apathy could be differentiated from cognitive decline, it was related to depression (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS-15). The overall classification accuracy based on the UPDRS I item 4 was comparable for AES and GDS scores. The AES exhibits good psychometric properties in PD patients with and without dementia and/or depression. Commonly used screenings on the presence of apathy had low detection rates compared to the AES and reflected both apathetic and depressive symptoms. Psychometric evaluation of available instruments will support further research on the clinical relevance of apathy for disease progression and treatment approaches in PD patients.

T1  - A Comprehensive Review of the Quality and Feasibility of Dementia Assessment Measures: The Dementia Outcomes Measurement Suite
LA  - eng
SN  - 1538-9375
Y1  - 2017/10/01
ET  - 2017/03/07
AB  - The diagnosis of dementia and the management of its associated symptoms are aided by high-quality assessment tools. However, there is disagreement on the optimal tools among abundant alternatives and lack of consistent quality standards across the different domains of dementia-related change (ie, cognition, severity, function, behavioral and psychological symptoms, delirium, quality of life). Standardization is difficult because the relevance of a measurement tool for health professionals may depend on the clinical setting and on the dementia type and severity. To address this need, we conducted a comprehensive and clinically relevant evidence-based review of dementia-related tools and present a set of recommended tools, the Dementia Outcomes Measurement Suite. The review revealed that considerable development has occurred in terms of assessment of persons with mild cognitive impairment, executive dysfunction, cognitively mediated functional change, and apathy. More research is needed to develop and validate tools to assess health-related quality of life and specific symptoms of dementia including anxiety, wandering, and repetitive vocalizations. This extensive overview of the quality of different measures may serve as a guide for health professionals clinically and for researchers developing new or improved dementia assessment tools.

T1  - Multidimensional apathy and executive dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

ET  - 2017/07/13
AB  - Apathy and cognitive dysfunction are prominent symptoms of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). More specifically ALS patients show increased Initiation apathy-a lack of motivation for self-generation of thoughts as assessed by the Dimensional Apathy Scale. This study aimed to investigate the cognitive underpinnings of apathy subtypes in ALS. We hypothesized that increased Initiation apathy would be associated deficits on tests of intrinsic response generation, such as verbal fluency. We also explored the relationship of other apathy subtypes to cognitive processes, in particular emotional apathy with emotional and social cognition deficits and executive apathy with planning and goal management deficits. ALS patients, and their carers (N = 30), and healthy matched controls, and their informants (N = 29) were recruited. All participants completed self- and informant/carer-rated Dimensional Apathy Scale, to quantify apathy subtypes (Executive, Emotional and Initiation), along with standard apathy and depression measures. Patients and controls completed the Edinburgh Cognitive and behavioural ALS Screen, and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery including emotional recognition, social cognition, intrinsic response generation tasks (verbal fluency and random number generation) and a new ecologically valid, computerised measure of planning and goal management. The results demonstrated that increased Initiation apathy was the only significantly elevated subtype in ALS (self-rated p < .05, informant/carer-rated p < .01). Initiation apathy was found to be significantly associated with verbal fluency deficit, while Emotional apathy was significantly associated with emotional recognition deficits. No associations were found between apathy subtypes and depression or in controls. This is the first study to show specific associations between apathy subtypes (Emotional and Initiation) and executive and emotional cognitive dysfunction, indicating possible distinct underlying mechanisms to these demotivational symptoms.

T1  - Assessment of apathy minimising the effect of motor dysfunctions in Parkinson's disease: a validation study of the dimensional apathy scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 1573-2649
Y1  - 2017/09/
ET  - 2017/04/07
AB  - PURPOSE: Apathy is associated with motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD); therefore, its evaluation could be influenced by motor disability. The Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) evaluates apathy excluding confounding effects of motor symptoms. The present study had three major aims: (a) to explore the psychometric properties of the DAS in non-demented PD patients; (b) to determine an optimal cut-off score of the DAS to identify apathetic PD patients; and (c) to determine a specific apathy profile in PD patients as compared to healthy controls (HC). METHODS: One hundred and seven PD patients and 100 HC completed the DAS. To explore convergent and divergent validity of the DAS in PD, patients underwent the Apathy Evaluation Scale and tools for assessing depressive symptoms, anxiety and cognition. Clinical aspects were recorded. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were carried out to estimate the optimal cut-off score to identify clinically significant apathy. RESULTS: The DAS scores showed high internal consistency and good evidence for convergent and discriminant validity. Maximum discrimination between apathetic and non-apathetic patients was obtained with a cut-off score of 28.5 (total score range: 0-72 with higher score indicating more severe apathy). Comparison between PD and HC groups revealed significant differences on total DAS, behavioural/cognitive initiation and emotional subscales. CONCLUSIONS: The DAS is a valid and reliable tool to assess multidimensional apathy in PD, independently of severity of motor symptoms. Reduced initiation of thought and behaviour and emotional blunting characterised PD patients, without confounding effects of motor disability.

T1  - Personality, dopamine, and Parkinson's disease: Insights from subthalamic stimulation
LA  - eng
SN  - 1531-8257
Y1  - 2017/08/
ET  - 2017/06/23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subthalamic stimulation improves the motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, the impact of this treatment on impulse control and personality is the subject of heavy debate. The objective of this study was to investigate personality changes after subthalamic stimulation. METHODS: Using Cloninger's biosocial model, we assessed personality in 73 Parkinson's disease patients before and 12 months after subthalamic stimulation accompanied by a drastic reduction in dopaminergic medication. Changes in psychobehavioral symptoms were measured using a battery of validated clinical scales (apathy, depression, anxiety, hyperemotionality, mania, psychosis, punding, and impulse control behaviors). RESULTS: One year after surgery, the harm avoidance personality domain total score increased compared with the baseline (+2.8; 34 patients; P < 0.001), as did 3 of its 4 subdomains: anticipatory worry (+0.7; 10 patients; P = 0.005), shyness (+0.6; 7 patients; P = 0.03), and fatigability (+1.1; 10 patients; P = 0.0014). Evolution of the shyness personality trait correlated with the decrease in dopaminergic medication. Total scores in the other personality domains remained unchanged, except for extravagance, a subdomain of novelty seeking, and persistence, a subdomain of reward dependence, which both decreased following surgery (-0.3; 7 patients; and -0.6; 9 patients; P = 0.03 and P = 0.0019, respectively). Although apathy increased, other psychobehavioral symptoms, including impulse control behaviors and neuropsychiatric nonmotor fluctuations, improved. Depression and anhedonia remained stable. Scores in hypodopaminergia and neuropsychiatric nonmotor OFF correlated with harm avoidance. Scores in hyperdopaminergia and neuropsychiatric nonmotor ON correlated with novelty seeking. CONCLUSIONS: When subthalamic stimulation is applied in Parkinson's disease, significant changes in personality traits are observed, which may be related to postoperative tapering of dopaminergic treatment. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

T1  - Psychometric testing of a Swedish version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 1502-4725
Y1  - 2017/08/
ET  - 2017/06/20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy, a prevalent and clinically relevant symptom in neurodegenerative disease, is often evaluated by the instrument Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). However, this instrument has not been translated into Swedish, halting clinical and research efforts. Furthermore, previous studies lack analyses of some basic properties, such as the legitimacy of a total score, or have analysed dimensionality by questionable methods. AIM: To translate and psychometrically evaluate a Swedish version of the AES. METHOD: The AES was translated, and its psychometric properties were tested in the Swedish BioFINDER study, including cognitively well elderly, and subjects with mild cognitive or parkinsonian symptoms. Psychometric analyses were conducted according to classical test theory (CTT) and aimed to resemble those performed in the English original study by Marin et al. in 1991. Dimensionality was additionally analysed on a matrix of polychoric correlations and parallel analyses. RESULTS: Data indicate that the Swedish AES performs satisfactorily regarding data completeness, scaling assumptions, targeting, and reliability. Principal component analyses (with parallel analysis) of polychoric correlation matrices identified a single component. Convergent and discriminative validity correlations accorded with a priori expectations. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides initial support that this Swedish AES performs similarly to the English original, and exhibits acceptable psychometric properties according to CTT, including supported unidimensionality, and may be adopted for use in clinical and research settings.

T1  - Apathy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: insights from Dimensional Apathy Scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 2167-9223
Y1  - 2017/08/
ET  - 2017/04/21
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Apathy is associated with cognitive decline and worse survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); an accurate evaluation of this aspect is relevant in clinical settings. The aims of this study are to evaluate the prevalence of apathy in a large ALS sample, using published diagnostic criteria, and to explore the psychometric properties, the sensitivity and the specificity of the Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) as a screening tool for apathy. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-one patients underwent clinical interview based on diagnostic criteria for apathy, DAS, Apathy Evaluation Scale, and assessment of depression, global cognitive functioning, and non-verbal intelligence. RESULTS: According to diagnostic criteria, apathy occurred in 28.2% of the patients. The DAS showed high consistency, convergent, and discriminant validities. Apathetic and non-apathetic patients significantly differed on total DAS and executive and Behavioral/Cognitive Initiation subscales, indicating good criterion validity. Receiver operating characteristics analysis, considering diagnostic criteria for apathy as gold standard, revealed that a score of 26/27 was an optimal cut-off score for the identification of apathy. CONCLUSIONS: The DAS is a valid screening tool for apathy and its aspects in ALS through limiting the impact of physical disability. Executive and behavioral/cognitive aspects of apathy, rather than emotional aspects, are more frequent in ALS.

T1  - Development of a caregiver-reported measure to support systematic assessment of people with dementia in long-term care: The Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale for Dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 1477-030X
Y1  - 2017/07/
ET  - 2016/10/25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptom burden is common for long-term care residents with dementia which if untreated compromises quality of life. Measurement tools can support assessment of symptoms and problems but are not widely used in long-term care settings. We developed the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale for Dementia derived from the Palliative care Outcome Scale, Palliative care Outcome Scale-Symptom and Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale. AIM: To examine the content validity, acceptability and comprehension of Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale for Dementia for routine use in long-term care settings for people with dementia and to refine Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale for Dementia. DESIGN: A multi-method qualitative study consisting of focus groups, semi-structured interviews and cognitive interviews. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Three residential long-term care settings in London, UK. Focus group and semi-structured interview participants included caregiver staff, family, general practitioners and district nurses. Caregiver staff were sampled purposively for cognitive interviews. RESULTS: A total of 26 respondents participated in the focus groups ( n = 21) or semi-structured interviews ( n = 5) and 10 caregiver staff completed cognitive interviews. Additional symptoms and problems included agitation, wandering, sleep problems, communication problems and diarrhoea. Refinements or lay terms were required to improve comprehension and consistency of item response for nausea, drowsiness, delusions/hallucinations, agitation, loss of interest, communication problems and interaction. A video presentation was required to support comprehension of instructions and assessment of verbally compromised residents. CONCLUSION: Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale for Dementia is a comprehensive and acceptable caregiver-reported measure to detect symptoms and problems in dementia. It is suitable for caregiver staff without professional training as it has been refined and tailored to maximise caregiver expertise, ready for further psychometric testing.

T1  - IRT Analysis of the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale: Identifying the Best Items for Use with Geriatric Patients in Primary Care
LA  - eng
SN  - 1545-2301
Y1  - 2017///Jul-Sep
ET  - 2017/01/12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) (Grace & Malloy, 2001) assesses behavioral dysfunction associated with frontal-subcortical damage; it is often used to measure these indicators of executive dysfunction in older adults with possible dementia. Although prior research supports the FrSBe's clinical utility and factorial validity, little attempt has been made to examine which items are most useful for geriatric cases. The goal of the present study is to identify these items. METHOD: Data from 304 older patients referred for neuropsychological assessment were used to examine the FrSBe's three subscales: Apathy (A; 14 items), Executive Dysfunction (E; 17 items), and Disinhibition (D; 15 items). Item properties were investigated using the Graded Response Model, a two-parameter polytomous item response theory model. RESULTS: Difficulty parameters, discrimination parameters, and information curves identified 18 items that effectively discriminate (a ≥ 1.70) between levels of behavioral dysfunction and measure a range of dysfunction (b(A): -1.23 - 2.22; b(D): -.29 - 2.14; b(E): -1.81 - 1.77). CONCLUSIONS: Most FrSBe items were effective at discriminating various levels of behavioral dysfunction, though weaker items were identified. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The findings suggest the FrSBe is a useful clinical tool when working with a geriatric population, though some items provide more information than others.

T1  - Distinguishing subtypes of extrinsic motivation among people with mild to borderline intellectual disability
LA  - eng
SN  - 1365-2788
Y1  - 2017/07/
ET  - 2017/02/10
AB  - BACKGROUND: According to self-determination theory, motivation is ordered in types, including amotivation, extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation. Self-determination theory defines four subtypes of extrinsic motivation: external motivation, introjected motivation, identified motivation and integrated motivation. Although it has been argued theoretically that the different types of motivation are universally applicable, Reid et al. () proposed a dichotomy of broad subtypes of extrinsic motivation for people with intellectual disability (ID) due to their cognitive limitations. The current study challenges this proposal by testing whether the four subtypes of extrinsic motivation can be differentiated among people with ID as well. METHOD: The subtypes of extrinsic motivation were measured using two adapted versions of the Self-Regulation Questionnaire, one regarding exercise and one regarding support. In total, 186 adults with mild to borderline ID participated in the study. RESULTS: Results supported the distinction between the four subtypes of extrinsic motivation regarding both exercise and support. In addition, the correlation coefficients supported a quasi-simplex pattern of correlations among the subtypes, indicating that adjacent subtypes were more closely related than non-adjacent subtypes. Moreover, the study showed sufficient Cronbach's alphas and test-retest reliabilities for early stage research. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results of the current study provide initial evidence for the universality of the four subtypes of extrinsic motivation across populations with and without ID.

T1  - Cognitive screening and behavioural observation of functional ability in patients with multiple episode schizophrenia: an exploratory study
LA  - eng
SN  - 2044-6055
Y1  - 2017/06/23
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the usability of a neuropsychological screening instrument and two observation scales of everyday behaviour to describe cognitive and functional capacity of patients with multiepisode schizophrenia and considerable care needs, who frequently refuse to participate in cognitive testing or performance-based functional measurement. SETTING: One psychiatric unit specialised in severe mental illness at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: Patients were included consecutively from date of admission to the unit. INCLUSION CRITERIA: age 18-65 years, International Classification of Diseases 10 diagnoses F20.0-F20.9 (schizophrenia) or F25.0-F25.9 (schizoaffective disorder) since at least 5 years. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: acute serious psychotic episodes or physical illness, alcohol or drug abuse during the year before the study, diagnosed cerebral disorder at admission to the unit, and insufficient ability to speak Swedish. 64 patients filled the criteria and 19 accepted participation: 14 males, 5 females, median age 56 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: Barrow Neurological Institute Screen for Higher Cerebral Functions (BNIS) scores, measured by a psychologist; Frontal Systems Behaviour Scale (FrSBe) Family Version and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) V.4.0 scores, measured by nursing staff. Non-parametric statistics were consistently applied to process the data. RESULTS: Failure analysis showed differences regarding gender and subdiagnoses between participants and non-participants. All participants had BNIS scores indicating cognitive dysfunction. FrSBe group medians showed apathy and executive problems, indicating possible frontal lobe disturbance. FIM showed dependency on others for linguistic and social communication, everyday problem solving, and remembering persons and daily routines. Correlations between FrSBe and FIM (p≤0.01) suggested executive dysfunction being crucial to explain difficulties in performing activities of daily functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Indications of considerable cognitive and functional difficulties found among the participants suggestedthat the instruments are clinically applicable for tentative assessment of cognitive and functional ability among patients with multiepisode schizophrenia and considerable care needs.

T1  - Assessing the Usefulness and Validity of Frailty Markers in Critically Ill Adults
LA  - eng
SN  - 2325-6621
SN  - 2329-6933
Y1  - 2017/06/
AB  - RATIONALE: Identifying frailty by the presence of a critical number of frailty markers has been difficult to operationalize in the intensive care unit (ICU), where patients often cannot complete performance measures or answer complex questions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the construct and predictive validity of a questionnaire-based approach to identifying frailty in adult ICU patients. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of adults admitted to a medical or surgical ICU at one of two hospitals in New York. We asked patients or surrogates about demographic information, frailty markers, and prehospital disability status. ICU physicians completed the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), a judgment-based frailty assessment tool. We examined the relationship between individual frailty markers, CFS, and demographic correlates of frailty such as age, prehospital living arrangement, and prehospital disability. We assessed the predictive validity of possible frailty phenotypes, using hospital and 6-month outcomes. RESULTS: Among 95 study participants (mean age [SD], 57.1 [17.5] yr), 80% reported one or more of seven frailty markers (median [interquartile range], 3 [1-4]). The most common frailty markers were impaired mobility (60%), impaired physical activity (60%), and decreased strength (44.2%). Patients with more frailty markers were older (mean age [SD] of those with at least three frailty markers: 62.3 [17.7] vs. 51.6 [15.8] yr; P < 0.001) compared with those with fewer than three markers, and were more likely to be judged frail by CFS (57.0 vs. 19.6%; P = 0.001), although of the 49 patients with three or more frailty markers, CFS identified 36.7% as not frail. Malnutrition and fatigue or low energy were not significantly associated with other frailty correlates. Survivors with more frailty markers were more likely to die or report increased disability at follow-up. In multivariate models, a frailty phenotype defined as at least three of the seven frailty markers performed similarly to CFS in predicting death or increased disability at 6 months (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 3.3 [1.2-9.0] vs. 3.8 [1.2-11.7]) for CFS. CONCLUSIONS: Asking patients or surrogates about frailty markers may be a valid approach to identifying critically ill adults with a frailty phenotype associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes. Larger studies measuring frailty markers may provide insight into factors that impact short- and long-term outcomes after ICU admission.

T1  - Symptoms of Apathy Independently Predict Incident Frailty and Disability in Community-Dwelling Older Adults
LA  - eng
SN  - 1555-2101
SN  - 0160-6689
Y1  - 2017/05/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although depressive symptoms are widely recognized as a predictor of functional decline among older adults, little is known about the predictive utility of apathy in this population. We prospectively examined apathy symptoms as predictors of incident slow gait, frailty, and disability among non-demented, community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: We examined 2 independent prospective cohort studies-the LonGenity study (N = 625, 53% women, mean age = 75.2 years) and the Central Control of Mobility in Aging (CCMA) study (N = 312, 57% women, mean age = 76.4 years). Individuals were recruited from 2008 to 2014. Apathy was assessed using 3 items from the Geriatric Depression Scale. Slow gait was defined as 1 standard deviation or more below age- and sex-adjusted mean values, frailty was defined using the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria, and disability was assessed with a well-validated disability scale. RESULTS: The prevalence of apathy was 20% in the LonGenity cohort and 26% in the CCMA cohort. The presence of apathy at baseline, independent of depressive symptoms (besides apathy), increased the risk of developing incident slow gait (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.10; 95% CI, 1.36-3.24; P = .001), frailty (HR = 2.86; 95% CI, 1.96-4.16; P < .001), and disability (HR = 3.43; 95% CI, 1.73-6.79; P < .001) in the pooled sample. These associations remained significant when accounting for demographics, medical illnesses, and cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: Apathy is associated with increased risk of developing slow gait, frailty, and disability, independent of other established risk factors, in non-demented older adults. Apathy should be screened for as a potentially preventable cause of functional decline in clinical psychiatric settings.

T1  - Validity of the three apathy items of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-3A) in measuring apathy in older persons
LA  - eng
SN  - 1099-1166
Y1  - 2017/04/
ET  - 2016/04/07
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)-3A, a three-item subset of the GDS-15, is increasingly used as a measure for apathy in research settings to assess factors associating with this neuropsychiatric syndrome. We aimed to assess how accurately the GDS-3A discriminates between presence and absence of apathy in two populations of community-dwelling older persons, using the Apathy Scale as reference standard. METHODS: Baseline data were used from 427 participants of the Discontinuation of Antihypertensive Treatment in Elderly people (DANTE) Study Leiden and 1118 participants of the PROactive Management Of Depression in the Elderly (PROMODE) Study, all ≥75 years and with available GDS-3A and Apathy Scale measurements. A cut-off score of ≥14 was used for presence of apathy according to the Apathy Scale. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. Based on the likelihood ratios for GDS-3A scores, a cut-off of ≥2 was used for presence of apathy according to the GDS-3A to calculate test characteristics. RESULTS: The AUC was 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.62-0.73) in the DANTE Study and 0.72 (0.67-0.77) in the PROMODE Study. In the DANTE Study sensitivity was 29.3% (21.4-38.1) and specificity was 88.5% (84.4-91.8), whereas in the PROMODE Study sensitivity was 32.8% (24.5-41.1) and specificity 92.6% (90.9-94.2). Stratification on population characteristics did not yield more favourable test characteristics. CONCLUSION: The GDS-3A has low sensitivity and high specificity as a measure of apathy in two populations of older persons. Using the GDS-3A in research might yield estimates biassed towards the null in case of non-differential misclassification. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - Cognitive Testing in Patients with CKD: The Problem of Missing Cases

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cognitive testing is only valid in individuals with sufficient visual and motor skills and motivation to participate. Patients on dialysis usually suffer from limitations, such as impaired vision, motor difficulties, and depression. Hence, it is doubtful that the true value of cognitive functioning can be measured without bias. Consequently, many patients are excluded from cognitive testing. We focused on reasons for exclusion and analyzed characteristics of nontestable patients. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS & MEASUREMENTS: Within the Choice of Renal Replacement Therapy Project (baseline survey: May 2014 to May 2015), n=767 patients on peritoneal dialysis (n=240) or hemodialysis (n=527) were tested with the Trail Making Test-B and the German d2-Revision Test and completed the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form cognition subscale. We divided the sample into patients with missing cognitive testing data and patients with full cognitive testing data, analyzed reasons for nonfeasibility, and compared subsamples with regard to psychosocial and physical metrics. The exclusion categories were linked to patient characteristics potentially associated with missing data (age, comorbidity, depression, and education level) by calculation of λ-coefficient. RESULTS: The subsamples consisted of n=366 (48%) patients with missing data (peritoneal dialysis =62, hemodialysis =304) and n=401 patients with full cognitive testing data (peritoneal dialysis =178, hemodialysis =223). Patients were excluded due to visual impairment (49%), lack of motivation (31%), and motor impairment (13%). The remaining 8% did not follow instructions, suffered from medical incidents, or had language difficulties. Compared with patients with full cognitive testing data, they were more likely to have depression; be treated with hemodialysis; be older, nonworking, or more comorbid; and experience poorer shared decision making. Reasons for exclusion were not related to levels of age, comorbidity score, depression score, or education level. CONCLUSIONS: We excluded almost one half of eligible patients from cognitive testing due to visual, motivational, or motor difficulties. Our findings are consistent with exclusion categories reported from the literature. We should be aware that, because of disease-related limitations, conclusions about cognitive functioning in the CKD population may be biased. In the future, nonvisual and nonverbal cognitive testing can be a valuable resource.

T1  - Development and validation of the deep brain stimulation impairment scale (DBS-IS)
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-5126
Y1  - 2017/03/
ET  - 2017/01/06
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) has considerable influence on motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). While improvements in motor functioning can be easily assessed with general quality of life questionnaires, the measurement of specific STN-DBS-associated impairments often remains insufficient. Hence, we aimed to develop a questionnaire that measures STN-DBS-related impairments. METHODS: The development of the (STN-)DBS Impairment Scale (DBS-IS) consisted of four steps. First, 30 semi-structured interviews before, three and twelve months after STN-DBS-surgery were performed to create 76 items that relate to motor and non-motor functioning in STN-DBS PD patients. Second, pilot-testing led to a rewording of the questions for better understanding. Third, a first multicentre survey was performed to reduce items by applying principal component analysis (PCA). Fourth, a second multicentre survey was conducted to examine factor structure, reliability (internal consistency) and validity. RESULTS: After the first survey (N = 215), the PCA lead to a reduction of 54 items. After the second survey (N = 391), exploratory factor analysis determined six factors with 22 items: 1. Postural instability and gait difficulties (5 items), 2. Cognitive impairment (5 items), 3. Speaking problems (3 items), 4. Apathy (3 items), 5. Impulsivity (3 items), and 6. Difficulties related to the DBS device (3 items). High reliability was reported for all subscales (Cronbach's alpha 0.71-0.90). Similarly, construct validity was high (r > 0.50, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: With this new questionnaire patients can be followed-up and STN-DBS-specific problems might be adequately measured. Also, comparisons between patients with and without STN-DBS might be possible.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric Predictors of Cognitive Decline in Parkinson Disease: A Longitudinal Study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1545-7214
Y1  - 2017/03/
ET  - 2016/10/12
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between anxiety, depression, apathy, and cognitive decline in Parkinson disease (PD). DESIGN: Longitudinal study design to assess whether specific neuropsychiatric, demographic, and clinical features predict future cognitive decline. SETTING: Veterans Affairs San Diego Medical Center and the University of California, San Diego. PARTICIPANTS: PD patients (N = 68) and healthy controls (N = 30). MEASUREMENTS: Participants were administered self-report measures of depression (Geriatric Depression Scale), anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Scale), and apathy (Apathy Scale), and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery assessing attention, language, visuospatial function, verbal and visual learning and memory, and executive function. Participants were tested at baseline and after an approximate 2-year period. RESULTS: Anxiety and depression at baseline were the strongest predictors of longitudinal decline on measures of verbal and visual learning, over and above other clinical and demographic characteristics. However, baseline neuropsychiatric symptoms did not significantly correlate with decline in other cognitive domains. No significant correlations were detected between neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognition in the healthy control group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that anxiety and depression in PD may be risk factors for subsequent declines in learning. Emerging evidence suggests nonmotor symptoms are critical determinants of PD prognosis, and the results of this study highlight the importance of assessment of depression and anxiety early in PD.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia may predict caregiver burden: a Sicilian exploratory study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1479-8301
Y1  - 2017/03/
ET  - 2016/07/13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia are very common. They represent a main cause of burden and distress in caregivers and can lead to early institutionalization of patients. We aimed to find the most specific behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia that can strongly affect the caregivers' burden. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients and their caregivers were enrolled in this study. All of the patients were affected by Alzheimer's, vascular, or frontotemporal dementia and were evaluated with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Mini-Mental State Examination. Caregivers were administered the Caregiver Burden Inventory. RESULTS: Apathy, depression, anxiety, and agitation were the most common symptoms and were found in up to 90% of the patients. We detected strong correlations between patient neuropsychiatric symptoms, (i.e. irritability, hallucinations, aberrant motor behavioural, depression, and agitation) and Caregiver Burden Inventory scores. Multiple regression analysis found hallucinations, irritability, and depression to be significant predictors of caregiver burden. Moreover, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory score was more closely related to caregiver burden than the Mini-Mental State Examination score. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that demented patients' behavioural problems are related to the level of caregiver burden and distress. Further investigations are needed to differentiate the present findings among dementia subtypes and to better evaluate the effect of caregivers' personal characteristics on their own burden.

AB  - Apathy is well described in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by motor disability; therefore, assessment of apathy avoiding possible confounding effects of motor impairments is necessary in neurological diseases. Recently, the Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) was developed to assess apathy as multifaceted construct, independent of physical disability. We developed the Italian version of the Dimensional Apathy Scale (I-DAS) and explored its psychometric properties in a sample of 309 healthy individuals. Participants also completed Apathy Evaluation Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised. The I-DAS showed high internal consistency, good convergent and divergent validity. The I-DAS had a three-factor structure, such as the original scale. The I-DAS scored was significantly correlated with individuals' education, but not with age or gender. We, therefore, computed correction factor for education and provided percentile distribution of the adjusted scores to identify individuals with high levels of apathy. The I-DAS showed good psychometric properties and can be a valid and reliable tool to assess multidimensional apathy.

T1  - Distinct Subtypes of Apathy Revealed by the Apathy Motivation Index
LA  - eng
SN  - 1932-6203
Y1  - 2017/01/11
AB  - Apathy is a debilitating but poorly understood disorder characterized by a reduction in motivation. As well as being associated with several brain disorders, apathy is also prevalent in varying degrees in healthy people. Whilst many tools have been developed to assess levels of apathy in clinical disorders, surprisingly there are no measures of apathy suitable for healthy people. Moreover, although apathy is commonly comorbid with symptoms of depression, anhedonia and fatigue, how and why these symptoms are associated is unclear. Here we developed the Apathy-Motivation Index (AMI), a brief self-report index of apathy and motivation. Using exploratory factor analysis (in a sample of 505 people), and then confirmatory analysis (in a different set of 479 individuals), we identified subtypes of apathy in behavioural, social and emotional domains. Latent profile analyses showed four different profiles of apathy that were associated with varying levels of depression, anhedonia and fatigue. The AMI is a novel and reliable measure of individual differences in apathy and might provide a useful means of probing different mechanisms underlying sub-clinical lack of motivation in otherwise healthy individuals. Moreover, associations between apathy and comorbid states may be reflective of problems in different emotional, social and behavioural domains.

AB  - AIM: To study apathetic depression first diagnosed at late age and identify its relation to cognitive and social dysfunction as well as to morphological and functional changes in the brain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients at the age above 60 years with newly diagnosed depressive episode and 15 healthy age-matched volunteers were included in the study. All patients were divided into two groups by the score on the Apathy scale (AS): >14 - depression with apathy (n=21), <14 - depression without apathy (n=11). Patients were examined using psychometric methods (HAMD, GDS, AS, SHAPS, SF-36, MoCA-test), neuroimaging (MRI scanner with a magnetic field strength of 1.5 Tesla - EXCEL ART Vantage Atlas-X, Toshiba, Japan) and statistical data analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Apathy component in clinical depression reflects a tendency towards the increase in depression severity and cognitive deterioration that results in the substantial lowering of quality of life and correlates with cerebrovascular changes, decrease in gray and white matter volume and mean cortical thickness of large hemispheres.

T1  - A Novel Assessment and Profiling of Multidimensional Apathy in Alzheimer's Disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-8908
Y1  - 2017
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a complex multidimensional syndrome frequently reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated with impaired awareness. Here we present a psychometrically robust method to profile apathy in AD. OBJECTIVES: To determine the validity and reliability of a multidimensional apathy measure, the Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS), and explore the apathy subtype profile and its associations in AD. METHODS: 102 people with AD and 55 healthy controls were recruited. Participants completed the DAS, the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), Geriatric Depression Short form (GDS-15), and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (LIADL). Psychometric properties of the DAS were determined. AD-Control comparison was performed to explore group differences on the DAS. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to explore the profile of apathy in AD. RESULTS: The DAS had a good to excellent Cronbach's standardized alpha (self-rated = 0.85, informant/carer-rated = 0.93) and good convergent and divergent validity against standard apathy (AES) and depression (GDS-15) measures. Group comparison showed people with AD were significantly higher for all apathy subtypes than controls (p < 0.001), and lacking in awareness over all apathy subtype deficits. LCA showed three distinct AD subgroups, with 42.2% in the Executive-Initiation apathy, 28.4% in the Global apathy, and 29.4% in the Minimal apathy group. CONCLUSIONS: The DAS is a psychometrically robust method of assessing multidimensional apathy in AD. The apathy profiles in AD are heterogeneous, with additional specific impairments relating to awareness dependent on apathy subtype.

T1  - Informant-Reported Cognitive Decline and Activity Engagement across Four Years in a Community Sample
LA  - eng
SN  - 1423-0003
Y1  - 2017
ET  - 2017/06/09
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subtle age-related cognitive decline may be associated with the capacity to remain engaged in mental, physical, and social activities. Informant reports of cognitive decline potentially provide additional information to psychometric tests on change in everyday cognitive function relevant to activity engagement. OBJECTIVE: To investigate relations between decline in everyday cognitive function as assessed by informant report and activity engagement in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: A sample of cognitively normal older adults was drawn from the 2 latest waves of the PATH Through Life Study (n = 1,391; mean age 74.5 ± 1.5, 48.4% female). PATH is a 16-year longitudinal cohort study set in the Canberra/Queanbeyan district, Australia. Assessments were carried out at baseline, and at 3 subsequent time-points 4 years apart. At wave-4, the IQCODE, an informant measure of 4-year cognitive decline was provided by a spouse, family member, or friend of each participant. Activity engagement was assessed by the abbreviated RIASEC Mental Activity List, self-reported frequency and duration of physical activity (Whitehall Questionnaire) and the Lubben Social Network Scale that assessed interaction with family/friends. Participants provided demographic information, self-reported health status (SF-12), and responses to the Goldberg Depression Scale. The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) were used to measure objective 4-year cognitive change. Those with MMSE score of ≤27 were excluded. RESULTS: IQCODE score predicted disengagement from mental activities over 4 years in cognitively healthy adults (β = -0.056, standard error [SE] = 0.019, p = 0.004). This association was robust to covariate control and change on the SDMT which was also significantly related to mental activity disengagement. In models adjusted for change scores on the SDMT and the CVLT, the IQCODE was associated with less physical (β = -0.692, SE = 0.24, p = 0.004) and social engagement (β -0.046, SE = 0.021, p = 0.032), but relationships were attenuated with the inclusion of covariates. CONCLUSION: Informant-reported cognitive decline in a non-clinical sample was linked to activities that support cognitive health. Associations were robust to adjustment for cognitive change scores. Utilising informant reports prior to the manifestation of clinically relevant decline may identify those who would benefit most from personalised activity interventions.

T1  - Measuring Fatigue Using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20: A Questionable Factor Structure in Haemodialysis Patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 2235-3186
Y1  - 2017
ET  - 2017/02/28
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Fatigue is recognised as a common and burdensome symptom among dialysis patients. A growing body of research is devoted to understanding fatigue in advanced kidney disease, yet its measurement is challenging within this context. Our aim was to evaluate the factor structure underlying the multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI-20) and to examine its associations with clinical factors and mood. METHODS: Data was evaluated for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) from the screening phase of a multicentre randomised placebo-controlled trial of sertraline in haemodialysis (HD) patients. Four hundred seventy patients completed the MFI-20, which purports to measure 5 components of fatigue (general fatigue, mental fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced motivation and reduced activity). CFA models were evaluated in MPlus 7.3 using the robust maximum likelihood (MLR) estimation. RESULTS: The evaluation of the original 5 factors revealed low internal reliability for the general factor and reduced activity, and high intercorrelations between all sum scores. CFA revealed poor model fit for the original 5-factor MFI-20 model (confirmatory fit index = 0.738; Tucker-Lewis index = 0.689; root mean squared error of approximation = 0.101). Alternative models, including 1, 3 and bi-factor models all demonstrated poor fit to the data. No reliable factor model was confirmed prohibiting the examination of factors associated with fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: We were not able to confirm the factor structure of the MFI-20 in a large sample of HD patients. Certain items may lack suitable face validity in this context.

T1  - A Multicentre Italian Validation Study in Aging Adults with Down Syndrome and Other Forms of Intellectual Disabilities: Dementia Screening Questionnaire for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-5828
Y1  - 2017
AB  - BACKGROUND: The USA National Task Group (NTG) guidelines advocate the use of an adapted version of Dementia Screening Questionnaire for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (DSQIID) for dementia screening of individuals with Down syndrome (DS) and with other forms of ID (non-DS). OBJECTIVE: In order to meet these guidelines, this study verifies the psychometric properties of an Italian version of the original DSQIID in a population composed of adults aged 40 years and over with DS and non-DS ID. METHODS: Internal consistency, inter-rater and intra-rater reliabilities, structural validity, convergent validity and known group differences of DSQIID-I were assessed with 200 individuals with ID (mean of 55.2 years; range: 40-80 years) recruited from 15 different centers in Italy. Diagnosis of dementia was done according to IASSID diagnostic criteria and its degree of clinical certainty was defined according to Silverman et al.'s classification (2004). RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha for the DSQIID-I was 0.94. The ICCs for inter-rater and test-retest reliability were both 0.89. A Principal Component analysis revealed three domains, namely memory and confusion- related items, motor and functional disabilities, depression and apathy, which explained almost 40% of the overall variance. The total DSQIID-I score correlated significantly with DMR and differed significantly among those individuals (n = 34) with cognitive decline from those without (n = 166). Age, gender and severity of ID were unrelated to the DSQIID-I. CONCLUSION: The present study confirms the cross-cultural value of DSQIID which was proved to be a psychometrically valid and user-friendly observer-rated scale for dementia screening in adults with both DS and non-DS ID.

AB  - CONTEXT: Patients with incurable cancer engage in several coping styles to manage the impact of cancer and its treatment. The Brief COPE is a widely used measure intended to capture multiple and distinct types of coping. The Brief COPE has not been validated among patients with incurable cancer. OBJECTIVES: We sought to validate seven subscales of the Brief COPE in a large sample of patients newly diagnosed with incurable lung and noncolorectal gastrointestinal cancers (N = 350). METHODS: Participants completed the Brief COPE and measures assessing quality of life (QOL) (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General) and psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) within eight weeks of diagnosis of incurable cancer. We evaluated the psychometric properties of the Brief COPE using a confirmatory factor analysis and tests of correlation with the QOL and distress scales. RESULTS: The Brief COPE factors were consistent with the original subscales, although the Behavioral Disengagement Scale had low internal consistency. Factors showed anticipated relationships with QOL and distress measures, except emotional support coping, which was correlated with increased depression and anxiety. We also conducted an exploratory high-order factor analysis to determine if subscales' score variances grouped together. The high-order factor analysis resulted in two factors, with active, emotional support, positive reframing, and acceptance loading onto one factor and denial and self-blame loading onto the second. CONCLUSION: The selected subscales of the Brief COPE are appropriate measures of coping among individuals newly diagnosed with incurable lung and gastrointestinal cancers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Coping Strategies Inventory-Short Form (CSI-SF) measures four coping strategies based on 16 items: 4 items each indicating problem- vs. emotion-focused engagement or disengagement. Here we provide the first assessment of reliability and construct validity of the CSI-SF among hemodialysis patients across 13 countries. METHODS: The CSI-SF was completed by patients in 9 languages in phase 4 of the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (2009-11). Cronbach's alpha was used to assess internal consistency. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were applied to assess the factor structure of the CSI-SF by country and language. CSI-SF data were analyzed from 7201 patients (60% male; median age 62.5 [range 18-96] years). RESULTS: Good internal consistency (α=0.56-0.80) was seen for three scales in English (US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand), German, and Swedish versions. The fourth scale was internally consistent if two items were dropped. In these countries, both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated a factor structure consistent with the four CSI-SF scales. Other language versions showed a factor structure inconsistent with these four scales. CONCLUSION: The slightly modified English, German, and Swedish versions of the CSI-SF are reliable and valid instruments for measuring coping strategies in hemodialysis patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cluster headache (CH) is a rare, excruciating and highly disabling primary headache disorder. Using non cluster headache specific measures, previous studies have shown that CH has a significant negative impact on patients' quality of life (QoL), but a CH-specific QoL scale is currently unavailable. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop and validate a CH-specific QoL scale. METHODS: Based on a literature review, semi-structured patient interviews and expert panel consultation, we produced a 54-item questionnaire, which was pre-tested in a sample of CH patients and subsequently reduced to 47 items. The revised scale was then administered to CH sufferers attending a tertiary headache clinic and those registered with a patient group. A total of 406 completed questionnaires were received. To assess test-retest reliability, a subsample (N = 56) completed the scale on a second occasion, two weeks after the first. Standard statistical methods were used to analyse the data for validity and reliability. RESULTS: Item reduction and exploratory factor analysis led to 28-items, grouped into four subscales labelled "restriction of activities of daily living", "impact on mood and interpersonal relationships", "pain and anxiety", and "lack of vitality". The final CH-specific QoL scale, the CHQ, demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha > 0.9) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient > 0.8), with good internal construct validity between subscales (range 0.52-0.75) and convergent validity with other QoL measures. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated the first patient-reported outcome measure of QoL specifically for CH sufferers, which may be used to monitor QoL in clinical care and research.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric characteristics of PiB-negative subcortical vascular dementia versus behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 1872-6976
Y1  - 2016///Nov-Dec
ET  - 2016/07/16
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms of subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD) are mainly associated with damage to frontal-subcortical circuits and may be similar to symptoms of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). The aim of this study was to determine whether the neuropsychiatric manifestations of the Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-negative SVaD and bvFTD groups differ. METHODS: We compared the Caregiver-Administered Neuropsychiatry Inventory (CGA-NPI) between 48 patients with PiB(-) SVaD and 31 patients with bvFTD. A stepwise logistic regression was applied to determine the best model to predict SVaD. RESULTS: The SVaD group showed a higher frequency of depression, whereas the bvFTD group had a higher frequency of elation, aberrant motor behavior and appetite/eating disorders. Regarding NPI subscores, the bvFTD group had greater severity of elation, apathy, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior and appetite/eating disorders, whereas SVaD did not have significantly higher subscores in any domains. The most predictive models that tend to find suggestions of SVaD, as opposed to bvFTD, are as follows: (1) the presence of depression and the absence of appetite/eating disorders, (2) higher NPI subscores of depression and lower NPI subscores of irritability and aberrant motor behavior. CONCLUSION: Apart from apathy, SVaD differed from bvFTD in that negative symptoms were more common in SVaD than bvFTD, whereas positive symptoms were predominant in bvFTD compared to SVaD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Apathy is a syndrome characterized by a reduction in goal-directed behavior. Neurodegenerative diseases frequently exhibit apathy. However, we lack an objective measure of apathy. The Philadelphia Apathy Computerized Task (PACT) measures impairments in goal-directed behavior that contribute to apathy, including initiation, planning, and motivation. We sought to examine these mechanisms in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. METHOD: PD patients and healthy controls with a caregiver were recruited for the study. Participants were administered the PACT, a novel computerized assessment of goal-directed behavior based on reaction times, and the Starkstein Apathy Scale (AS). Care partners completed the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Baseline demographic characteristics of PD and control participants were compared using t tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Linear regressions were used to compare PD patients to controls on each of the three PACT subtasks (initiation, planning, and motivation) while controlling for motor slowing. We then compared performance on each PACT subtask between PD subjects defined as apathetic using the NPI and Starkstein Apathy Scale and controls. RESULTS: We included 30 PD and 15 control participants in the analysis. When controlling for motor slowing, both all PD and PD apathetic subjects were significantly slower than controls on the planning task and on the initiation task. There were no significant differences between PD patients and controls on the motivation tasks. CONCLUSIONS: PD patients showed specific initiation and planning deficits compared to control participants. After using traditional scales to define apathy, PD apathetic patients still exhibited impaired initiation and planning behaviors. These results suggest that the PACT measures aspects of impaired goal-directed behavior that may contribute to apathy in PD.

AB  - The Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) has outstanding analytical potential for research on immigrants' mental health and quality of life. This article examines the quality of sampling, the composition and percentage of respondents in the SOEP sample with an immigrant background, and the indicators available in the SOEP on topics of mental health and quality of life. The concluding overview of the existing literature on these topics and of the SOEP's new refugee sub-sample underscores that the SOEP's potential for addressing these questions is far from exhausted.

T1  - Anxiety in early Parkinson's disease: Validation of the Italian observer-rated version of the Parkinson Anxiety Scale (OR-PAS)
LA  - eng

Y1  - 2016/08/15
ET  - 2016/06/04
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anxiety disorders are common in Parkinson's Disease (PD) and their identification is relevant even at early stages. The Parkinson Anxiety Scale (PAS) evaluates anxiety in PD; it was used only in the original validation study in PD patients mainly at 2-3 stages of Hoehn & Yahr system (H&Y). The study aimed to investigate psychometric properties of observer-rated version of the PAS (OR-PAS), prevalence rate of anxiety and its features, compared with diagnostic criteria in early PD patients. METHODS: A sample of 101 PD patients with H&Y:1-2 underwent the OR-PAS. To assess convergent and divergent validity, PD patients underwent Beck Anxiety Inventory, and scales assessing depression, apathy, anhedonia and cognition. To diagnose anxiety disorders, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inventory was used as gold standard. A "receiver operating characteristics" curve was obtained; positive and negative predictive values were calculated for different cut-off points of the OR-PAS and its subscales. RESULTS: There was no missing data, no floor and ceiling effects; mean score was 12.2±10.1; Cronbach's alpha was 0.899. The OR-PAS showed good convergent and divergent validity. Maximum discrimination was obtained with a cut-off score of 8.5. The anxiety occurred in 59 patients (58.4%). CONCLUSION: The OR-PAS is a reliable and valid screening instrument for assessing anxiety in patients at early PD. Anxiety was found in 58.4% of PD patients, demonstrating that anxiety occurs even at early stages.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the discriminant validity of commonly used depression and anxiety screening tools in order to determine the most suitable tool for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD patients (n = 56) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). These scores were compared to confirmed clinical diagnoses of depression and anxiety using the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview. HADS depression subscale (HADS-D) sensitivity/specificity was 78/81%; BDI-II 89/77%; HADS anxiety subscale (HADS-A) 71/81%; and BAI 89/62%. HADS-D sensitivity/specificity was improved (100/83%) with the removal of Q4 'I feel as if I am slowed down' and adjusted cut-off (≥5). Removal of BDI-II Q21 'Loss of interest in sex' with adjusted cut-off ≥12 resulted in similar improvement (100/79%). No problematic items were identified for HADS-A or BAI. Previously reported low sensitivity/specificity of the HADS for COPD patients was not replicated. Furthermore, simple modifications of the HADS-D markedly improved sensitivity/specificity for depression.BDI-II, HADS-A and BAI produced acceptable sensitivity/specificity unmodified. Pending further research for COPD patients we recommend continued use of the HADS-A with standard cut-off (≥8) and removal of Q4 of the HADS-D with lower cut-off ≥5.

T1  - Developing the Person-Environment Apathy Rating for persons with dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 1364-6915
Y1  - 2016/08/
ET  - 2015/05/18
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop the Person-Environment Apathy Rating (PEAR) scale that measures environmental stimulation and apathy in persons with dementia and to evaluate its psychometrics. METHOD: The PEAR scale consists of the PEAR-Environment subscale and PEAR-Apathy subscales. The items were developed via literature review, field testing, expert review, and pilot testing. The construct validity and reliability were examined through video observation. The parent study enrolled 185 institutionalized residents with dementia. For this study, 96 videos were selected from 24 participants. The PEAR-Environment subscale was validated using the Ambiance Scale and the Crowding Index. The PEAR-Apathy subscale was validated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)-Apathy, Passivity in Dementia Scale (PDS), and NPI-Depression. RESULTS: The PEAR-Environment subscale and PEAR-Apathy subscales each consists of six items rated on a 1-4 scale. For validity, the Crowding Index slightly, yet significantly, correlated with the PEAR-Environment subscale total score and three of the individual scores. Ambiance Scale scores, both engaging and soothing, did not correlate with the PEAR-Environment subscale. The PEAR-Apathy highly correlated with the PDS and NPI-Apathy and moderately correlated with the NPI-Depression, suggesting good convergent validity and moderate discriminant validity. For reliability, both environment and apathy subscales demonstrated excellent internal consistency. Although facial expression and eye contact showed moderate inter-rater reliability, all other items showed good to excellent inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. CONCLUSION: This study has successfully developed the PEAR scale and established its psychometrics based on the compatible scales available. The PEAR scale is the first scale that concurrently assesses apathy and environmental stimulation, and is recommended for use in persons with dementia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to validate and provide a German version of the Scale for Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders in Parkinson's disease (SEND-PD) of Martínez-Martín et al. (2012). METHOD: The German version of the SEND-PD was evaluated in a sample consisting of 96 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) (mean age: 65.3 years ± 9.6, 29 female). This scale includes 12 items, representing the domains psychotic symptoms, mood/apathy and impulse control disorders. Reliability and validity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The examined patients presented a few neuropsychiatric symptoms. Explorative factor analyses identified the proposed three dimensions solution. The items of the mood/apathy domain were homogenous and selective, and the domain showed acceptable internal consistency. For the other two domains, the values were only partially acceptable. Convergent, discriminate and construct validity were shown. CONCLUSION: The German version of the SEND-PD is sufficiently reliable and valid to be adopted in German speaking countries. However, since patients showed only a few symptoms in the dimensions of psychotic symptoms and impulse control disorders, these two domains can be evaluated only to a limited extent.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to perform psychometric testing and estimate minimal important change (MIC) of two new patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments - Sexual Arousal, Interest and Drive Scale (SAID) and Hypogonadism Energy Diary (HED). METHODS: New PRO instruments were administered immediately after screening (Time 1, test-retest subset only) and immediately prior to both randomisation (Time 2) and end-point (Time 3) to men participating in a randomised clinical trial comparing the effect of testosterone solution 2% (TS) and placebo on serum total testosterone. Psychometric analyses included reliability, validity and responsiveness. Total scores for both PRO instruments were transformed to a 0-100 scale. RESULTS: Study participants (n = 694) were 80% age ≤ 65 years, 79% White, with mean baseline testosterone = 202 ng/dl. Clinicians identified 86% subjects as having low sex drive, 86% with low energy and 76% with both symptoms. Reliability analyses for SAID and HED yielded reliability coefficients > 0.70. SAID scores discriminated between men having low sex drive (n = 553) and those who did not (n = 80) (34.5 vs. 42.8, p < 0.001). HED scores discriminated between men having low energy (n = 541) and those who did not (n = 64) (48.9 vs. 60.2, p < 0.001). In the men randomised to TS (vs. placebo), SAID and HED detected effect sizes of 0.61 (vs. 0.39) and 0.68 (vs. 0.48), respectively. MIC estimates for SAID and HED were approximately 10 and 8, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided evidence of the reliability, validity and responsiveness of SAID and HED as measures of sex drive and energy, respectively, making them potentially useful for evaluation of hypogonadal treatment.

ET  - 2015/09/21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Apathy is one of the most common and disabling syndromes of dementia and presents at all stages of the disease. Comprehensive and structured methods to assess apathy in dementia are still needed. Lille's Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) has shown good psychometric properties for apathy evaluation in Parkinson disease but has not been validated in dementia. The aim of this study was to validate the LARS in a cohort of patients with very mild to moderate dementia. METHODS: 101 patients with cognitive impairment (Clinical Dementia Rating ≤ 2) and 50 healthy subjects were recruited. Patient diagnoses included 43 individuals with Alzheimer disease, 41 frontotemporal dementia, and 17 primary progressive aphasia. In addition to LARS, the following assessments were administered: Clinical Dementia Rating, Interview for Deterioration in Daily Living Activities in Dementia, Functional Activities Questionnaire, Frontal Behavioral Inventory, Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS: Internal consistency for LARS (Cronbach's alpha) was 0.940. Test-retest intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.940 and inter-rater ICC was 0.987. The correlation among LARS and NPI apathy scores (concurrent validity) was 0.834. Receiver operating characteristic analysis estimated an area under the curve of 0.987. The optimal cutoff point was -10. Although total LARS score was influenced by the presence of depression, this disorder was independent with respect to apathy. CONCLUSION: LARS is reliable and valid for detecting and quantifying apathy in patients with dementia, even in very early stages of the disease.

AB  - AIM: The effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are making a major impact on the socioeconomic status of older adults in society. The recognition of early symptoms and clinical presentation are crucial issues to foster early diagnosis and treatment in order to have better therapeutic outcomes. METHODS: We recruited clinically diagnosed AD patients at the very mild stage in the Clinical Dementia Rating scale 0.5 and mild stage Clinical Dementia Rating scale 1.0 in Taiwan and Japan. Psychometrics including the Ascertain Dementia 8 (AD8) questionnaire were administered to collect and compare the differences of the clinical presentation of the participants from the two countries. RESULTS: A total of 1189 participants, 641 from Taiwan and 548 from Japan, were recruited in the present study. In the very mild dementia group with Clinical Dementia Rating scale 0.5, apart from AD8-2: reduced interest in hobbies/activities (P = 0.056) and AD8-4: trouble learning how to use a tool, appliance or gadget (P = 0.224), other AD8 subitems were significantly different between the two countries. Japanese participants had a higher reported frequency of AD8-5: forgetting the correct month or year (82.7%) than that (57.9%) in Taiwanese (P < 0.001). Taiwanese participants had a higher reported frequency in AD8-1: problems with judgment (20.3%), AD8-3: repeats questions, stories or statements (67.5%), AD8-6: difficulty handling complicated financial affairs (32.5%); AD8-7: difficulty remembering appointments (53.8%); and AD8-8: consistent problems with thinking and/or memory (89.3%) than those in Japanese participants. CONCLUSION: Early symptoms of AD in both countries are different. The frequently reported early symptoms are important for primary physicians and the general population so that they can recognize the disease in the early stage so as to have a better therapeutic outcome. Such efforts would increase the awareness of dementia in the general population. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 797-803.

T1  - Multidimensional apathy in ALS: validation of the Dimensional Apathy Scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 1468-330X
Y1  - 2016/06/
ET  - 2015/07/22
AB  - AIM: Apathy is a prominent symptom of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but measurement is confounded by physical disability. Furthermore, it has been traditionally measured as a unidimensional symptom despite research demonstrating a multifaceted construct. The new Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) has been specifically designed for patients with motor disability to measure 3 neurologically based subtypes of apathy: Executive, Emotional and Initiation. We aimed to explore this behavioural symptom by examining the substructure of apathy in ALS and to determine the reliability and validity of the DAS in patients and their carers. METHOD: Patients and carers were recruited through the national Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Register and were asked to complete the DAS, the standardised Apathy Evaluation Scale, and the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form. 83 patients with ALS, 75 carers and 83 sex-matched, age-matched and education-matched controls participated. RESULTS: When compared with healthy controls, patients showed a significant increase in apathy on the Initiation subscale, and were significantly less apathetic on the Emotional subscale. Scores on the DAS patient and carer versions did not significantly differ. Internal consistency reliability, convergent and discriminant validity were found to be good for the DAS subscales. There was no association between the DAS and functional disability using the ALS Functional Rating Scale. CONCLUSIONS: Apathy in ALS is characterised by a specific profile of increased initiation apathy and reduced emotional apathy. The DAS is a reliable and valid measure for the assessment of multidimensional apathy in ALS.

T1  - Base Rates of Depressive Symptoms in Patients with Coronary Heart Disease: An Individual Symptom Analysis
LA  - eng
SN  - 1932-6203
Y1  - 2016/05/26
AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depression is common in coronary heart disease (CHD) but challenging to diagnose. Instead of focusing on the overall diagnosis of depression, base rates of depressive symptoms could facilitate screening and management of psychopathology in CHD. The present study investigates the frequency of individual depressive symptoms in CHD and their impact on cardiac and subjective health. METHODS: In total, 1337 in- and outpatients with CHD were screened for depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at three different cardiac treatment sites. Tables stratified by age and gender were designed to illustrate base rates of depressive symptoms. Multiple regression analyses adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical data were conducted to test associations between individual depressive symptoms and quality of life as well impairment caused angina pectoris and dyspnea. RESULTS: During the last 14 days, more than half of patients reported a loss of energy (74.9%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 70.6-79.2), sleeping problems (69.4%, 95% CI: 64.9-74.0), loss of interest (55.7%, 95% CI: 50.8-60.7). In contrast, psychomotor change (25.6%, 95%CI: 21.3-30.0), feelings of failure (21.9%, 95%CI: 17.7-26.0), suicidal ideations (14.1%, 95%CI: 10.7-17.6) were less frequently reported. Depending on the outcome, only particular depressive symptoms were highly associated with low quality of life and impairment caused by angina pectoris and dyspnea. Loss of energy was the only depressive symptom that reliably predicted all three outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms in CHD are frequent but vary widely in terms of frequency. Findings underline the differential effects of individual depressive symptoms on cardiac health. Presented base rates of depressive symptoms offer clinicians a new way to judge the severity of individual depressive symptoms and to communicate individual PHQ-9 profiles with patients with respect to gender, age, cardiac symptoms and quality of life.

T1  - Know thyself: Exploring interoceptive sensitivity in Parkinson's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1878-5883
Y1  - 2016/05/15
ET  - 2016/03/12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is defined by its motor symptoms, it is now well recognised that cognitive, affective and emotion domains are also impaired. The pathophysiology of these disabling non-motor symptoms (NMS) remains unclear; recently the involvement of limbic areas, including the insula, in the neurodegenerative process has been suggested to have a key role. These areas, and the insula in particular, are also been suggested as key regions for interoception; interoceptive sensitivity (IS) is a measure of the accuracy of perception of sensations from inside the body related to the function of internal organs. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate IS in PD patients by means of a well-established task: the heartbeat perception task. Moreover, we evaluated possible correlations between IS and psychological, affective and disease-related characteristics as well as fatigue perception in PD patients. METHODS: Twenty PD patients and 20 healthy subjects (HS) were included and underwent the heartbeat perception task. An extensive evaluation of motor, non-motor, affective and emotion domains was carried out. RESULTS: PD patients showed lower IS than HS (0.58±0.2 vs 0.72±0.1; p=0.04). PD reported higher scores in scales assessing depression (Hamilton depression scale: 8.7±5.8 vs 6.2±7.5; p=0.04); anhedonia (Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale: 26.8±9.7 vs 15.4±2.9; p=<0.001) and apathy (Apathy Evaluation Scale: 35.8±8.6 vs 27.8±6.8; p=0.008). No significant correlations were detected between IS and motor, non-motor, affective and emotion symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: PD patients have reduced interoceptive sensitivity. Future studies are encouraged to evaluate the importance of interoception in understanding the pathophysiology of affective/emotional symptoms in PD.

T1  - The SPADE Symptom Cluster in Primary Care Patients With Chronic Pain
LA  - eng
SN  - 1536-5409
SN  - 0749-8047
Y1  - 2016/05/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sleep disturbance, pain, anxiety, depression, and low energy/fatigue, the SPADE pentad, are the most prevalent and co-occurring symptoms in the general population and clinical practice. Co-occurrence of SPADE symptoms may produce additive impairment and negatively affect treatment response, potentially undermining patients' health and functioning. The purpose of this paper is to determine: (1) prevalence and comorbidity (ie, clustering) of SPADE symptoms; (2) internal reliability and construct validity of a composite SPADE symptom score derived from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures; and (3) whether improvement in somatic symptom burden represented by a composite score predicted subsequent measures of functional status at 3 and 12 months follow-up. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from the Stepped Care to Optimize Pain care Effectiveness study, a randomized trial of a collaborative care intervention for Veterans with chronic pain. RESULTS: Most patients had multiple SPADE symptoms; only 9.6% of patients were monosymptomatic. The composite PROMIS symptom score had good internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha=0.86) and construct validity and strongly correlated with multiple measures of functional status; improvement in the composite score significantly correlated with higher scores for 5 of 6 functional status outcomes. The standardized error of measurement (SEM) for the composite T-score was 2.84, suggesting a 3-point difference in an individual's composite score may be clinically meaningful. DISCUSSION: Brief PROMIS measures may be useful in evaluating SPADE symptoms and overall symptom burden. Because symptom burden may predict functional status outcomes, better identification and management of comorbid symptoms may be warranted.

T1  - Excessive daytime sleepiness is related to subjective memory impairment in late life: a cross-sectional community-based study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1479-8301
Y1  - 2016/05/
ET  - 2015/07/16
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether daytime sleepiness is related to subjective memory impairment among community-dwelling elderly people, after adjustment for psychosocial variables. METHODS: Questionnaires were mailed to all 5199 elderly residents living in one area of Tokyo. The questionnaires collected information about sociodemographic variables, subjective memory impairment, and excessive daytime sleepiness, which was measured by the Japanese version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Information was also collected on sleep hygiene, health-related variables, and psychosocial variables, including perceived social support, social withdrawal, and work status. RESULTS: Of the 4783 questionnaires that were returned (92.0%), 4185 participants were included in the analysis (valid response rate: 80.5%), after the exclusion of questionnaires with missing data. The average score on the Japanese version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was 5.0 ± 3.9 for men and 4.5 ± 3.7 for women. The frequency of excessive daytime sleepiness was 8.3% for men, 5.8% for women, and 7.0% in total. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression revealed the odds ratio of excessive daytime sleepiness as a predictor of subjective memory impairment was 6.06 (95% confidence interval; 3.06-12.03). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly people who complain of daytime sleepiness are potential candidates for interventions related to dementia care after careful consideration of other possible causes of sleepiness.

T1  - Development of two measures of client engagement for use in home aged care
LA  - eng
SN  - 1365-2524
Y1  - 2016/05/
ET  - 2015/02/26
AB  - The aim of the study was to develop and validate measures of client engagement in aged homecare. The Homecare Measure of Engagement-Staff questionnaire (HoME-S) is a self-complete measure of six dimensions of client engagement: client acceptance, attention, attitude, appropriateness, engagement duration and passivity. The Homecare Measure of Engagement-Client/Family report (HoME-CF) is a researcher-rated interview which obtains client and/or family perspectives regarding frequency and valence of conversational and recreational engagement during care worker visits. Care workers (n = 84) completed the HoME-S and a measure of relationship bond with client. Researchers interviewed clients (n = 164) and/or their family (n = 117) and completed the HoME-CF, and measures of agitation, dysphoria, apathy and cognitive functioning. The HoME-S and HoME-CF demonstrated good test-retest and inter-rater reliability, and showed significant negative correlations with apathy, agitation and non-English-speaking background. Controlling for client and care service characteristics, a stronger care worker-client relationship bond and English-speaking background were independently associated with higher HoME-S scores, and apathy was independently associated with higher HoME-CF scores. In conclusion, the HoME-S and HoME-CF are psychometrically sound engagement measures for use in homecare. Clients who are apathetic or from non-English-speaking backgrounds may be less responsive to traditional care worker engagement strategies. Engagement may be augmented in clients who have stronger relationships with their care workers.

T1  - Validation of the Italian version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-I) in institutionalized geriatric patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 2384-8553
Y1  - 2016///Apr-Jun
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Apathy is a very common symptom in the institutionalized elderly and represents a condition of both clinical and public health importance. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) has been shown to be a valid and reliable tool for characterizing, quantifying and differentiating apathy in various health conditions. The aims of this study were to establish the validity and reliability of the Italian version of the AES, and to assess the severity of apathy in a sample of Italian institutionalized geriatric patients. METHOD: Data were collected from clinical interviews using the AES informant version (AES-I). Associations between measures of apathy and depression, cognitive functioning and perceived quality of life were evaluated, as well as the effects of the living environment on apathetic symptoms. RESULTS: Multiple forms of reliability and validity (i.e. test-retest, internal consistency, discriminability of apathy rating from a standard measure of depression) were satisfied. Our results also show that the characteristics of the care setting may affect the severity of apathetic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The AES-I Italian version is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring apathy in Italian patients, also allowing a direct comparison with data gathered in other countries.

T1  - Serum uric acid is associated with apathy in early, drug-naïve Parkinson's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1435-1463
Y1  - 2016/04/
ET  - 2016/01/06
AB  - Both low serum uric acid (UA) levels and apathy are considered biomarkers of cognitive decline and dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD). There is an urgent need to combine different biomarkers to predict disease course in PD. Data on the relationship between serum UA levels and apathy in PD are lacking. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between serum UA levels and pure apathy in early, drug-naïve PD patients. Forty-nine early, drug-naïve PD patients were enrolled and stratified into two groups using the median serum UA levels at diagnosis (Group 1 serum UA ≤ 4.8 mg/dl; Group 2 serum UA > 4.8 mg/dl). The cohort was followed for the first 2 years of disease. Apathy was evaluated with the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). Patients with lower serum UA levels presented significant higher AES score compared to patients with higher serum UA levels. Regression analysis showed that baseline serum UA levels were significant determinants of AES scores at both baseline and 2-year follow up, irrespective of gender, age, attention/executive functions and dopamine replacement therapy when applicable. This is the first study showing a link between serum UA levels and apathy in non-demented, non-depressed, early, drug-naïve PD, being lower serum UA levels associated with greater apathy. Further follow up of our patients and replication of this observation in independent cohorts are needed to establish if this combination of biomarkers may help in characterizing a subgroup of PD patients at diagnosis.

T1  - Depressive symptoms predict non-completion of a structured exercise intervention for people with Type 2 diabetes
LA  - eng
SN  - 1464-5491
Y1  - 2016/04/
ET  - 2015/08/25
AB  - AIM: To quantify the impact of depressive symptoms on completion of exercise-based rehabilitation for Type 2 diabetes management. METHODS: Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale in a prospective cohort of consecutive patients with Type 2 diabetes entering a 6-month hybrid (home- and clinic-based) exercise rehabilitation programme. Attendance at exercise sessions was monitored and programme completion/non-completion was ascertained. RESULTS: Of the programme participants (n=624, mean age 55.6±10.5 years, 47% male), 26.8% endorsed significant depressive symptoms (depression score ≥16) and 68.1% completed the intervention, attending 54.6±30.0% of supervised exercise sessions. Baseline depressive symptoms (depression scale score ≥16) increased the risk of non-completion [hazard ratio 1.49 (95% CI 1.10-2.03); P = 0.010], and predicted fewer sessions attended (β=-2.1, P= 0.002) in adjusted models. A depression score threshold of ≥10 (48.4% of participants) predicted non-completion [hazard ratio 1.60 (95% CI 1.19-2.17); P= 0.002) with optimum accuracy. Non-completions resulting from lack of interest (18.9 vs. 11.0%; P= 0.026) and medical complications (14.6 vs. 6.6%; P= 0.006) were more common among participants with depression scores ≥10. Greater hazard ratios for depression scores ≥10 were observed in subgroups not currently using insulin [hazard ratio 1.70 (95% CI 1.24-2.33); P= 0.001), or an antidepressant [hazard ratio 1.83 (95% CI 1.32-2.54); P<0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms were highly prevalent among participants with Type 2 diabetes entering exercise-based rehabilitation, and even mild depressive symptoms posed a significant barrier to completion. Depression screening may help target additional supports to facilitate completion of exercise interventions for people with Type 2 diabetes.

T1  - Accuracy of screening instruments for detection of neuropsychiatric syndromes in Parkinson's disease
LA  - eng

ET  - 2015/12/22
AB  - Parkinson's disease includes neuropsychiatric manifestations, such as depression, anxiety, apathy, psychosis, and impulse control disorders, which often are unreported by patients and caregivers or undetected by doctors. Given their substantial impact on patients and caregivers as well as the existence of effective therapies for some of these disorders, screening for neuropsychiatric symptoms is important. Instruments for screening have a particular methodology for validation, and their performance is expressed in terms of accuracy compared with formal diagnostic criteria. The present study reviews the attributes of the screening instruments applied for detection of the aforementioned major neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease. A quasi-systematic review (including predefined selection criteria, but not evaluating the quality of the reviewed studies) was carried out on the basis of previous systematic reviews (commissioned by the American Academy of Neurology and the Movement Disorder Society) and made current by conducting a literature search (2005-2014). For depression, 11 scales and questionnaires were shown to be valid for Parkinson's disease screening. The recently developed Parkinson Anxiety Scale and the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory demonstrate satisfactory properties as screening instruments for anxiety, and the Lille Apathy Rating Scale for detection of apathy. No scale adequately screens for psychosis, so a specific psychosis instrument should be developed. The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease (Questionnaire and Rating Scale) are valid for comprehensive screening of impulse control disorders, and the Parkinson's Disease-Sexual Addiction Screening Test for hypersexuality specifically.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is disabling in Parkinson disease. It is often associated with other non-motor symptoms, but little is known about its underlying pathophysiology. OBJECTIVE: To investigate neuroimaging (using dopaminergic and cholinergic PET) and clinical factors associated with fatigue severity in PD. METHODS: 133 PD subjects (96M/37F) completed the Fatigue Severity Scale, Movement Disorders Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), Hoehn-Yahr staging, validated scales for depression, anxiety, apathy, sleep, and cognition, and underwent [(11)C]methyl-4-piperidinyl propionate (PMP) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and [(11)C]dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ) monoaminergic PET imaging. We explored contributions to PD fatigue using separate regression models based either on neuroimaging parameters or clinicometric scales. RESULTS: In a neuroimaging regression model, neither striatal DTBZ uptake nor AChE PMP uptake were predictors of fatigue in PD. In a post-hoc neuroimaging regression model, stratifying the total cohort into mild vs. moderate-to-severe PD, striatal DTBZ uptake was a significant predictor of fatigue in mild but not moderate-to-severe PD. In a clinicometric regression model, higher Beck Depression Inventory-somatic subscore, higher levodopa dose equivalents and younger age were all significant predictors of fatigue in PD, but the MDS-UPDRS non-motor experiences of daily living score was the best predictor overall. CONCLUSIONS: Cholinergic uptake was not a predictor of fatigue in PD, but nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation predicted fatigue in mild disease. Total non-motor symptom burden, somatic affective symptoms, levodopa dose equivalents, and younger age were independent clinical predictors of fatigue.

LA  - eng
SN  - 1932-6203
Y1  - 2016/01/29
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many studies have highlighted the high prevalence of executive disorders in stroke. However, major uncertainties remain due to use of variable and non-validated methods. The objectives of this study were: 1) to characterize the executive disorder profile in stroke using a standardized battery, validated diagnosis criteria of executive disorders and validated framework for the interpretation of neuropsychological data and 2) examine the sensitivity of the harmonization standards protocol proposed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Canadian Stroke Network (NINDS-CSN) for the diagnosis of Vascular Cognitive Impairment. METHODS: 237 patients (infarct: 57; cerebral hemorrhage: 54; ruptured aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery (ACoA): 80; cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT): 46) were examined by using the GREFEX battery. The patients' test results were interpreted with a validated framework derived from normative data from 780 controls. RESULTS: Dysexecutive syndrome was observed in 88 (55.7%; 95%CI: 48-63.4) out of the 156 patients with full cognitive and behavioral data: 40 (45.5%) had combined behavioral and cognitive syndromes, 29 (33%) had a behavioral disorder alone and 19 (21.6%) had a cognitive syndrome alone. The dysexecutive profile was characterized by prominent impairments of initiation and generation in the cognitive domain and by hypoactivity with disinterest and anticipation loss in the behavioral domain. Cognitive impairment was more frequent (p = 0.014) in hemorrhage and behavioral disorders were more frequent (p = 0.004) in infarct and hemorrhage. The harmonization standards protocol underestimated (p = 0.007) executive disorders in CVT or ACoA. CONCLUSIONS: This profile of executive disorders implies that the assessment should include both cognitive tests and a validated inventory for behavioral dysexecutive syndrome. Initial assessment may be performed with a short cognitive battery, such as the harmonization standards protocol. However, administration of a full cognitive battery is required in selected patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to test the psychometric properties of the Polish version of the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) - its factor structure, reliability, validity and standard norms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 3 independent samples of 1804, 366 and 48 workers employed in social service and general service professions. To test the OLBI structure the exploratory factor analysis was conducted. The reliability was assessed by means of Cronbach's α coefficient (the internal consistent) and test-retest (the stability over time) method, with a 6-week follow-up. The construct validity of the OLBI was tested by means of correlation analysis, using perceived stress and work engagement as the criterion variables. RESULTS: The result of the factor analysis confirmed a 2-factor structure of the Inventory but the construction of each factor differed from that in the OLBI original version. Therefore, 2 separate factor analyses - each for the single component of job burnout (exhaustion and disengagement from work) - were conducted. The analyses revealed that each of the components consisted of 2 subscales. The reliability of the OLBI was supported by 2 methods. It was also proved that job burnout and its 2 components, exhaustion and disengagement from work, were positively correlated with perceived stress and negatively correlated with work engagement and its 3 components - vigor, absorption and dedication. CONCLUSIONS: Despite certain limitations the Polish version of the OLBI shows satisfactory psychometric properties and it can be used to measure job burnout in Polish conditions.

T1  - Apathy and Attentional Biases in Alzheimer's Disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-8908
Y1  - 2016
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy, one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD), can be difficult to assess as cognition deteriorates. There is a need for more objective assessments that do not rely on patient insight, communicative capacities, or caregiver observation. OBJECTIVE: We measured visual scanning behavior, using an eye-tracker, to explore attentional bias in the presence of competing stimuli to assess apathy in AD patients. METHODS: Mild-to-moderate AD patients (Standardized Mini-Mental Status Examination, sMMSE >10) were assessed for apathy (Neuropsychiatric Inventory [NPI] apathy, Apathy Evaluation Scale [AES]). Participants were presented with 16 slides, each containing 4 images of different emotional themes (2 neutral, 1 social, 1 dysphoric). The duration of time spent, and fixation frequency on images were measured. RESULTS: Of the 36 AD patients (14 females, age = 78.2±7.8, sMMSE = 22.4±3.5) included, 17 had significant apathy (based on NPI apathy ≥4) and 19 did not. These groups had comparable age and sMMSE. Repeated-measures analysis of covariance models, controlling for total NPI, showed group (apathetic versus non-apathetic) by image (social versus dysphoric) interactions for duration (F(1,32) = 4.31, p = 0.046) and fixation frequency (F(1,32) = 11.34, p = 0.002). Apathetic patients demonstrated reduced duration and fixation frequency on social images compared with non-apathetic patients. Additionally, linear regression models suggest that more severe apathy predicted decreasing fixation frequency on social images (R2 = 0.26, Adjusted R2 = 0.19, F(3,32) = 3.65, p = 0.023). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that diminished attentional bias toward social-themed stimuli is a marker of apathy in AD. Measurements of visual scanning behavior may have the potential to predict and monitor treatment response in apathy.

T1  - Lille Apathy Rating Scale and MDS-UPDRS for Screening Apathy in Parkinson's Disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1877-718X
Y1  - 2016
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a syndrome characterized primarily by lack of motivation which may be associated with cognitive, affective and behavioral changes. Although the Lille Apathy Scale (LARS) has been extensively utilized in PD for detecting apathy and testing the effectiveness of specific therapeutic interventions, the highly variable cut-off values (between -11 and -22 points) ensures the applicability of the LARS degree of difficulty as a superb screening tool. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine more reliable threshold values based on the neuropsychiatric status of patients. METHODS: Depression was assessed utilizing the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and neurocognitive status by Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination. The presence of apathy was assessed by the proposed diagnostic criteria of Drijgers et al, and graded by both LARS and the 'Apathy' item of MDS-UPDRS. RESULTS: Based on multivariate regression analysis, we revealed the neurocognitive status, severity of depression, and also gender while applying dosage of dopamine agonists to determine the degree of patient apathy. Based on whether or not depression and neurocognitive disorders were indeed present, we established four different threshold values for the LARS: patients with normal cognition and without depression: -22.5; patients with normal cognition and with depression: -18.5; patients with NCD and without depression: -19.5; patients with NCD and with depression: -14.5. CONCLUSIONS: The LARS and the 'Apathy' item of MDS-UPDRS were confirmed to be potentially operational, beneficial and easy-to-assess instruments for detecting apathy syndrome in PD. However, there is no universal threshold value for the LARS suitable in all types of Parkinson's patients.

T1  - When a Little Knowledge Can Be Dangerous: False-Positive Diagnosis of Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia among Community Clinicians
LA  - eng
SN  - 1421-9824
SN  - 1420-8008
Y1  - 2016
ET  - 2016/01/08
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is important as patients' behavioral symptoms have profound implications for their families and communities. Since the diagnosis of bvFTD derives from behavioral features, accurate identification of patients can be difficult for non-specialists. Concrete rates of diagnostic accuracy among non-specialists are unavailable. METHODS: To examine the accuracy of community clinicians' diagnoses of bvFTD and to identify patient characteristics leading to misdiagnosis, we reviewed the charts and referral letters of 3,578 patients who were seen at our specialized center. Referral diagnosis and reasons, manifesting symptoms, demographic data, Mini-Mental State Examination score, Clinical Dementia Rating score and Neuropsychiatric Inventory score were extracted. RESULTS: 60% of patients assigned a single diagnosis of bvFTD by community clinicians did not have bvFTD according to specialists. Compared to specialist-confirmed bvFTD patients, false bvFTD patients were more likely to be depressed and to be non-Caucasian, showed less euphoria, apathy, disinhibition and abnormal eating behaviors, had milder disease severity and better overall cognition. bvFTD was mentioned by referring clinicians in 86% of specialist-confirmed bvFTD cases, but missed cases were called Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or Huntington's disease, or progressive aphasia. CONCLUSION: These results revealed a widespread lack of familiarity with core diagnostic symptoms among non-specialists and suggest that community clinicians require specialized diagnostic support before providing a definitive diagnosis of bvFTD.

T1  - Associations Between Original and a Reduced Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe), Cognition, and Activities of Daily Living in a Large Neurologic Sample
LA  - eng
SN  - 2327-9109
Y1  - 2016
ET  - 2015/10/27
AB  - A recent confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) indicated that the basic structure of the FrSBe subscales held after removal of 8 weak items. In a replication of previous studies using the original FrSBe, the present study explored associations between a reduced version of the FrSBe, cognition, and activities of daily living (ADLs) in a large mixed outpatient neurologic sample. Consistent with previous findings with the original FrSBe, significant associations existed between reduced FrSBe scores and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-Second Edition. Additionally, after controlling for age, gender, and education, reduced FrSBe Apathy was associated with basic ADLs, and reduced FrSBe Disinhibition was associated with instrumental ADLs. These results offer replication in a larger sample of previous findings and statistical support for a reduced FrSBe beyond CFA results alone.

Y1  - 2016/01/
ET  - 2015/08/06
AB  - Brief screening tools that detect and differentiate patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALSFTD) from those more subtle cognitive or behavioral symptoms (ALS plus) and motor symptoms only (ALS pure) is pertinent in a clinical setting. The utility of 2 validated and data-driven tests (Mini-Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination [M-ACE] and Motor Neuron Disease Behavioral Scale [MiND-B]) was investigated in 70 ALS patients (24 ALSFTD, 19 ALS plus, and 27 ALS pure). More than 90% of patients with ALSFTD scored at or below the cutoff on the M-ACE, whereas this was seen in only about 20% of ALS patients without dementia. The MiND-B differentiated between ALS pure and ALS plus diagnostic categories. Rasch modeling of M-ACE and MiND-B items revealed early cognitive (fluency, memory recall) and behavioral (apathy) symptoms in ALSFTD. The combined use of the M-ACE and MiND-B detects patients with ALSFTD, differentiates along the ALS continuum, and offers insight into the progression of nonmotor symptomatology in ALSFTD.

AB  - This study aimed to examine how stigma impacts on symptomatic and subjective recovery from psychosis, both concurrently and longitudinally. We also aimed to investigate whether self-esteem and hopelessness mediated the observed associations between stigma and outcomes. 80 service-users with psychosis completed symptom (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) and subjective recovery measures (Process of Recovery Questionnaire) at baseline and 6-months later, and also completed the King Stigma Scale, the Self-Esteem Rating Scale and the Beck Hopelessness Scale at baseline. In cross sectional regression and multiple mediation analyses of the baseline data, we found that stigma predicted both symptomatic and subjective recovery, and the effects of stigma on these outcomes were mediated by hopelessness and self-esteem. When the follow-up data were examined, stigma at baseline continued to predict recovery judgements and symptoms. However, self-esteem only mediated the effect of stigma on PANSS passive social withdrawal. Self-esteem and hopelessness should be considered in interventions to reduce the effects of stigma. Interventions that address the current and long-term effects of stigma may positively affect outcome for people being treated for psychosis.

T1  - Screening Performance for Frailty Among Older Patients With Cancer: A Cross-Sectional Observational Study of Two Approaches
LA  - eng
SN  - 1540-1413
Y1  - 2015/12/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the screening performance for frailty of the Vulnerable Elders Survey-13 (VES-13) and the 2-step approach consisting of the VES-13 plus the anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure) item from Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) among older patients with newly diagnosed cancer. METHODS: This study involved 106 consecutive inpatients aged 65 years or older, newly diagnosed with malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, just before chemotherapy initiation. The participants were administered the VES-13, and also underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), including for depression and 6 other geriatric conditions, using validated measures, just before initiation of chemotherapy. We defined frailty as the presence of 2 or more geriatric conditions as determined by the CGA. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed. The 2-step screening approach was examined by post hoc analysis. RESULTS: The average age of the subjects was 74 years. Among the 106 subjects, 50% met the criteria for frailty. Using a cutoff score of 2 to 3 on the VES-13, a sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of 72% of the screening tool was obtained for the condition of frailty. When the second step of the screening, consisting of the VES-13 plus anhedonia, was applied to the VES-13-negative patients, the sensitivity and NPV improved to 90% and 88%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The 2-step approach exhibited better screening performance for frailty among patients with cancer than existing methods. Large prospective studies are required in the future to confirm this ability of the 2-step approach.

T1  - Quality of Life and Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Long-Term Treated Dermatitis Herpetiformis Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study in Finland
LA  - eng
SN  - 1179-1888
Y1  - 2015/12/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. Both conditions are treated with a restrictive life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). Treated celiac disease patients have been shown to have more severe gastrointestinal symptoms and inferior quality of life compared with healthy controls, but evidence regarding quality of life in DH is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate whether long-term GFD-treated DH patients suffer from persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and if they experience a drawdown in quality of life. METHODS: Gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life were assessed in 78 long-term GFD-treated DH patients using the validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, Psychological General Well-Being and Short Form 36 Health Survey questionnaires. The findings were compared with 110 healthy controls, population-based reference values and 371 treated celiac disease controls. RESULTS: The median age of the DH patients at the time of the study was 57 years, and 51 % were male. Significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms or quality of life were not detected when treated DH patients were compared with healthy controls, but treated DH patients had less severe gastrointestinal symptoms and increased quality of life compared with celiac disease controls. Female DH patients had more severe gastrointestinal symptoms and reduced vitality compared with male DH patients. The presence of skin symptoms and the adherence to or duration of GFD did not have any influence on gastrointestinal symptoms or quality of life. CONCLUSION: We conclude that long-term GFD-treated DH patients do not suffer from the burden of dietary treatment and have a quality of life comparable to that of controls.

T1  - Quantitative assessment of non-motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease using the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS)

AB  - Data on frequency, severity and correlations of NMS with motor complications are only available for a limited number of NMS. The NMS Scale (NMSS) is a validated tool to assess a broad range of NMS, which has not been used in NMS fluctuations. We assessed fluctuations of a broad range of non-motor symptom (NMS) for a 1-month time period in fluctuating Parkinson's disease (PD) in a multicenter cross-sectional study using the NMSS assessing NMS in motor On (NMSSOn) and Off state (NMSSOff) combined with clinical NMS and motor function scoring in 100 fluctuating PD patients. ΔNMSSOn/Off was defined as the differences of NMSS scores between On and Off. Complete NMSS datasets were available from 73 patients (53 % men; age: 68.2 ± 9.7 years) with mean total NMSS score in On state of 41.5 ± 37.6 and in Off state of 75.6 ± 42.3 (P < 0.001). Scores were higher in Off compared to On state for all domains except for domain "perceptual problems/hallucinations" (P = 0.608). Clinimetric properties of the NMSS were similar to those reported previously for NMS assessments independent of motor oscillations. NMSSOn, NMSSOff and ΔNMSSOn/Off showed weak to moderate correlations with demographics, indicators of motor symptom severity as well as with other measures of NMS, depression and quality of life. Correlations of NMSS items/domains with independent measures of related constructs were weak to moderate. In conclusion, when assessed with the NMSS, a broad range of NMS fluctuate with motor oscillations, but these fluctuations do neither correlate with motor function nor with measures of disease progression.

T1  - Radial shock wave treatment alone is less efficient than radial shock wave treatment combined with tissue-specific plantar fascia-stretching in patients with chronic plantar heel pain
LA  - eng
SN  - 1743-9159
Y1  - 2015/12/
ET  - 2015/05/01
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether shock wave therapy or shock wave therapy combined with plantar fascia-specific stretching is more efficient in treating chronic plantar heel pain remains unclear. The aim of the study was to test the null hypothesis of no difference of these two forms of management for patients who had unilateral plantar fasciopathy for a minimum duration of twelve months and which had failed at least three other forms of treatment. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-two patients with chronic plantar fasciopathy were assigned to receive repetitive low-energy radial shock-wave therapy without local anesthesia, administered weekly for three weeks (Group 1, n = 73) or to receive the identical shock wave treatment and to perform an eight-week plantar fascia-specific stretching program (Group 2, n = 79). All patients completed the nine-item pain subscale of the validated Foot Function Index and a subject-relevant outcome questionnaire. Patients were evaluated at baseline, and at two, four, and twenty-four months after baseline. The primary outcome measures were a mean change in the Foot Function Index sum score at two months after baseline, a mean change in item 2 (pain during the first steps of walking in the morning) on this Index, and satisfaction with treatment. RESULTS: No difference in mean age, sex, weight or duration of symptoms was found between the groups at baseline. At two months after baseline, the Foot Function Index sum score showed significantly greater changes for the patients managed with shock-wave therapy plus plantar fascia-specific stretching than those managed with shock-wave therapy alone (p < 0.001), as well as individually for item 2 (p < 0.001). Twenty-four patients in Group 1 (32%) versus forty-seven patients in Group 2 (59%) were satisfied with the treatment (p < 0.001). Significant differences persisted at four months, but not at twenty-four months. CONCLUSIONS: A program of manual stretching exercises specific to the plantar fascia in combination with repetitive low-energy radial shock-wave therapy is more efficient than repetitive low-energy radial shock-wave therapy alone for the treatment of chronic symptoms of proximal plantar fasciopathy.

T1  - Caregiver report versus clinician impression: disagreements in rating neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 1099-1166
Y1  - 2015/12/
ET  - 2015/03/09
AB  - BACKGROUND: The measurement of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in dementia is often based on caregiver report. Challenges associated with providing care may bias the caregiver's recognition and reporting of symptoms. Given potential problems associated with caregiver report, clinicians may improve measurement by drawing from a wider array of available data and by applying clinical judgment. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate potential disagreements between caregiver report and clinician impression when rating psychopathological manifestations from the same patient with dementia. METHODS: Three hundred twelve participants (156 patients with Alzheimer's disease [AD] and 156 caregivers) were studied using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician Rating Scale. We considered disagreement to be present when caregiver ratings were significantly higher or lower (p < 0.05) than NPS ratings by clinicians of the same patient. To evaluate whether disagreements were related to dementia severity, we repeated comparisons across levels defined by the clinical dementia rating. RESULTS: The most common disagreements involved ratings of agitation, depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, and aberrant motor behavior especially in patients with mild dementia. There were fewer discrepancies in moderate or severe dementia. The most consistent disagreements involved global ratings of depression where caregiver scores ranged from +22.5 higher to -4.5 lower than clinician rating. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers may have incomplete perception of patient NPS mainly in mild dementia. NPS ratings might be confounded by cultural beliefs, sometimes leading caregiver to interpret symptoms as part of "normal" aging.

AB  - Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) often develop extrapyramidal signs (EPS), which increase in frequency as the disease progresses. We aimed to investigate the patterns of presentation of EPS in AD and their correlation with clinical and neuropathological features. 4284 subjects diagnosed with AD from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) database with at least one abnormal Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) assessment were included. Individuals were assigned to a discovery sample and a sensitivity analysis sample (moderate and mild dementia, respectively) and a subset of subjects provided neuropathological data (n = 284). Individuals from the Washington Heights and Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) served as validation sample. Patterns of presentation of EPS were identified employing categorical principal component analysis (CATPCA). Six principal components were identified in both mild and moderate AD samples: (I) hand movements, alternating movements, finger tapping, leg agility ("limbs bradykinesia"); (II) posture, postural instability, arising from chair, gait and body bradykinesia/hypokinesia ("axial"); (III) limb rigidity ("rigidity"); (IV) postural tremor; (V) resting tremor; (VI) speech and facial expression. Similar results were obtained in the WHICAP cohort. Individuals with hallucinations, apathy, aberrant night behaviors and more severe dementia showed higher axial and limb bradykinesia scores. "Limb bradykinesia" component was associated with a neuropathological diagnosis of Lewy body disease and "axial" component with reduced AD-type pathology. Patterns of EPS in AD show distinct clinical and neuropathological correlates; they share a pattern of presentation similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease, suggesting common pathogenic mechanisms across neurodegenerative diseases.

T1  - Exploring preferences for domain-specific goal management in patients with polyarthritis: what to do when an important goal becomes threatened?

AB  - Usually priorities in goal management--intended to minimize discrepancies between a given and desired situation--are studied as person characteristics, neglecting possible domain-specific aspects. However, people may make different decisions in different situations depending on the importance of the personal issues at stake. Aim of the present study therefore was to develop arthritis-related vignettes to examine domain-specific goal management and to explore patients' preferences. Based on interviews and literature, situation-specific hypothetical stories were developed in which the main character encounters a problem with a valued goal due to arthritis. Thirty-one patients (61 % female, mean age 60 years) evaluated the face validity of the newly developed vignettes. Secondly, 262 patients (60 % female, mean age 63 years) were asked to come up with possible solutions for the problems with attaining a goal described in a subset of the vignettes. Goal management strategies within the responses and the preference for the various strategies were identified. The 11 developed vignettes in three domains were found to be face-valid. In 90 % of the responses, goal management strategies were identified (31 % goal maintenance, 29 % goal adjustment, 21 % goal disengagement, and 10 % goal re-engagement). Strategy preference was related to domains. Solutions containing goal disengagement were the least preferred. Using vignettes for measuring domain-specific goal management appears as valuable addition to the existing questionnaires. The vignettes can be used to study how patients with arthritis cope with threatened goals in specific domains from a patient's perspective. Domain-specific strategy preference emphasizes the importance of a situation-specific instrument.

T1  - Probable RBD and association with neurodegenerative disease markers: A population-based study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1531-8257
Y1  - 2015/09/
ET  - 2015/07/24
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and its association with markers of neurodegeneration in the general population are poorly defined. METHODS: We assessed the prevalence of probable RBD defined by two validated questionnaires, the RBD Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ) and the Innsbruck RBD-Inventory (RBD-I), and studied its associations with clinical and imaging markers for neurodegeneration in the Bruneck Study cohort aged 60 y or older. RESULTS: Of the 456 participants without Parkinson's disease, 4.6% (RBDSQ; 95%CI, 3.0%-7.0%) and 7.7% (RBD-I; 95%CI, 5.6%-10.5%) had probable RBD. Probable RBD diagnosed with either of the questionnaires was associated with hyposmia (trend; P < 0.1), anxiety (P < 0.05), depression (P < 0.05), antidepressant use (P < 0.05), and self-reported non-motor symptoms (P < 0.01), specifically, dribbling saliva, memory problems, apathy, concentration problems, and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may provide a basis for future studies intending to identify cohorts at risk for Lewy body diseases through screening of the general elderly population for RBD.

AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to examine the correlations between patient and caregiver characteristics with caregiver burden, anxiety and depression in Alzheimer's Disease. Secondary aim was to determine which behavioural and psychological symptoms had the greatest impact on caregiver burden, anxiety and depression in Alzheimer's Disease. BACKGROUND: Caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease experience high levels of burden, both psychologically and physically. Previous studies have examined caregiver burden, anxiety and depression separately. However, no paper has examined these three psychological conditions simultaneously. DESIGN: A cross-sectional design. METHODS: A total of 310 patients with probable Alzheimer's Disease and their primary caregivers were assessed. Cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed with the Mini Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Clock Drawing Test and Neuropsychiatric Inventory, respectively. Caregiver burden, anxiety and depression were assessed with the ZBI, Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. RESULTS: All 12 neuropsychiatric symptoms in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory were significantly correlated with caregiver burden, anxiety and depression, with the top three neuropsychiatric predictors being depression, apathy and anxiety. Furthermore, higher levels of caregiver anxiety were associated with a longer duration of being a caregiver. Within caregivers, higher levels of depression were independently associated with higher numbers of additional caregivers, lower educational background and being the spouse of the patient. Higher levels of burden were associated with a longer duration of being a caregiver and being the spouse of the patient. Caregiver burden, anxiety or depression were not significantly correlated with hours/day of caring for the patient. CONCLUSIONS: Caregiver burden, anxiety and depression were significantly correlated with different neuropsychiatric symptoms in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Practitioners are able to identify caregivers at risk for burden, anxiety and depression. Understanding which Neuropsychiatric Inventory symptom is more closely associated with distress in caregivers will help practitioners to be more specific and effective in detecting caregiver distress.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous validation studies of the Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS) suffer methodological shortcomings. The present study aimed to re-evaluate its psychometric properties using exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM). METHODS: A Chinese sample of 1259 community-dwelling residents completed the 11-item Chinese CFS and a variety of health measures (anxiety, depression, exhaustion, sleep disturbance, and quality of life). In addition to traditional confirmatory factor analysis, ESEM was performed to assess the fit of two- and three-factor models using robust maximum likelihood estimation and oblique geomin rotation. Convergent validity of the CFS was examined via associations with five covariates (gender, age, exercise, perceived health, and life event) and the health measures in the ESEM model. RESULTS: The ESEM models displayed a superior fit to confirmatory factor models. The three-factor ESEM model showed a satisfactory model fit to the data but not for the two-factor model. The three factors were physical fatigue (three items, α = .800), low energy (four items, α = .821), and mental fatigue (four items, α = .861). The factors exhibited convergent validity with the model covariates and health measures. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the satisfactory reliability and convergent validity for the three-factor structure of the CFS as a valid measure of fatigue symptoms in the general population. Future psychometric studies could adopt the ESEM approach as a practical alternative to traditional confirmatory factor analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To report prevalence, correlates, and medication management of pain in community-dwelling older adults with dementia. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: In-person interviews with self- or proxy respondents living in private residences or non-nursing home residential care settings. PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative sample of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older enrolled in the National Health and Aging Trends Study 2011 wave. MEASUREMENTS: Dementia status was determined using a modified previously validated algorithm. Participants were asked whether they had had bothersome and activity-limiting pain over the past month. A multivariable Poisson regression model was used to determine the relationship between bothersome pain and sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 7,609 participants with complete data on cognitive function, 802 had dementia (67.2% aged ≥80, 65.0% female, 67.9% white, 49.7% proxy response, 32.0% lived alone, 18.8% lived in residential care); 670 (63.5%) participants with dementia experienced bothersome pain, and 347 (43.3%) had pain that limited activities. These rates were significantly higher than in a propensity score-matched cohort without dementia (54.5% bothersome pain, P < .001, 27.2% pain that limited activity, P < .001). Proxies reported slightly higher rates of pain than self-respondents, but differences were statistically significant only for activity-limiting pain (46.6% proxy vs 40.1% self, P = .03). Correlates of bothersome pain included arthritis, heart and lung disease, less than high school education, activity of daily living disability, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and low energy. Of those reporting pain, 30.3% stated that they rarely or never took any medications for pain. CONCLUSION: Community-living older adults with dementia are at high risk of having pain. Creative interventions and programs are needed to manage pain adequately in this vulnerable population.

T1  - Further statistical and clinical validity for the Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire-Short Form

AB  - Identifying barriers to long-term adherence to reduced energy intake and increased physical activity level is critically important for obese patients seeking weight loss treatment. Previous research has identified that one such barrier is low eating self-efficacy or poor confidence in one's ability to control eating behavior in the presence of challenging situations. Accordingly, a valid, brief measure of eating self-efficacy for longitudinal assessment of weight loss and regain is needed. The purpose of this study was to test the internal consistency and clinical validity of the Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire-Short Form (WEL-SF). Participants were 1740 consecutive obese patients who presented for a psychological evaluation in consideration for bariatric surgery. Median BMI was 44.9 (range: 35.0-111.9), age 48.7years (range: 18.9-77.3years), and patients were predominantly female (71.1%) and Caucasian (90.8%). The median WEL-SF total score was 56 (range: 0-80) and Cronbach's alpha measuring internal consistency was 0.92 with a one-factor structure. In terms of clinical validation, lower WEL-SF total scores were significantly associated with higher rates of binge eating episodes (P<0.0001), food addiction severity and dependence (P<0.0001), night eating syndrome (P<0.0001), depression (P<0.0001), and anxiety (P<0.0001). In contrast, higher WEL-SF total scores were associated with higher weight management self-efficacy (P<0.0001) and motivation to make positive lifestyle changes (P<0.0001). Taken together, these findings suggest that the WEL-SF is a psychometrically valid clinically meaningful measure of eating self-efficacy.

T1  - Clinical Significance of Cerebrovascular Biomarkers and White Matter Tract Integrity in Alzheimer Disease: Clinical correlations With Neurobehavioral Data in Cross-Sectional and After 18 Months Follow-ups

AB  - Cerebrovascular risk factors and white matter (WM) damage lead to worse cognitive performance in Alzheimer dementia (AD). This study investigated WM microstructure using diffusion tensor imaging in patients with mild to moderate AD and investigated specific fiber tract involvement with respect to predefined cerebrovascular risk factors and neurobehavioral data prediction cross-sectionally and after 18 months. To identify the primary pathoanatomic relationships of risk biomarkers to fiber tract integrity, we predefined 11 major association tracts and calculated tract specific fractional anisotropy (FA) values. Eighty-five patients with AD underwent neurobehavioral assessments including the minimental state examination (MMSE) and 12-item neuropsychiatric inventory twice with a 1.5-year interval to represent major outcome factors. In the cross-sectional data, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, vitamin B12, and homocysteine levels correlated variably with WM FA values. After entering the biomarkers and WM FA into a regression model to predict neurobehavioral outcomes, only fiber tract FA or homocysteine level predicted the MMSE score, and fiber tract FA or age predicted the neuropsychiatric inventory total scores and subdomains of apathy, disinhibition, and aberrant motor behavior. In the follow-up neurobehavioral data, the mean global FA value predicted the MMSE and aberrant motor behavior subdomain, while age predicted the anxiety and elation subdomains. Cerebrovascular risk biomarkers may modify WM microstructural organization, while the association with fiber integrity showed greater clinical significance to the prediction of neurobehavioral outcomes both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluated the potential of methylphenidate to improve antidepressant response to citalopram, as assessed by clinical and cognitive outcomes, in elderly depressed patients. METHOD: The authors conducted a 16-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial for geriatric depression in 143 older outpatients diagnosed with major depression comparing treatment response in three treatment groups: methylphenidate plus placebo (N=48), citalopram plus placebo (N=48), and citalopram plus methylphenidate (N=47). The primary outcome measure was change in depression severity. Remission was defined as a score of 6 or less on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes included measures of anxiety, apathy, quality of life, and cognition. RESULTS: Daily doses ranged from 20 mg to 60 mg for citalopram (mean=32 mg) and from 5 mg to 40 mg for methylphenidate (mean=16 mg). All groups showed significant improvement in depression severity and in cognitive performance. However, the improvement in depression severity and the Clinical Global Impressions improvement score was more prominent in the citalopram plus methylphenidate group compared with the other two groups. Additionally, the rate of improvement in the citalopram plus methylphenidate group was significantly higher than that in the citalopram plus placebo group in the first 4 weeks of the trial. The groups did not differ in cognitive improvement or number of side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment with citalopram and methylphenidate demonstrated an enhanced clinical response profile in mood and well-being, as well as a higher rate of remission, compared with either drug alone. All treatments led to an improvement in cognitive functioning, although augmentation with methylphenidate did not offer additional benefits.

T1  - The course of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia: a 3-year longitudinal study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1538-9375
Y1  - 2015/05/01
ET  - 2015/02/14
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Patients with dementia experience a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms. These symptoms often cause considerable distress to patients and caregivers, and often contribute to institutionalization. The current study examined the prevalence and course of neuropsychiatric symptoms in a large sample of patients with dementia attending memory clinics. DESIGN: Three-year nonprescriptive, observational study examining relationships between predictors and outcome variables in patients with dementia. SETTING: Nine memory clinics around Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Of 970 patients recruited, 779 patients had dementia at baseline. MEASUREMENTS: Over 3 years, patients were rated on 6 occasions on the 12-item Neuropsychiatric Inventory and measures of cognition, dementia severity, function, and medication use. Analyses focused on the 514 patients with dementia who completed the Neuropsychiatric Inventory on 4 or more occasions. RESULTS: Overall levels of neuropsychiatric symptoms increased over the 3 years. In particular, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, and aberrant motor behavior increased over the 3 years. Depression, euphoria, night time behavior, and appetite did not significantly increase over this period. Severity of dementia, male sex, and frontotemporal dementia were associated with greater levels of neuropsychiatric symptoms at baseline. Dementia with Lewy bodies was associated with more hallucinations and less appetite disturbances, and Alzheimer's disease was associated with lower levels of neuropsychiatric symptoms than other types of dementia at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirm that different symptoms have different trajectories and that baseline characteristics of patients, including sex and dementia type, predict the subsequent course of symptoms. The findings also highlight the association between dementia severity and neuropsychiatric symptoms, indicating the need to control for this variable when examining their longitudinal trajectories.

AB  - The "Ardouin Scale of Behavior in Parkinson's Disease" is a new instrument specifically designed for assessing mood and behavior with a view to quantifying changes related to Parkinson's disease, to dopaminergic medication, and to non-motor fluctuations. This study was aimed at analyzing the psychometric attributes of this scale in patients with Parkinson's disease without dementia. In addition to this scale, the following measures were applied: the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Lille Apathy Rating Scale, the Bech and Rafaelsen Mania Scale, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the MacElroy Criteria, the Patrick Carnes criteria, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Patients (n=260) were recruited at 13 centers across four countries (France, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States). Cronbach's alpha coefficient for domains ranged from 0.69 to 0.78. Regarding test-retest reliability, the kappa coefficient for items was higher than 0.4. For inter-rater reliability, the kappa values were 0.29 to 0.81. Furthermore, most of the items from the Ardouin Scale of Behavior in Parkinson's Disease correlated with the corresponding items of the other scales, depressed mood with the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (ρ=0.82); anxiety with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-anxiety (ρ=0.56); apathy with the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (ρ=0.60). The Ardouin Scale of Behavior in Parkinson's disease is an acceptable, reproducible, valid, and precise assessment for evaluating changes in behavior in patients with Parkinson's disease without dementia.

T1  - Low-grade inflammation differentiates between symptoms of apathy and depression in community-dwelling older individuals
LA  - eng
SN  - 1741-203X
Y1  - 2015/04/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic low-grade inflammation has repeatedly been associated with depression in old age, but the relationship with apathy is less clear. The present study assessed whether C-reactive protein (CRP) is differentially associated with symptoms of apathy and depression. METHODS: A population-based cohort study was carried-out. At baseline and after two and four years of follow-up, CRP levels were assessed and symptoms of apathy and depression were measured using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of CRP with symptoms of apathy and depression. RESULTS: Two thousand forty-seven community-dwelling participants (70-78 years) without a history of cardiovascular disease or stroke were studied. A cross-sectional association was found between CRP and apathy symptoms at three time points (odds ratio (OR) per natural log unit increase in CRP: baseline visit = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.12-1.75; two-year follow-up visit = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.17-2.25; four-year follow-up visit = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.03-2.21). This did not change after adjustment for demographics and depressive symptoms, and was slightly attenuated after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. No cross-sectional association was found with depressive symptoms. Baseline CRP did not predict incident apathy or depressive symptoms during four years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Increased CRP levels are associated with apathy symptoms but not with depressive symptoms. This suggests a differential effect of inflammation on apathy and depression. In older persons, symptoms of apathy may be a behavioral manifestation of concurrent low-grade inflammation.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this qualitative analysis was to establish the content validity of two new patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures: Sexual Arousal, Interest, and Drive Scale (SAID) and Hypogonadism Energy Diary (HED). METHODS: Four separate qualitative studies were conducted with 125 men with hypogonadism (mean age: 53 years, 85% adult onset). Study 1 used focus groups/interviews to identify important and relevant concepts related to the experience of hypogonadism and its treatment in men primarily with adult-onset hypogonadism. Study 2 tested items generated for assessments of low sex drive and low energy. Study 3 used interviews to confirm in men with early-onset hypogonadism that low sex drive and low energy were also important and relevant symptoms. Study 4 tested final versions of the two PROs and determined equivalency of paper-based and electronic versions of the two PROs. RESULTS: Of the concepts emerging in Studies 1 and 3, low sex drive and low energy were the symptoms most often spontaneously mentioned. Coding of transcripts from Studies 1 and 3 led to the generation of items for the SAID and HED. After item testing (Studies 2 and 4), the final SAID included five items pertaining to arousal, interest in sex and sex drive with a 7-day recall period and the final HED included two items (energy, tired/exhausted) to be administered three times per day. CONCLUSION: The SAID and HED have content validity established according to regulatory guidance and, therefore, the potential to provide the patient perspective of treatments for hypogonadism.

T1  - The psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of the Memorial Symptom Assessment scale (MSAS-Heb) in patients with breast cancer
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-6513
Y1  - 2015/04/
ET  - 2014/09/28
AB  - CONTEXT: To date, no report of the psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS-Heb) has been available, which may be a barrier to comprehensively assessing symptom frequency, severity, and distress in Israeli patients with cancer. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to translate the MSAS into Hebrew and to evaluate the psychometric properties in Israeli patients with cancer. METHODS: The original 32-item MSAS was translated into Hebrew using the forward and backward procedure, and administered to female patients with early stage breast cancer (stages I-IIIA) who had received adjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, patients completed a demographic questionnaire, the Lee Fatigue Scale, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, the General Sleep Disturbance Scale, a numeric rating scale for pain intensity, the Multidimensional Quality of Life Scale-Cancer and the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale. RESULTS: A sample of 110 patients was recruited (mean age 45.5 ± 10.1 years). The most frequent symptoms were hair loss (96.4%), lack of energy (88.2%) and "I do not look like myself" (80.9%), and the most infrequent were vomiting (7.3%), problems with urination (10.9%), and shortness of breath (20.9%). Cronbach alpha coefficients for the MSAS-Heb subscales (i.e., physical, psychological and global distress index) ranged from 0.78 to 0.90. All MSAS-Heb subscales and all the other questionnaires used in this study were significantly correlated (P < 0.0001), with expected directions. CONCLUSION: The MSAS-Heb is a valid and a reliable measure and should be a useful tool in the clinical arena and in future studies for evaluation of multiple symptoms in Israeli patients with cancer.

AB  - CONTEXT: The prevalence of sexual dysfunction, low vitality, and poor physical function increases with aging, as does the prevalence of low total and free testosterone (TT and FT) levels. However, the relationship between sex hormones and age-related alterations in older men is not clear. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses that baseline serum TT, FT, estradiol (E2), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels are independently associated with sexual function, vitality, and physical function in older symptomatic men with low testosterone levels participating in the Testosterone Trials (TTrials). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of baseline measures in the TTrials. SETTING: The study was conducted at 12 sites in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: The 788 TTrials participants were ≥ 65 years and had evidence of sexual dysfunction, diminished vitality, and/or mobility disability, and an average of two TT < 275 ng/dL. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Question 4 of Psychosocial Daily Questionnaire (PDQ-Q4), the FACIT-Fatigue Scale, and the 6-minute walk test. RESULTS: Baseline serum TT and FT, but not E2 or SHBG levels had small, but statistically significant associations with validated measures of sexual desire, erectile function, and sexual activity. None of these hormones was significantly associated within or across trials with FACIT-Fatigue, PHQ-9 Depression or Physical Function-10 scores, or gait speed. CONCLUSIONS: FT and TT levels were consistently, independently, and positively associated, albeit to a small degree, with measures of sexual desire, erectile function, and sexual activity, but not with measures of vitality or physical function in symptomatic older men with low T who qualified for the TTrials.

T1  - Deficiency of brain structural sub-network underlying post-ischaemic stroke apathy
LA  - eng
SN  - 1468-1331
Y1  - 2015/02/
ET  - 2014/10/16
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study aimed to reveal the structural basis of post-ischaemic stroke apathy, especially in relation to disruptions in structural connectivity. METHODS: Eighty-eight participants were included. The Apathy Evaluation Scale, clinician version, was used to characterize the severity of apathy. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography was used to examine white matter integrity and to reconstruct white matter networks using 90 nodes based on the automated anatomical labeling atlas. The degree for each node was extracted to determine the relationship to the severity of apathy. RESULTS: Apathy was not significantly associated with damage to any single brain region. The degrees of 24 nodes (limbic system, three nodes; frontal lobe, six; basal ganglia, two; temporal lobe, three; parietal lobe, three; insula, two; occipital lobe, five) were significantly correlated to the Apathy Evaluation Scale scores. These 24 nodes constituted an apathy-related sub-network and its global and local efficiencies were negatively correlated with apathy levels (global, r = -0.54, P < 0.01; local, r = -0.64, P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that decreased global efficiency of this sub-network was an independent risk factor for apathy (odds ratio 0.03, 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.04, P = 0.007). Efficiencies of the non-apathy-related sub-network (the remaining 66 nodes) did not correlate or predict the presence of apathy. CONCLUSIONS: Post-stroke apathy is not due to the dysfunction of a single region or circuit. Rather, it results from disconnection of a complex sub-network of brain regions. This provides new insights into the neuroanatomical basis of post-stroke apathy.

T1  - Sexual activity and functioning in ovarian cancer survivors: an internet-based evaluation
LA  - eng
SN  - 1473-0804
Y1  - 2015/02/
ET  - 2014/07/16
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sexual dysfunction is a known complication of treatment for many cancers, but there have been relatively few studies investigating outcomes for ovarian cancer survivors. We have previously reported that women treated for ovarian cancer experience persistent psychological and physical problems. Sexual functioning was highlighted as a significant factor and we sought to investigate this further. METHODS: Women were invited to complete a questionnaire using both paper and online response formats. A validated tool, the Sexual Activity Questionnaire, was used to obtain information from women following a diagnosis of ovarian cancer. RESULTS: Across all responders (n = 102, mean age 51.3 years), 63% of women reported their ovarian cancer diagnosis had negatively changed their sex life. The most common reasons given for an absence of sexual activity were a lack of interest in sex, physical problems that prevented sex or no partner. Of the 46% of responders who stated they were sexually active, 77% reported pain or discomfort during intercourse and 87% described vaginal dryness. CONCLUSION: For the majority of women, treatment for ovarian cancer negatively impacts on their sex lives. Many of the symptoms described by participants are potentially reversible and clinicians should be open to raising the issue of sexual functioning with their patients.

T1  - Relationship between apathy and cognitive dysfunctions in de novo untreated Parkinson's disease: a prospective longitudinal study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1468-1331
Y1  - 2015/02/
ET  - 2014/05/22
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Apathy may be either a symptom of major depression or a behavioral disturbance occurring in concomitance with depression or alone in Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of the present study was to determine the progression of cognitive impairment in drug-naïve untreated PD patients with or without clinically significant apathy. METHODS: Sixty-two PD patients with a disease duration <2 years and without history of present or past therapy with pro-dopaminergic agents were included and underwent the Apathy Evaluation Scale (S-AES), a clinical interview based on diagnostic criteria for apathy and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery to assess memory, frontal functions and visuospatial functions. Two years after the first assessment, all patients were re-evaluated on the S-AES, a clinical interview and neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: According to the cut-off value of the S-AES and diagnostic criteria for apathy, eight patients experienced apathy at both baseline and follow-up (A+A+), nine patients had apathy only at follow-up (A-A+), 37 patients never experienced apathy (A-A-) and eight patients showed apathy at the baseline only (A+A-). Cognitive performance significantly declined in all four groups. At both baseline and follow-up A+A+ performed worse than A-A- on visuospatial and frontal tests; A-A+ had lower scores than A-A- on the interference task of the Stroop test (IT-ST). Regression analysis showed that poor performance on the IT-ST at baseline was the only independent predictor of onset of apathy at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated a relationship between apathy and dysexecutive syndrome in early PD. Reduced scores on the IT-ST may predict development of apathy in PD patients.

T1  - A novel rating scale for the measurement of apathy in institutionalized persons with dementia: the APADEM-NH
LA  - eng
SN  - 1545-7214
Y1  - 2015/02/
ET  - 2013/07/17
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Apathy is one of the most frequent symptoms of dementia, still needing better measurement methods. The objective of this study was to validate a new scale for apathy in institutionalized persons with dementia (APADEM-NH). METHODS: The scale includes 26 items distributed in three dimensions: Deficit of Thinking and Self-Generated behaviors (DT): 13 items, Emotional Blunting (EB): 7 items, and Cognitive Inertia (CI): 6 items. The sample included 100 institutionalized patients (90% female) with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) (57%), possible AD (13%), AD + cerebral vascular disease (17%), Lewy body dementia (11%), and Parkinson associated to dementia (2%), covering all stages of dementia severity according to the Global Deterioration Scale and Clinical Dementia Rating. Additional assessments were the Apathy Inventory, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Cornell Scale for Depression, and the tested scale. Re-test and inter-rater reliability were carried out in 50 patients. RESULTS: All subscales lacked relevant floor and ceiling effects (<15%). Internal consistency for each dimension was (Cronbach's α): DT = 0.88, EB = 0.83, CI = 0.88; item-total correlations were >0.40; and item homogeneity 0.36-0.51. Test-retest reliability for the items was kW = 0.48-0.92; for the subscales, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.80-0.88; and for the total score, ICC = 0.90. Inter-rater reliability reached kW values of 0.84-1.00; subscales ICC, 0.97-0.99, and total score ICC, 0.99. Standard error of measurement for total score was 6.41 and internal validity ranged from rS = 0.69-0.80. CONCLUSIONS: APADEM-NH proved to be feasible, reliable, and valid for apathy assessment in institutionalized patients suffering mild to severe dementia, discerning well between apathy and depression.

T1  - Severity of core symptoms in first episode schizophrenia and long-term remission
LA  - eng
SN  - 1872-7123
Y1  - 2015/01/30
ET  - 2014/11/11
AB  - A definable concept of symptomatic remission in schizophrenia has been proposed by the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group (RSWG). Nevertheless no studies to date assessed eventual differences in core symptoms at onset between remitters and non-remitters. The present study evaluated whether the severity of core symptoms differed among 48 patients with first episode schizophrenia (FES), and whether it predicted long-term (16-years) remission. Particularly, the present study aimed to verify if RSWG remission criteria might identify a sub-group of patients with mild core symptoms at their first episode. In the present study the severity of core symptoms was significantly lower in remitted than in non-remitted patients; interestingly, five out of the eight core symptoms already satisfied the severity criteria for remission in most remitted patients. Among the core symptoms only the severity of social withdrawal predicted the long-term outcome, while age at onset, duration of untreated psychosis and employment status did not exert any effect. Concluding, patients with FES presenting, mild core symptoms, particularly low negative symptoms, were more likely to reach long-term remission. Therefore, RSWG remission criteria seem to identify a subgroup of FES patients with mild severe core symptoms so with a higher probability to reach remission.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric Symptoms Predict Functional Status in Alzheimer's Disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-8908
SN  - 1387-2877
Y1  - 2015
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive deficits are presumed to be the primary driver of functional impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, functional impairment is likely multifactorially determined. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the relative contribution of neuropsychiatric symptoms in predicting ratings of functional status. METHODS: A total of 223 patients received routine neurological and neuropsychological evaluations and met criteria of probable AD dementia based on the McKhann criteria. Demographic, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric variables were entered in a hierarchical linear regression analysis to predict functional status as measured by the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). RESULTS: The total model explained 29.7% of the variance (p <  0.001) in FAQ. Importantly, neuropsychiatric variables explained 12.7% of the unique variance, with apathy and sleep as significant contributors. CONCLUSION: Two neuropsychiatric variables, apathy and changes in sleep/nighttime behaviors, predicted ratings of functional status in AD patients independent of age, global cognition, memory and executive function measures, and depressive symptoms. These results highlight the importance of neuropsychiatric symptoms in understanding and potentially treating the functional limitations so prevalent in AD.

T1  - The Apathy Evaluation Scale: A Comparison of Subject, Informant, and Clinician Report in Cognitively Normal Elderly and Mild Cognitive Impairment
LA  - eng

SN  - 1387-2877
Y1  - 2015
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a common neuropsychiatric symptom in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Detecting apathy accurately may facilitate earlier diagnosis of AD. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is a promising tool for measurement of apathy in prodromal and possibly preclinical AD. OBJECTIVE: To compare the three AES sub-scales - subject-reported (AES-S), informant-reported (AES-I), and clinician-reported (AES-C) - over time in individuals at risk for AD due to MCI and advanced age (cognitively normal [CN] elderly). METHODS: Mixed effects longitudinal models were used to assess predictors of score for each AES sub-scale. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess which AES sub-scales predict progression from MCI to AD dementia. RESULTS: Fifty-seven MCI and 18 CN subjects (ages 53-86) were followed for 1.4 ± 1.2 years and 0.7 ± 0.7 years, respectively. Across the three mixed effects longitudinal models, the common findings were associations between greater apathy and greater years in study, a baseline diagnosis of MCI (compared to CN), and male gender. CN elderly self-reported greater apathy compared to that reported by informants and clinicians, while individuals with MCI under-reported their apathy compared to informants and clinicians. Of the three sub-scales, the AES-C best predicted transition from MCI to AD dementia. CONCLUSION: In a sample of CN elderly and elderly with MCI, apathy increased over time, particularly in men and those with MCI. AES-S scores may be more sensitive than AES-I and AES-C scores in CN elderly, but less reliable if subjects have MCI. Moreover, the AES-C sub-scale predicted progression from MCI to AD dementia.

T1  - Rating Apathy in Huntington’s Disease: Patients and Companions Agree
LA  - eng
SN  - 1879-6397
Y1  - 2015
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a common feature of Huntington’s disease (HD), even from early disease. However, patients are believed to lack insight into their own apathy and therefore clinicians and/or companions are relied upon to estimate the extent of a patient’s apathy. In addition, the evolution of apathy over time in HD has not been unequivocally established. OBJECTIVEs: The purpose of this study was to determine whether HD patient’s self-rated apathy scores were consistent with the scores given by companions who were also asked to rate the patients apathy. Furthermore, the clinical correlates of apathy and its stability over time were examined for both self-rated and companion-rated scores. METHODs: Apathy was measured in a large cross-sectional population of HD patients ranging from early to late stage disease (n = 106) using the Apathy Evaluation Scale; a subgroup of whom were followed longitudinally (n = 62) on average 18.7 (1.2 SD) months later. Comparisons were made between self-rated and companion-rated apathy and the relationship between apathy and motor, cognitive and functional performance was explored. RESULTS: Analysis of the cross-sectional data revealed that self-rated and companion-rated apathy were highly correlated, establishing the validity of using self-rated instead of, or in combination with, companion-rated assessments of apathy in future studies. Both self-rated and companion-rated scores had a relationship with motor and functional impairment, but had a complex relationship with cognition. The results of the longitudinal comparison revealed that apathy did not change over time in this cohort.CONCLUSIONs: Apathy can be equally well assessed by either patients or companions and does not change significantly over an18 month period. These findings have implications in the design of studies looking at treating this important aspect of HD.

T1  - Depression comorbid to ischemic heart disease: a psychometric and molecular-genetic study
LA  - rus
SN  - 1997-7298
Y1  - 2015
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare psychometric and molecular-genetic characteristics of depression caused by ischemic heart disease (IHD) and depression in patients with IHD caused by other psychogenic factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty-five patients with depression comorbid to ischemic heart disease (IHD) were examined. Depression was associated with IHD in 71 patients (group 1). In 64 patients, depression was caused by other psychogenic factors (group 2). The HAMD-21 scale was used to measure depressive symptoms. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The comparative analysis of the core symptoms of depression demonstrated that group 1 had a peculiar psychometric profile with marked apathy, which was not accompanied by marked hypothymia, guilt feelings or anxiety, compared to group 2. The molecular-genetic correlate of this profile was found. It included a combination of an allele S (5-HTTLPR) of the serotonin transporter gene, an allele G (A-1438G) of the serotonin receptor type 2A gene and the genotype ValVal (Val66Met) of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene.

T1  - Computerized touch-panel screening tests for detecting mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1349-7235
Y1  - 2015
ET  - 2015/04/15
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The increasing population of elderly people in Japan has accelerated the demand for a simple screening test to detect cognitive and affective declines in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the early stage of dementia. Methods We compared the cognitive and affective functions, activities of daily living (ADLs) and the results of four computerized touch-panel screening tests in 41 MCI subjects, 124 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 75 age- and gender-matched normal controls. RESULTS: All computerized touch-panel games were successfully used to discriminate the AD patients from the normal controls (** p<0.01). Although there were no differences in the findings of the conventional cognitive assessments, the results of the flipping cards game were significantly different (** p<0.01) between the normal controls (19.3 ± 9.5 sec) and MCI subjects (30.9 ± 18.4 sec). Three conventional affective assessments, the ADL score, Abe's behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (ABS) (** p<0.01) and the apathy scale (AS) (* p<0.05), could be used to discriminate the MCI subjects (ABS, 0.9 ± 1.5; AS, 12.8 ± 5.9) from the normal controls (ABS, 0.1 ± 0.4; AS, 8.9 ± 5.3). CONCLUSION: In the present study, all four touch-panel screening tests could be employed to discriminate AD patients from normal controls, whereas only the flipping cards game was effective for distinguishing MCI subjects from normal controls. Therefore, this novel touch-panel screening test may be a more sensitive tool for detecting MCI subjects among elderly patients.

T1  - Burden of Behavioral and Psychiatric Symptoms in People Screened Positive for Dementia in Primary Care: Results of the DelpHi-Study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-8908
Y1  - 2015
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited knowledge about the range and effects of neuropsychiatric symptoms shown by persons with dementia (PWD) living in the community and their related caregiver burden. OBJECTIVE: To examine neuropsychiatric symptoms in PWD in primary care with regard to frequency, severity, and burden to caregiver; to compare PWD with and without symptoms with regard to sociodemographics, care-related, and disease-related variables; and to identify variables associated with symptoms. METHODS: A general physician-based epidemiological cohort of 248 people screened positive for dementia over the age of 70 (living at home) and their caregivers, was assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Interview (NPI), sociodemographics, and disease-related variables. RESULTS: In preliminary analyses, neuropsychiatric symptoms were frequent in PWD. Prevalence numbers ofdysphoria/depression, apathy, and agitation/aggression were each more than 30% . The severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms in people screened positive for dementia in primary care is moderate with a mean NPI score of m = 11.91 (SD = 16.0). Overall, caregiver distress is low, indicated by a total distress score of m = 5.94 (SD = 7.2, range 0-39). Common or frequent symptoms are not necessarily the most distressing symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in people screened positive for dementia in primary care. While frequency, severity, and perceived distress might be low in the total sample, we identified the dimensions delusions, aggression, anxiety, disinhibition, and depression to be perceived "severely" to "extremely" distressing in more than 30% of the caregivers affected. The association between activities of daily living and symptoms needs further attention.

AB  - Although major depressive disorder (MDD) has a variety of symptoms beyond the affective dimensions, the factor structure and contents of comprehensive psychiatric symptoms of this disorder have rarely been explored using the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). We aimed to identify the factor structure of the 18-item BPRS in Korean MDD patients. A total of 258 MDD patients were recruited from a multicenter sample of the Clinical Research Center for Depression of South Korea study. Psychometric scales were used to assess overall psychiatric symptoms (BPRS), depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), global severity (Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale), suicidal ideation (Scale for Suicide Ideation), functioning (Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale), and quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment-abbreviated version). Common factor analysis with oblique rotation was used to yield factor structure. A four-factor structure was designed and interpreted by the symptom dimensions to reflect mood disturbance, positive symptoms/apathy, bipolarity, and thought distortion/mannerism. These individual factors were also significantly correlated with clinical variables. The findings of this study support the view that the BPRS may be a promising measuring tool for the initial assessment of MDD patients. In addition, the four-factor structure of the BPRS may be useful in understanding the mood and psychotic characteristics of these patients.

T1  - Development and evaluation of a short version of the quality of life questionnaire for dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 1741-203X
Y1  - 2015/01/
ET  - 2014/08/27
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are many quality of life (QOL) instruments for evaluating dementia patients. The QOL questionnaire for Dementia (QOL-D) is one of such instruments and a validated objective measure of QOL for patients with dementia. It comprises 31 items encompassing six domains. However, with 31 items, its length is a disadvantage. The purpose of this study was to develop a short version of QOL-D (short QOL-D). METHODS: We used data from two studies. The participants were 264 inpatients with dementia in the first sample and 395 outpatients at a memory clinic in the second sample. We used maximum likelihood factor analysis with promax rotation to reduce the number of items. RESULTS: We produced a nine-item version of QOL-D (short QOL-D) with positive (six items) and negative (three items) dimensions. The correlation coefficients of short and total versions of QOL-D were 0.892-0.918 for total scores, 0.903-0.936 for positive dimension scores, and 0.788-0.837 for negative dimension scores. Total short QOL-D scores showed a significant correlation to the Geriatric Depression Scale score and the apathy score of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. CONCLUSIONS: The short QOL-D produced results comparable with that of the full version. Reducing the number of items may make administration of the instrument easier.

T1  - Apathy in untreated, de novo patients with Parkinson's disease: validation study of Apathy Evaluation Scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 1432-1459
Y1  - 2014/12/
ET  - 2014/09/17
AB  - Apathy is a behavioural disturbance occurring alone or in concomitance with depression in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we present a validation study for the self-report version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-S), carried out in a sample of 60 non-demented, non-depressed untreated, drug-naïve, de novo PD patients; 20 patients of the sample (33.3%) were classified as apathetic according to current clinical criteria. All enrolled patients completed the AES-S and a neurological and cognitive assessment. Mean AES-S score was 34.43. AES-S did not show floor or ceiling effect. Cronbach's alpha was 0.872. Principal component analysis revealed three factors: the first (34.4% of the variance) represented constitutive aspects of the construct of apathy; the second (8.5% of the variance) represented a social dimension; the third factor (7.9% of the variance) represented a dimension related to insight. With respect to clinical criteria for apathy considered as the gold standard, receiver operating characteristics curve analysis showed that a cut-off of 36/37 has the maximum discrimination power. High sensitivity and negative predictive values were obtained with cut-off scores of 33/34 or lower; high specificity and positive predictive values were obtained with cut-off scores of 38/39 or higher. AES-S score correlated with scores on frontal tasks, but not on Beck Depression Inventory, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr scale. The AES-S is a reliable and valid questionnaire for detecting apathy in PD. For screening purposes a 33/34 cut-off score is indicated, but a 38/39 cut-off score is necessary when a high specificity is desired.

T1  - The cognition and emotional well-being indices of the Parkinson's disease questionnaire-39: what do they really measure?
LA  - eng

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Parkinson's disease questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) is a common measure of health related quality of life (HRQoL) that is widely used with Parkinson disease (PD) patients. Previous evidence suggests that the PDQ-39 reflects at least 8 dimensions (i.e., Emotion, Cognitions, Mobility, etc). To date, little research has examined the external/convergent validity of the Cognitions and Emotional Well-being domains of the PDQ-39. METHODS: A convenience sample of 303 PD patients underwent a comprehensive multi-domain neuropsychological evaluation, including tests of execution function, episodic verbal memory, processing speed, language and working memory, as well as completing measures of depression, apathy, state and trait anxiety and HRQoL (PDQ-39). Hierarchical regressions were conducted in order to examine the relationship between scores on neuropsychological tests and the Cognitions index, as well as mood measures and the Emotional Well-being index of the PDQ-39. RESULTS: Neuropsychological test performance did not account for a significant amount of variance in the PDQ-39 Cognitions index scores. Instead, it was depression that significantly contributed to the Cognitions index, above and beyond neuropsychological performance. The PDQ-39 Emotional Well-being index was also related to mood measures, primarily depression and trait anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The PDQ-39 Cognition index may be more related to mood functioning, as opposed to cognitive functioning, and should not be considered a "proxy" for cognitive functioning. Future studies are needed to better explain the construct of this index.

T1  - Loneliness in middle and old age: demographics, perceived health, and social satisfaction as predictors
LA  - eng
SN  - 1872-6976
Y1  - 2014///Nov-Dec
ET  - 2014/07/07
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH: (a) To identify the degree of much loneliness reported in the Portuguese population over 50 years of age and (b) test whether loneliness can be predicted by socio-demographic, health related or social characteristic of the sample other than age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1174 late middle age and older adults were interviewed face to face by different interviewers across the country; after the informed consent was signed, we asked the participants several socio-demographic and health-related questions; finally we asked "How often do you feel lonely?" and participants responded according to a five point Likert scale. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: The results showed that 12% of participants reporting feeling lonely often or always, whereas 40% reporting never feeling lonely. The remaining 48% self-reported they felt lonely seldom or sometimes. Additionally, results show that, when taken together, variables such as marital status, type of housing, residence settings, health conditions, social satisfaction, social isolation, lack of interest, transportation, and age were predictors of loneliness. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: (1) The association of loneliness with advanced age has been greatly exaggerated by mass media and common sense; (2) But although our findings did not confirm the most alarmist views, the 12% of older adults reporting that they are feeling lonely always or often should be cause for attention and concern. It is necessary to understand the meaning, reasons and level of suffering implied on those feelings of loneliness. (3) Our findings suggest that it makes no sense to construe age as a singular feature or cause for feelings of loneliness. Instead, age and also a number of other features combine to predict feelings of loneliness. But even with our predictor variables there was a substantial of variance left unexplained. Therefore it is necessary to continue exploring how feelings of loneliness arise from the experience of living and how they can be changed.

T1  - Assessment of fatigue using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory in patients with major depressive disorder

SN  - 1532-8384
Y1  - 2014/10/
ET  - 2014/06/13
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There are problems with the fatigue measures currently used in depressed patients. The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) covering general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced activity and reduced motivation has been widely used in patients with cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome. To address the multidimensional nature of fatigue, we examined the validity and reliability of a Chinese version of the MFI-20 in major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: Data were derived from a randomized controlled trial of acupuncture in 137 patients with partially remitted MDD. The test-retest reliability, internal consistency, construct and concurrent validity and sensitivity to change of the MFI-20 were analyzed. RESULTS: The MFI-20 was found to have good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.89) and 1-week test-retest reliability (Pearson correlation of the total score=0.73). Factor analysis showed 5 factors, but the factor structure was different from that in medical conditions. The 2 most prominent factors, explaining 46% of the total variance, were both associated with physical and mental energy but different in directions. There were adequate concurrent validity and sensitivity to change as evidenced by the significant correlations between the MFI-20 scores and depressive and anxiety symptoms, general health and quality of life. CONCLUSION: The Chinese MFI-20 is a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of fatigue in MDD patients with residual symptoms. The construct of fatigue in MDD seems to be different from that in medical conditions. Further studies are needed to examine the MFI-20 in MDD patients from other cultures.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric disturbance after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
LA  - eng
SN  - 1532-2653
Y1  - 2014/10/
ET  - 2014/06/11
AB  - Although aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) accounts for only 3-5% of all strokes, a high degree of morbidity has been reported in this relatively young subset of patients. Neuropsychiatric disturbance has often been neglected in these reports. We aimed to investigate the pattern and pathological factors of chronic neuropsychiatric disturbance in aSAH patients. This cross-sectional observational four-center study was carried out in Hong Kong. Neuropsychiatric outcome (Neuropsychiatric Inventory Chinese Version [CNPI]) assessments were conducted cross-sectionally 1-4 years after ictus. Pathological factors considered were early brain injury as assessed by admission World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade, aneurysm treatment (clipping versus coiling), delayed cerebral infarction, and chronic hydrocephalus. One hundred and three aSAH patients' spouses or caregivers completed the CNPI. Forty-two (41%) patients were reported to have one or more domain(s) of neuropsychiatric disturbance. Common neuropsychiatric disturbance domains included agitation/aggression, depression, apathy/indifference, irritability/lability, and appetite/eating disturbance. Chronic neuropsychiatric disturbance was associated with presence of chronic hydrocephalus. A subscore consisting of the five commonly affected domains seems to be a suitable tool for aSAH patients and should be further validated and replicated in future studies.

T1  - Psychometric properties of the Polish version of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 in cancer patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-6513
Y1  - 2014/10/
ET  - 2014/03/27
AB  - CONTEXT: Multidimensional questionnaires estimating cancer-related fatigue (CRF) as a symptom cluster or a clinical syndrome primarily have been used and validated in English-speaking populations. However, cultural issues and language peculiarities can affect CRF assessment OBJECTIVES: The main aims of this study were to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Polish version of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 (MFI-20) and to deliver to clinicians a multidimensional tool for CRF assessment in Polish-speaking patients with cancer. METHODS: After forward-backward translation procedures, the Polish version of MFI-20 was administered to 340 cancer patients. The Polish MFI-20 was appraised in terms of acceptability, reliability, and validity. Internal consistency was assessed by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficients. Structural validity was evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis. RESULTS: The translated MFI-20 was well accepted; 90% of subjects fully completed the questionnaire. The overall Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.9, ranging from 0.57 to 0.81. All correlation coefficients among Numeric Rating Scale-fatigue, fatigue-related items from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core-30 questionnaire, and the MFI--20 were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated good structural validity and revealed only three dimensions in the Polish version of the MFI-20-physical and mental fatigue as well as reduced motivation. CONCLUSION: The Polish version of the MFI-20 is well accepted by patients, reliable, and a valid instrument to assess CRF in Polish cancer patients.

T1  - Issues patients would like to discuss at their review consultation in breast cancer clinics--a cross-sectional survey
LA  - eng
SN  - 2038-2529
Y1  - 2014///Sep-Oct
AB  - AIMS AND BACKGROUND: In breast cancer (BC) there are different therapies available with different side effects affecting the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients. Here we report a novel tool, the BC-specific Patient Concerns Inventory (PCI). This work includes a survey that is part of the validation process to allow a larger cohort and comparisons with clinical characteristics. We report the concerns that BC patients would like to discuss in the outpatient clinic - using the PCI - and also their choice of multidisciplinary team members they would like to see. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: We carried out a cross-sectional survey - using the BC-specific PCI, the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC BC QLQ-BR23 - of patients who had completed their initial treatment and were attending a review outpatient clinic. 249 patients were recruited from February to July 2012. RESULTS: Survey responses were obtained from 80% (200/249). The three most frequent items were fear of cancer coming back (62%, 124), breast sensitivity/pain (46%, 92), and fatigue/tiredness and low energy levels overall (46%, 92). The most frequently selected members of the multidisciplinary team that patients wished to see were the breast care nurse (46%, 92), the medical oncologist (28%, 55) and the psychologist (20%, 40). CONCLUSIONS: The PCI provides the opportunity for multiprofessional engagement across a range of issues specific to BC. It can identify issues relating to physical, psychological, sexual and social functioning, as well as issues relating to body image and lifestyle.

T1  - Life concerns of elderly people living at home determined as by Community General Support Center staff: implications for organizing a more effective integrated community care system. The Kurihara Project
LA  - eng
SN  - 1479-8301
Y1  - 2014/09/
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Japan, the integrated community care system aims to enable people to continue to live in their homes. Based on the concept, one of the activities of a Community General Support Center (CGSC) is to provide preventive intervention based on a Community Support Program. Currently, a Basic Checklist (BC) is sent to elderly people to identify persons appropriate for a Secondary Prevention Program. METHODS: To find people who had not responded to the BC, CGSC staff evaluated the files of 592 subjects who had participated in the Kurihara Project to identify activities they cannot do that they did in the past, decreased activity levels at home, loss of interaction with people other than their family, and the need for medical interventions. This information was classified, when applicable, into the following categories: (A) 'no life concerns'; (B) 'undecided'; and (C) 'life concerns'. The relationships between these classifications and clinical information, certified need for long-term care, and items on the BC were examined. RESULTS: The numbers of subjects in categories A, B, and C were 291, 42, and 186, respectively. Life concerns were related to scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating, global cognitive function, depressive state, and apathy. Most items on the BC were not associated with classification into category C, but ≥25% of the subjects had life concerns related to these items. DISCUSSION: Assessment of life concerns by the CGSC staff has clinical validity. The results suggest that there are people who do not respond to the checklist or apply for Long-Term Care Insurance, meaning that they 'hide' in the community, probably due to apathy or depressive state. To organize a more effective integrated community care system, the CGSC staff should focus mainly on preventive care.

T1  - Motivational deficits and cognitive test performance in schizophrenia
LA  - eng
SN  - 2168-6238
Y1  - 2014/09/
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Motivational and cognitive deficits are core features of schizophrenia, both closely linked with functional outcomes. Although poor effort and decreased motivation are known to affect performance on cognitive tests, the extent of this relationship is unclear in patients with schizophrenia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between intrinsic motivation and cognitive test performance in patients with schizophrenia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional and 6-month prospective follow-up study performed at 57 sites in the United States, including academic and community medical treatment centers, participating in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness study. The primary sample included 431 stable patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia currently receiving a stable medication regimen. INTERVENTIONS: Cognitive performance and intrinsic motivation were evaluated using a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and a derived measure from the Heinrichs-Carpenter Quality of Life Scale, respectively. Symptom severity and functional status were also assessed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome variable was global neurocognition. Individual domains of cognition were also evaluated for their association with motivation. RESULTS: Level of intrinsic motivation was significantly and positively correlated with global cognitive test performance, a relationship that held for each domain of cognition evaluated (correlation range, 0.20-0.34; P < .001). This association was found to be reliable after statistically accounting for positive, negative, depressive, and overall symptom severity (P < .05) and after accounting for community functioning (P < .001). The relationship between motivation and cognitive performance also remained significant after controlling for antipsychotic dose (P < .05). Prospective increase in motivation during the 6-month follow-up was also found to be significantly related to improvement in global cognitive performance (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The present findings provide strong support for a robust and reliable relationship between motivation and cognitive performance and suggest that test performance is not purely a measure of ability. Future studies assessing cognition in patients with schizophrenia should consider potential moderating variables such as effort and motivation. Implications for the assessment and interpretation of cognitive impairment based on neuropsychological test measures in schizophrenia are discussed, especially in the case of clinical trials for cognition-enhancing treatments.

LA  - dut
SN  - 0167-9228

AB  - The Participation Scale was developed as an observational measure of activity engagement (as rated by group facilitators) of adult day care clients with mild to moderate dementia. In a consecutive sample of 448 subjects Mokken scaling procedure was conducted to assess the latent structure of 27 questionnaire items. The study included an exploratory and a confirmatory approach. For that purpose the sample was randomly divided into two halves. Exploratory analysis revealed three dimensions of participation that adequately captured the item structure: motivation (10 items; Loevinger's H = 0.48), competence (7 items; H = 0.56) and self-confidence (4 items; H = 0.57). The structure was validated in a confirmatory analysis. In a stepwise multiple regression model 49% of the variance in motivation was explained by independent behavioural measures of apathy and affect. Apathy and cognitive impairment were significant predictors of competence in participation (R(2) = 31.2%). Negative affect was the main predictor of reduced self-confidence (R(2) = 37.9%). Cross-validation of these exploratory regression models on the confirmatory sample explained 39.6%, 29.2% and 23.1% of the variance in motivation, competence and self-confidence, respectively. Test-retest intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC2(A,1)) as determined in a random subsample of 56 participants, were 0.77 (motivation), 0.85 (competence) and 0.76 (self-confidence). The three measures allow the differentiation and ordering of individual participants on separate dimensions of activity engagement in psychogeriatric day care.

T1  - Calibration and validation of the Physical Activity Barrier Scale for persons who are blind or visually impaired
LA  - eng
SN  - 1876-7583
Y1  - 2014/07/
ET  - 2014/02/20
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is critical to employ accurate measures when assessing physical activity (PA) barriers in any subpopulation, yet existing measures are not appropriate for persons with blindness or visual impairment (PBVI) due to a lack of validity or reliability evidence. OBJECTIVE: To develop and calibrate a PA barrier scale for PBVI. METHODS: An expert panel (n = 3) and 18 PBVI were recruited to establish content validity for a PA barriers subscale; 160 PBVI (96 females) completed the scale along with the Physical Activity Scale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities for calibration. To establish construct-related validity evidence, Confirmative factor analysis (CFA) and Rasch analysis were applied. To investigate internal consistency and reliability, Cronbach's alpha and the reliability coefficient (R) were employed, respectively. RESULTS: Following CFA and Rasch analyses, five items were eliminated due to misfits; reliability coefficients were unchanged upon deletion of these items. The barriers perceived by PBVI to have the most negative impact on PA included "lack of self-discipline" (logit = 1.40) and "lack of motivation" (logit = 1.27). "Too many stairs in the exercise facility" (logit = -1.49) was perceived to have the least impact. CONCLUSIONS: The newly-developed scale was found to be a valid and reliable tool for evaluating PA barriers in PBVI. To enhance promotion of health-producing levels of PA in PBVI, practitioners should consider applying this new tool as a precursor to programs aimed at improving PA participation in this group.

T1  - A novel tool to detect behavioural symptoms in ALS
LA  - eng
SN  - 2167-9223
Y1  - 2014/06/
AB  - There is need for a valid, sensitive and short instrument capable of detecting and quantifying behavioural changes in ALS, which can be utilized in clinical and research settings. This study aimed to 1) develop and validate such an instrument; 2) verify the most common behavioural symptoms; and 3) investigate longitudinal changes over a six-month period. Two hundred and nineteen patients were included. The development sample (n = 140) was used to determine the most appropriate items to include in the new tool, the Motor Neuron Disease Behavioural Instrument (MiND-B) * , via a data-driven approach. An independent sample (n = 79) validated the tool. A more comprehensive sample (n = 50, sub-classified into ALS and ALS plus) was utilized to verify if the MiND-B could detect ALS plus patients. Finally, 20 ALS patients completed the MiND-B after a six-month period. Apathy, disinhibition and stereotypical behaviour were all found to be very common symptoms in ALS occurring in 75%, 66% and 58%, respectively, of cases. Notably, the MiND-B could identify ALS plus patients without standard cognitive assessments. In conclusion, the MiND-B tool can detect patients with ALS plus reliably, by means of questions to the informant. This test could enable ALS centres to evaluate non-motor symptoms and adapt management and decision-making approaches as necessary. *only available in the online version of the journal.

AB  - White matter (WM) tract alterations were assessed in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) relative to healthy controls and patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) to explore the relationship of WM tract damage with clinical disease severity, performance on cognitive tests, and apathy. 37 PSP patients, 41 PD patients, and 34 healthy controls underwent an MRI scan and clinical testing to evaluate physical disability, cognitive impairment, and apathy. In PSP, the contribution of WM tract damage to global disease severity and cognitive and behavioural disturbances was assessed using Random Forest analysis. Relative to controls, PSP patients showed diffusion tensor (DT) MRI abnormalities of the corpus callosum, superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), cingulum and uncinate fasciculus bilaterally, and right inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Corpus callosum and SCP DT MRI measures distinguished PSP from PD patients with high accuracy (area under the curve ranging from 0.89 to 0.72). In PSP, DT MRI metrics of the corpus callosum and superior cerebellar peduncles were the best predictors of global disease severity scale scores. DT MRI metrics of the corpus callosum, right superior longitudinal and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and left uncinate were the best predictors of executive dysfunction. In PSP, apathy severity was related to the damage to the corpus callosum, right superior longitudinal, and uncinate fasciculi. In conclusion, WM tract damage contributes to the motor, cognitive, and behavioural deficits in PSP. DT MRI offers markers for PSP diagnosis, assessment, and monitoring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) is often used to assess depressive symptoms among stroke patients, but more evidence is needed regarding its psychometric properties in this population. The purpose of this study was to assess the BDI-II׳s psychometric properties using a Rasch model application in a sample of patients 6 months after a first clinical stroke. METHODS: Data were collected prospectively from patient medical records and from questionnaires (with assistance if needed) as a part of a longitudinal study of poststroke fatigue. Data from the 6-month follow-up were used in this analysis. The sample consisted of 106 patients with first-ever stroke recruited from two Norwegian hospitals between 2007 and 2008. Depressive symptoms were measured with the BDI-II. Rasch analysis was used to assess the BDI-II׳s psychometric properties in this sample. RESULTS: Five BDI-II items did not demonstrate acceptable goodness-of-fit to the Rasch model: items 10 (crying), 16 (changes in sleep), 17 (irritability), 18 (changes in appetite), and 21 (loss of interest in sex). If these 5 items were removed, the resulting 16-item version not only had fewer items, it also had better internal scale validity, person-response validity, and person-separation reliability than the original 21-item version in this sample of stroke survivors. LIMITATIONS: The study did not include a clinical evaluation of depression. CONCLUSION: A 16-item version of the BDI-II, omitting items 10, 16, 17, 18 and 21, may be more appropriate than the original 21-item BDI-II for use as a unidimensional measure of depression in patients following first-ever stroke.

T1  - Abbreviated quality of life scales for schizophrenia: comparison and utility of two brief community functioning measures
LA  - eng
SN  - 1573-2509
Y1  - 2014/04/
ET  - 2014/03/11
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Heinrichs-Carpenter Quality of Life Scale (QLS) is the most extensively used real-world community functioning scale in schizophrenia research. However, the extensive time required to administer it and the inclusion of items that overlap conceptually with negative symptoms limit its use across studies. The present study examined the validity and utility of two abbreviated QLS measures against the full QLS excluding negative symptom items. METHOD: The sample included 1427 patients with schizophrenia who completed the baseline visit in the CATIE study. The validity of two abbreviated QLS measures (7-item and 4-item) were examined with the full QLS, excluding the intrapsychic foundations subscale, using correlation analysis. The utility of the abbreviated measures was explored by examining associations between the functioning scales and clinical variables and longitudinal change. RESULTS: Both abbreviated QLS measures were highly predictive of the full QLS (both r=0.91, p<0.001), with no difference in predictive value between the abridged measures. Functional status was significantly associated with symptoms and cognition. Importantly, the strength of these associations was similar between the abbreviated and full QLS. Finally, multiple regression models examining the explanatory power of amotivation/apathy in predicting functioning scores after other symptoms and neurocognition had been accounted for were essentially identical irrespective of the QLS instrument used as the dependent measure. Longitudinal change was also similar across the three scales. CONCLUSIONS: The 7-item abbreviated QLS is recommended as a brief measure of community functioning for individuals with schizophrenia, especially when assessment of functional outcome is not the focus.

T1  - Correlations of apathy and depression with postural instability in Parkinson disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1878-5883
Y1  - 2014/03/15
ET  - 2014/01/02
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postural instability (PI) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with depression and apathy based on UPDRS scores. We sought to examine the link using more objective PI measures. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, depression and apathy data were recorded for PD patients prospectively recruited from an outpatient university movement disorders clinic. PI was objectively evaluated using the standing center of pressure sway area. RESULTS: Thirty-seven PD patients participated in the study. Bivariate analysis revealed that PI was significantly correlated to both apathy (p=0.018) and depression (p=0.014). Hierarchical regression revealed that apathy significantly predicted PI but depression did not significantly add to the prediction. Also, depression did not significantly predict PI and the addition of apathy did not increase this prediction. CONCLUSION: Apathy and depression are both associated with objective measures of PI, and apathy appears a stronger predictor of PI than depression. Concomitant improvement in PI may be important to consider when measuring apathy or depression interventions in PD.

AB  - Reliable and valid measurement of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) is important for research and clinical practice. Here we provide an overview of the different instruments and discuss issues involved in the choice of the most appropriate instrument to measure BPSD in research. A list of BPSD instruments was generated. For each instrument Pubmed and SCOPUS were searched for articles that reported on their use or quality. Eighty-three instruments that are used to measure BPSD were identified. Instruments differ in length and detail, whether the interview is with participants, informants or by observation, the target sample and the time frames for use. Reliability and validity is generally good, but reported in few independent samples. When choosing a BPSD instrument for research the research question should be carefully scrutinised and the symptoms of interest, population, quality, detail, time frame and practical issues should be considered.

LA  - eng
SN  - 1708-8186
Y1  - 2014/03/
ET  - 2013/11/28
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the tactics people use when aural communication fails owing to environmental circumstances or impaired hearing. DESIGN: Persons with different degrees of self-reported hearing impairment completed an online questionnaire constructed from items taken from the literature on communication strategies but reworded to be understood by people with normal hearing. Tactics were examined for frequency of use in two severities of impairment and between genders. All the data were then factor analysed and factor scores related to variables of relevance to communication. STUDY SAMPLE: A large convenience sample (n = 188) with a range of self-assessed hearing impairment from normal to profound. RESULTS: Descriptive data revealed some differences in frequency of use in relation to severity and gender. Factor analysis yielded six clearly interpretable factors, the largest relating to disengagement (avoidance). Self-assessed impairment was chiefly associated with a speech reading tactic, negatively with environmental optimization strategies, and to a small extent with disengagement and conversation repair. CONCLUSIONS: Only the tactic of speech reading was closely associated with impaired hearing, with some evidence that females were more inclined to use it. Otherwise, all tactics were commonly employed, regardless of hearing status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the effect of methylphenidate (MPH) on attention in Alzheimer's disease (AD). MPH has shown to improve apathy in AD, and both apathy and attention have been related to dopaminergic function. The goal was to investigate MPH effects on attention in AD and assess the relationship between attention and apathy responses. METHODS: MPH (10 mg PO twice daily) or placebo was administered for six weeks in a randomized, double-blind trial in mild-to-moderate AD outpatients with apathy (Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Apathy ≥ 4). Attention was measured with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale--Digit Span (DS) subtest (DS forward, selective attention) and apathy with the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). A mixed effects linear regression estimated the difference in change from baseline between treatment groups, defined as δ (MPH (DS week 6-DS baseline)) - (placebo (DS week 6-DS baseline)). RESULTS: In 60 patients (37 females, age = 76 ± 8, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) = 20 ± 5, NPI Apathy = 7 ± 2), the change in DS forward (δ = 0.87 (95% CI: 0.06-1.68), p = 0.03) and DS total (δ = 1.01 (95% CI: 0.09-1.93), p = 0.03) favored MPH over placebo. Of 57 completers, 17 patients had improved apathy (≥3.3 points on the AES from baseline to end point) and 40 did not. There were no significant associations between AES and NPI Apathy with DS change scores in the MPH, placebo, AES responder, or non-responder groups. DS scores did not predict apathy response to MPH treatment. CONCLUSION: These results suggest MPH can improve attention and apathy in AD; however, the effects appear independent in this population.

T1  - Development of the PRE-HIT instrument: patient readiness to engage in health information technology
LA  - eng
SN  - 1471-2296
Y1  - 2014/01/28
AB  - BACKGROUND: Technology-based aids for lifestyle change are becoming more prevalent for chronic conditions. Important "digital divides" remain, as well as concerns about privacy, data security, and lack of motivation. Researchers need a way to characterize participants' readiness to use health technologies. To address this need, we created an instrument to measure patient readiness to engage with health technologies among adult patients with chronic conditions. METHODS: Initial focus groups to determine domains, followed by item development and refinement, and exploratory factor analysis to determine final items and factor structure. The development sample included 200 patients with chronic conditions from 6 family medicine clinics. From 98 potential items, 53 best candidate items were examined using exploratory factor analysis. Pearson's Correlation for Test/Retest reliability at 3 months. RESULTS: The final instrument had 28 items that sorted into 8 factors with associated Cronbach's alpha: 1) Health Information Need (0.84), 2) Computer/Internet Experience (0.87), 3) Computer Anxiety (0.82), 4) Preferred Mode of Interaction (0.73), 5) Relationship with Doctor (0.65), 6) Cell Phone Expertise (0.75), 7) Internet Privacy (0.71), and 8) No News is Good News (0.57). Test-retest reliability for the 8 subscales ranged from (0.60 to 0.85). CONCLUSION: The Patient Readiness to Engage in Health Internet Technology (PRE-HIT) instrument has good psychometric properties and will be an aid to researchers investigating technology-based health interventions. Future work will examine predictive validity.

T1  - Self-stigma in psychiatric patients--standardization of the ISMI scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 0172-780X
Y1  - 2014
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Self-stigma in psychiatric patients is an issue deserving both research and therapeutic attention. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of a Czech version of the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale assessing the levels of self-stigma in individuals with mental disorders. METHODS: It consists of 29 items classified into 5 subscales, namely alienation, stereotype endorsement, perceived discrimination, social withdrawal and stigma resistance. The study group comprised 369 patients with a mean age of 41.5±13.3 years, of whom 210 (56.6%) were females. RESULTS: The most frequent diagnosis was neurotic disorders (46.1%), followed by affective disorders (18.4%), substance use disorders (13.3%), psychotic disorders (10.8%), personality disorders (9.5%) and organic disorders (1.6%). Reliability of the scale was evaluated by internal consistency analysis (α=0.91), the split-half method (Spearman-Brown coefficient: 0.93) and test-retest at 3 weeks from the first measurement (N=17; r=0.90, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Exploratory factor analysis of the scale was performed, its validity was verified and norms were established that were based on T-scores and sten scores for the entire scale and individual subscales. The Czech translation of the ISMI has adequate psychometric properties.

T1  - Reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale
LA  - jpn
SN  - 0300-9173
Y1  - 2014
AB  - AIM: Clinicians need an objective scale to measure apathy in patients with dementia. However, different cutoff scores for the Apathy Evaluation Scale Informant version (AES-I), an international apathy scale, have been used in previous studies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cutoff score, reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the AES-I (AES-I-J). METHODS: We acquired the author's permission to translate the AES from English to Japanese. The subjects of this study included 50 patients with dementia living in institutions or the community. The mean (standard deviation; SD) age of the subjects was 82.7 (5.7) years, the mean (SD) educational level was 8.9 (2.7) years and the mean (SD) Mini-Mental State Examination score was 14.8 (8.1). We provided the caregivers with two apathy scales to assess each patient: the AES-I-J (re-test: four weeks later) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory in Nursing Home version apathy score. RESULTS: The mean (SD) score for the AES-I-J was 45.8 (16.2). For this test, Cronbach's α was 0.97, and the intraclass correlation coefficient of test-retest was 0.88 (95%CI: 0.72-0.95) (p<0.0001). In addition, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.90 (95%CI: 0.78-1.00) (p<0.0001) and the cut-off score was 45/46, with a sensitivity of 89.5% and specificity of 81.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the cutoff score for the AES-I-J is higher than that used in previous reports.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To date, no rating scales for detecting apathy in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have been validated in Spanish. For this reason, the aim of this study was to validate a Spanish version of Lille apathy rating scale (LARS) in a cohort of PD patients from Spain. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: 130 PD patients and 70 healthy controls were recruited to participate in the study. Apathy was measured using the Spanish version of LARS and the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI). Reliability (internal consistency, test-retest, and interrater reliability) and validity (construct, content, and criterion validity) were measured. RESULTS: Interrater reliability was 0.93. Cronbach's α for LARS was 0.81. The test-retest correlation coefficient was 0.97. The correlation between LARS and NPI scores was 0.61. The optimal cutoff point under the ROC curve was -14, whereas the value derived from healthy controls was -11. The prevalence of apathy in our population tested by LARS was 42%. CONCLUSIONS: The Spanish version of LARS is a reliable and useful tool for diagnosing apathy in PD patients. Total LARS score is influenced by the presence of depression and cognitive impairment. However, both disorders are independent identities with respect to apathy. The satisfactory reliability and validity of the scale make it an appropriate instrument for screening and diagnosing apathy in clinical practice or for research purposes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathetic and subsyndromal depressive conditions are common in the oldest old. This study examined whether nondysphoric depression (NDD), a clinical condition characterized by ideational and vegetative but no emotional symptoms of depression, belongs to the apathetic presentations of late-life depression. Rates of NDD, dysphoric depression (DD), apathy, and social functional impairment were examined in a sample of nondemented very old (mean age 87.5 years, SD = 7.7) nursing home residents. It was hypothesized that individuals with NDD show greater apathy and greater social functional impairment relative to DD and nondepressed individuals. METHODS: Social functioning was measured using the Social-Adaptive Functioning Evaluation (SAFE) and apathy was measured using the global apathy rating on the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). RESULTS: The rates of DD (50.0%) and NDD (27.4%) were quite high. Participants with DD reported greater apathy than those with NDD (and nondepressed individuals). NDD and DD subjects showed greater social functional impairment relative to the comparison group. There was no difference in social functioning between DD and NDD individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The present data are inconsistent with the view that NDD among the oldest old is an apathetic form of depression. NDD involves social functional impairment. Limitations include rather selected population of nursing home residents that may have included individuals with early dementia, lack of data on prior depressive episodes, and apathy assessment not validated on the specific population.

T1  - A case of atypical progressive supranuclear palsy

AB  - BACKGROUND: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative extrapyramidal syndrome. Studies have demonstrated that PSP can present clinically as an atypical dementing syndrome dominated by a progressive apraxia of speech (AOS) and aphasia. AIM: We aimed to investigate the clinical presentation of PSP, using a comprehensive multidimensional evaluation, and the disease response to various pharmacological treatments. METHODS: A 72-year-old right-handed male, with 17 years education, who first presented with aphasia, AOS, depression, apathy, and postural instability at 69 years; a complete neuropsychological evaluation, tapping the different cognitive domains, was performed. RESULTS: Testing revealed a moderate global cognitive deficit (Mini-Mental State Examination test score =20), low memory test scores (story recall, Rey's 15-word Immediate and Delayed Recall), and poor phonemic and semantic fluency. The patient's language was characterized by AOS, with slow speech rate, prolonged intervals between syllables and words, decreased articulatory accuracy, sound distortions, and anomia. Behavioral changes, such as depression, anxiety, apathy, and irritability, were reported. The neurological examination revealed supranuclear vertical gaze palsy, poor face miming, and a mild balance deficit. Magnetic resonance imaging showed only widespread cortical atrophy. Single photon emission computed tomography demonstrated left > right frontotemporal cortical abnormalities. After 6 months, a further neuropsychological assessment showed a progression in cognitive deficits, with additional attention deficits. The patient reported frequent falls, but the neurological deficits remained unchanged. Neuroimaging tests showed the same brain involvement. CONCLUSION: Our case highlights the heterogeneity of the clinical features in this syndrome, demonstrating that atypical PSP can present as AOS and aphasia, without the classical features or involvement of the subcortical gray and brainstem region, commonly affected in typical PSP.

T1  - Measuring life space in older adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease using mobile phone GPS
LA  - eng
SN  - 1423-0003
Y1  - 2014
ET  - 2013/12/12
AB  - BACKGROUND: As an indicator of physical and cognitive functioning in community-dwelling older adults, there is increasing interest in measuring life space, defined as the geographical area a person covers in daily life. Typically measured through questionnaires, life space can be challenging to assess in amnestic dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). While global positioning system (GPS) technology has been suggested as a potential solution, there remains a lack of data validating GPS-based methods to measure life space in cognitively impaired populations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the construct validity of a GPS system to provide quantitative measurements of global movement for individuals with mild-to-moderate AD. METHODS: Nineteen community-dwelling older adults with mild-to-moderate AD (Mini-Mental State Examination score 14-28, age 70.7 ± 2.2 years) and 33 controls (CTL; age 74.0 ± 1.2 years) wore a GPS-enabled mobile phone during the day for 3 days. Measures of geographical territory (area, perimeter, mean distance from home, and time away from home) were calculated from the GPS log. Following a log-transformation to produce symmetrical distributions, group differences were tested using two-sample t tests. Construct validity of the GPS measures was tested by examining the correlation between the GPS measures and indicators of physical function [steps/day, gait velocity, and Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD)] and affective state (Apathy Evaluation Scale and Geriatric Depression Scale). Multivariate regression was performed to evaluate the relative strength of significantly correlated factors. RESULTS: GPS-derived area (p < 0.01), perimeter (p < 0.01), and mean distance from home (p < 0.05) were smaller in the AD group compared to CTL. The correlation analysis found significant associations of the GPS measures area and perimeter with all measures of physical function (steps/day, DAD, and gait velocity; p < 0.01), symptoms of apathy (p < 0.01), and depression (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis indicated that gait velocity and dependence were the strongest variables associated with GPS measures. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that GPS-derived area and perimeter: (1) distinguished mild-to-moderate AD patients from CTL and (2) were strongly correlated with physical function and affective state. These findings confirm the ability of GPS technology to assess life space behaviour and may be particularly valuable to continuously monitor functional decline associated with neurodegenerative disease, such as AD.

T1  - The relationship between change in apathy and changes in cognition and functional outcomes in currently non-depressed SSRI-treated patients with major depressive disorder
LA  - eng

AB  - AIMS: Apathy in the context of treated major depressive disorder (MDD) is a frequently observed phenomenon in clinical practice. This study aimed to assess the validity of the Rothschild Scale for Antidepressant Tachyphylaxis® (RSAT) and the Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ) for measuring apathy, and to assess the relationship between apathy and possible contributing factors, in patients with MDD and residual apathy in the absence of depressed mood. METHODS: The underlying structure and validity of the RSAT and CPFQ were assessed via factor analysis and correlation with the Apathy Evaluation Scale-Clinician rated version (AES-C) in 483 patients who had previously responded to treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The relationship between apathy and contributing variables was investigated via structural equation modeling. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and the RSAT, CPFQ, and AES-C. RESULTS: The RSAT and CPFQ were validated with the AES-C with respect to energy and motivation. The latent variable "Energy and Interest", based on the energy, motivation, and interest items (RSAT and CPFQ), was a major contributing factor to apathy. Improvements in function (SDS) were significantly correlated with, and predicted by, improvements in apathy and cognitive and physical functioning (assessed by the RSAT, CPFQ, and AES-C). CONCLUSIONS: These analyses provide further information on apathy and its assessment in the context of treated MDD. A better understanding of apathy will aid further investigation of this phenomenon and, ultimately, determination of the most appropriate approach for its clinical management.

T1  - Development and validation of the Specific Loss of Interest and Pleasure Scale (SLIPS)
LA  - eng
SN  - 1573-2517
Y1  - 2014/01/
ET  - 2013/09/18
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anhedonia, or loss of pleasure and/or interest in people or things, is a key component of many forms of psychopathology. Extant anhedonia measures only assess current state or longstanding trait anhedonia, which risks discounting recent changes. Thus, we created the Specific Loss of Interest and Pleasure Scale (SLIPS), to assess recent changes in anhedonia. METHODS: Four studies assessed the reliability and validity of the SLIPS through factor and internal consistency analyses, convergent and divergent validity analyses, and incremental validity analyses in individuals reporting non-clinical and clinical levels of psychopathology. RESULTS: The SLIPS was internally consistent, converged with existing state measures of anhedonia and depression, and diverged from general measures of affect and trait anticipatory and consummatory pleasure. Furthermore, the SLIPS predicted recent changes in anhedonia independent of existing measures. Moreover, in respondents reporting moderate or severe symptoms of depression, only the SLIPS was associated with recent changes in anhedonia. LIMITATIONS: Prospective limitations included a resulting one factor solution and the potential that the method of scaling influenced results. However, these limitations were offset by empirical verification and the unique strength of the scaling of the SLIPS. CONCLUSIONS: The SLIPS is the first validated measure that allows for the assessment of recent changes in anhedonia in non-clinical and clinical samples. Results suggest that the SLIPS offers unique clinical utility by discriminating changes in anhedonia within at-risk and clinically depressed groups.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Individuals suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) often have impaired awareness or a lack of insight into their cognitive deficits and functional abilities, especially in the later stages of the disease. Previous research has documented a relationship between depression and insight in AD, such that greater awareness of one's disease has been associated with a higher degree of depression. However, little is known about the relationship between insight, cognitive decline, and other psychiatric or behavioral problems associated with AD. METHODS: This study included 107 outpatients who met criteria for probable AD. Instruments included the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale, the Apathy Evaluation Scale, and the mini mental state exam. A series of hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between insight and depressed mood, anxiety, psychosis, apathy, agitation, and behavioral retardation in AD patients after controlling for cognitive skills. RESULTS: Insight was found to significantly predict depressed mood, anxiety, and apathy even after controlling for global cognition. Greater insight was found to be associated with depressed mood and anxiety. However, impaired insight was associated with higher levels of apathy. CONCLUSION: Insight may be differentially related to mood symptoms and apathy within AD, such that patients with intact insight are more depressed, whereas patients with impaired insight are more apathetic. This suggests that assessment of insight in AD may complement the clinical evaluation of depression and apathy in AD and help guide the most appropriate interventions. Published 2013.

T1  - Assessing apathy in everyday clinical practice with the short-form Lille Apathy Rating Scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 1531-8257
Y1  - 2013/12/
ET  - 2013/07/08
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is an invalidating behavioral disorder that must always be screened for and assessed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) has been validated in several different contexts, but the lengthy administration time means that it is mostly recommended for research use. The aim of the present study was to validate a short form of the LARS for use in everyday practice. METHODS: In total, 416 patients with PD and 56 healthy controls participated in the study. Apathy, depression, motor symptoms, and overall cognitive efficiency were assessed. The most discriminant items of the LARS for apathy detection were selected using multiple indicators. RESULTS: A subset of 12 items (constituting the short-form LARS) showed the best convergence. Concurrent and criterion-related validity, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and inter-rater reliability were very good. CONCLUSIONS: The short-form LARS is a reliable, practical, patient interview-based instrument for assessing apathy in everyday clinical practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The overlap between symptoms of PTSD and MDD is substantial. PTSD symptoms arise after a traumatic experience and the trauma is present in all of the diagnostic clusters. In individuals who have experienced a trauma a long time before, it is difficult to establish the exact moment of onset of their symptoms in relation to the trauma suffered. We proposed to raise awareness among operators who may encounter this problem, with the aim of providing them with valuable help in order to achieve a correct differential diagnosis. METHODS: A sample of subjects suffering from PTSD without comorbidity was assessed to confirm the diagnosis and the severity of post-traumatic symptoms. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare any modifications in the parameters analyzed through the Davidson Trauma Scale with the presence and severity of depressive symptoms as evaluated by the Hamilton-D scale. RESULTS: Half of the PSTD patients recruited showed values of HAM-D > 18, although an active Major Depressive Episode was clinically excluded. Symptom of "numbing", despite being different from the apathy experienced in depression, is identified as a depressive symptom by the HAM-D. CONCLUSIONS: Giving prevalence to depressive symptoms may be misleading for diagnosis and may ultimately result in inappropriate treatment.

T1  - Apathy is more severe in vascular than amnestic mild cognitive impairment in a community: the Kurihara Project
LA  - eng
SN  - 1440-1819
Y1  - 2013/11/
ET  - 2013/10/22
AB  - AIM:  The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of apathy, and to compare vascular mild cognitive impairment (vMCI), amnestic MCI (amMCI), and other type using Clinical Assessment for Spontaneity (CAS). METHODS:  Agreement to take part in the study was obtained from 590 community dwellers, aged ≥75 years living in Kurihara, Japan. Of the 590 subjects, 221 had a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0 (normal); 295 had CDR 0.5 (mild cognitive impairment; MCI); and 74 had CDR 1+ (dementia). The CDR 0.5 subjects were divided into three groups: 55 with vMCI (Erkinjuntti et al. criteria), 91 with amMCI and 149 with other type. To evaluate the various aspects of apathy, we used the three CAS subscales: clinical interview (CAS1), self-evaluation (CAS2), and caregiver assessment (CAS3). Three analyses were then performed to determine: (i) the validity of CAS; (ii) the prevalence rate of apathy in CDR 0 versus CDR 0.5 versus CDR 1+; and (iii) the prevalence rate of apathy in normal versus vMCI versus amMCI versus other type. RESULTS:  CAS was validated with the Apathy Evaluation Scale. There were significant differences among the three CDR groups in CAS1, CAS2 and CAS3 (P < 0.001). The prevalence rate of apathy in each CAS in the CDR 1+ group was higher than the CDR 0.5 group, which was higher than the CDR 0 group. There was a significant difference in CAS3 score between the four groups (the normal and the three subgroups; P < 0.001). Apathy in vMCI was more severe than in the other three groups (P < 0.05) on CAS3 score. CONCLUSIONS:  vMCI subjects have more severe apathy compared with amMCI subjects on caregiver assessment.

T1  - Trajectories of individual symptoms in remitters versus non-remitters with depression
LA  - eng
SN  - 1573-2517
Y1  - 2013/11/
ET  - 2013/07/22
AB  - BACKGROUND: It remains unclear regarding the contribution of each individual symptom in predicting the outcome in major depressive disorder (MDD). The objective of this analysis was to evaluate trajectories of individual symptoms over time to identify which specific depressive item(s) could predict subsequent clinical response. METHODS: The data of 2874 outpatients with nonpsychotic MDD who received citalopram for up to 14 weeks in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial were analyzed. Average trajectories of individual symptoms over time were estimated for remitters and non-remitters. Moreover, specific symptoms whose improvement at week 2 predicted remission were identified, using binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Trajectories were significantly different between remitters and non-remitters in all depressive symptoms. All depressive symptoms in the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Self-Report (QIDS-SR16) in the two groups, except for hypersomnia and weight change in non-remitters, substantially improved within 2 weeks and gradually continued to improve thereafter throughout the 14 weeks. Early improvements in the following five symptoms, in order of magnitude, in the QIDS-SR16 were significantly associated with remission: sad mood, negative self-view, feeling slowed down, low energy, and restlessness (P<0.001, P<0.001, P=0.001, P=0.004, P=0.021). LIMITATIONS: The participants were limited to the nonpsychotic MDD outpatients who received citalopram. Further, symptomatology was not evaluated at the very beginning of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: While the data pertain to citalopram and replication is necessary for other antidepressants, early improvements in certain core depressive symptoms may serve as a predictor of subsequent remission.

METHODS: Height, weight, 3-day diet records, and HNSC(©) were obtained at baseline, posttreatment, and 2.5 month follow-up for 52 treatment-naive head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Relationships among energy intake, weight loss, age, sex, treatment, tumor stage, and NIS were evaluated using general estimating equation (GEE) modeling. Cumulative hazard (CH) analysis was used to determine the time and risk of weight loss. RESULTS: From baseline to posttreatment, 71 % of patients had 5 % body weight loss. Despite energy intakes returning to baseline levels at follow-up, 88 % of patients continued to lose weight. At posttreatment, 100 % of patients reported 2 or more NIS (range 2-12); these symptoms were still present at follow-up in 83 % of the patients. Univariate GEE analysis demonstrated that most NIS predicted energy intake and weight loss, while multivariate GEE analysis showed that depression, dysphagia, and sore mouth predicted energy intake, and dysphagia and sore mouth predicted weight loss. CH analysis showed that NIS accelerated the time and probability of weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: The HNSC(©) is a valid tool for assessing NIS in HNC. Identification of NIS may aid in the management of symptoms associated with reduced energy intake and weight loss and thus decrease the malnutrition risk in HNC patients.

T1  - Nonmotor symptoms in nursing home residents with Parkinson's disease: prevalence and effect on quality of life
LA  - eng
SN  - 1532-5415
Y1  - 2013/10/
ET  - 2013/10/01
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of nonmotor symptoms (NMS) in nursing home (NH) residents with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to establish the association with quality of life. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Nursing homes in the southeast of the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents with PD and a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 18 or greater (N = 73; mean age 78.7, disease duration 10 years, mainly Hoehn and Yahr Stages 4 (38%) and 5 (49%)) underwent detailed examination to determine the prevalence of NMS. MEASUREMENTS: Validated instruments for PD-related NMS were used to examine the NH residents with PD. The overall burden of NMS, and autonomic problems in particular, were measured using the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS). Depression, neuropsychiatric symptoms, sleep problems, cognitive dysfunction, and motor impairments were focused on in further detail using established clinimetric tests. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between these symptoms and quality of life, which was measured using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8). RESULTS: The NMSS revealed a mean of nearly 13 different NMS per resident. Autonomic problems (constipation, urinary urgency) were particularly prevalent (48-75% of residents). Depressive symptoms were present in 45%. The most prevalent neuropsychiatric symptoms other than depression were irritability and apathy. The most common sleep problems were overall poor nighttime sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and nocturia. Cognitive problems were highly prevalent, and 77% of the residents met the criteria for PD-related dementia. High scores were also obtained for motor impairments. Mean PDQ-8 score was high, indicating poor quality of life. Poor quality of life was most strongly associated with the prevalence and severity of overall NMS burden (coefficient of determination = 0.45). CONCLUSION: Nonmotor symptoms were highly prevalent in NH residents with PD. Quality of life was poor, largely because of NMS. Because many NMS are potentially treatable, diagnosis and treatment of these severely affected individuals deserve more attention.

T1  - Salience network resting-state activity: prediction of frontotemporal dementia progression
LA  - eng
SN  - 2168-6157
Y1  - 2013/10/
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Noninvasive measures of activity within intrinsic brain networks may be clinically relevant, providing a marker of neurodegenerative disease and predicting clinical behaviors. OBJECTIVE: To correlate baseline resting-state measures within the salience network and changes in behavior among patients with frontotemporal dementia. DESIGN: Baseline resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data and longitudinal clinical measures were obtained from prospectively accrued patients during 8 weeks. SETTING: Tertiary academic care center specializing in the assessment and management of patients with neurodegenerative disease. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen patients with clinically diagnosed frontotemporal dementia (5 behavioral variant and 10 semantic dementia). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Baseline resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data measured within regions of interest were regressed on serial behavioral measures from prospectively accrued patients with frontotemporal dementia to determine the ability of baseline resting-state activity to account for changes in behavior. RESULTS: Low-frequency fluctuations in the left insula significantly predicted changes in Frontal Behavioral Inventory scores (standard β = 0.51, P = .049), accounting for 28% of the change variance. The trend was driven by changes in measures of apathy independent of dementia severity. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Baseline measures of salience network connectivity involving the left insula may predict behavioral changes in patients with frontotemporal dementia.

T1  - Confirmatory factor analysis of the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe)
LA  - eng
SN  - 1552-3489
Y1  - 2013/10/
ET  - 2013/06/25
AB  - The Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) is a 46-item questionnaire that measures behaviors associated with frontal subcortical deficits (apathy, disinhibition, and executive dysfunction) in adult neurologic populations. Based on findings from a previous exploratory factor analysis on the scale, the current study used confirmatory factor analysis to explore and potentially improve on the measurement model fit of current FrSBe scores. Model fit indices and reliabilities (measured using internal consistency reliability) were compared in the original and in several alternative models. The original scale demonstrated a generally good fitting model, although the best fitting model (referred to as the reduced model) removed eight items from the original measure and modestly improved model fit over the original FrSBe. Strong reliability was found in both versions. Results from the current study provide a critical first step in a potential FrSBe scale revision.

T1  - To what extent do single symptoms from a depression rating scale predict risk of long-term sickness absence among employees who are free of clinical depression?
LA  - eng
SN  - 1432-1246
Y1  - 2013/10/
ET  - 2012/08/23
AB  - PURPOSE: Depression rating scales have predicted long-term sickness absence (LTSA) in previous studies. With this study, we investigated to what extent single symptoms from a depression rating scale predicted LTSA among employees who were free of clinical depression. METHODS: We studied 6,670 female employees in the Danish eldercare sector. Frequency of 12 depressive symptoms over the last 2 weeks was assessed with the Major Depression Inventory. A symptom was considered as elevated if it was present at least "slightly more than half of the time." Data were linked to a national register on LTSA (≥3 weeks). We calculated hazard ratios (HR) from Cox's proportional hazard models to analyze whether a symptom predicted time to onset of LTSA during a 1-year follow-up. Analyses were adjusted for age, family status, health behaviors, occupational group, and previous LTSA. RESULTS: Of the 12 symptoms, three predicted LTSA after adjustment for covariates: "felt low in spirits and sad" (HR = 1.41, 95 % CI = 1.05-1.89), "felt lacking in energy and strength" (HR = 1.33, 95 % CI = 1.08-1.64), and "had trouble sleeping at night" (HR = 1.38, 95 % CI = 1.09-1.74). CONCLUSION: Among female eldercare workers free of clinical depression, feelings of low spirits and sadness, feelings of lack of energy and strength, and sleep disturbances predict risk of LTSA. Interventions that decrease the prevalence of these symptoms might contribute to a reduction in LTSA in this population.

AB  - The Behavioural Rating Scale for Geriatric Inpatients (GIP) consists of fourteen, Rasch modelled subscales, each measuring different aspects of behavioural, cognitive and affective disturbances in elderly patients. Four additional measures are derived from the GIP: care dependency, apathy, cognition and affect. The objective of the study was to determine the reproducibility of the 18 measures. A convenience sample of 56 patients in psychogeriatric day care was assessed twice by the same observer (a professional caregiver). The median time interval between rating occasions was 45 days (interquartile range 34-58 days). Reproducibility was determined by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC agreement) for test-retest reliability. The minimal detectable difference (MDD) was calculated based on the standard error of measurement (SEM agreement). Test-retest reliability expressed by the ICCs varied from 0.57 (incoherent behaviour) to 0.93 (anxious behaviour). Standard errors of measurement varied from 0.28 (anxious behaviour) to 1.63 (care dependency). The results show how the GIP can be applied when interpreting individual change in psychogeriatric day care participants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with dementia may be unable to describe their symptoms, and caregivers frequently suffer emotional burden that can interfere with judgment of the patient's behavior. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician rating scale (NPI-C) was therefore developed as a comprehensive and versatile instrument to assess and accurately measure neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in dementia, thereby using information from caregiver and patient interviews, and any other relevant available data. The present study is a follow-up to the original, cross-national NPI-C validation, evaluating the reliability and concurrent validity of the NPI-C in quantifying psychopathological symptoms in dementia in a large Brazilian cohort. METHODS: Two blinded raters evaluated 312 participants (156 patient-knowledgeable informant dyads) using the NPI-C for a total of 624 observations in five Brazilian centers. Inter-rater reliability was determined through intraclass correlation coefficients for the NPI-C domains and the traditional NPI. Convergent validity included correlations of specific domains of the NPI-C with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Index (CMAI), the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), and the Apathy Inventory (AI). RESULTS: Inter-rater reliability was strong for all NPI-C domains. There were high correlations between NPI-C/delusions and BPRS, NPI-C/apathy-indifference with the AI, NPI-C/depression-dysphoria with the CSDD, NPI-C/agitation with the CMAI, and NPI-C/aggression with the CMAI. There was moderate correlation between the NPI-C/aberrant vocalizations and CMAI and the NPI-C/hallucinations with the BPRS. CONCLUSION: The NPI-C is a comprehensive tool that provides accurate measurement of NPS in dementia with high concurrent validity and inter-rater reliability in the Brazilian setting. In addition to universal assessment, the NPI-C can be completed by individual domains.

ET  - 2013/01/07
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a frequent neuropsychiatric condition in neurodegenerative disorders, depression, and often in mild cognitive impairment. The Apathy Inventory (AI) is a reliable instrument for improving the accuracy of the apathy diagnosis. The aim was to establish the validity of the Apathy Inventory for the Brazilian community. METHODS: We established the concurrent validity, internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, and the sensitivity and specificity of AI for the Brazilian community in a cohort of 175 individuals with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy controls. The three dimensions of the AI (emotional blunting, lack of initiative, and lack of interest) were compared with the Apathy domain of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician rating scale (NPI-C) in an independent scheme. RESULTS: The analyses demonstrated high correlation coefficients in AI's individual dimensions and in AI-total score (F = 0.965). Concerning the NPI-C/Apathy domain, intra-class correlation coefficients were also high (F = 0.977). Concurrent validity was high according to both raters on AI dimensions × NPI-C/Apathy domain and regarding total score (rater 1: rho = 0.956 vs. rater 2: rho = 0.970). The internal consistency of the AI was also high concerning the AI's individual dimensions and total score (rater 1: 0.945 vs. rater 2: 0.958). CONCLUSION: We observed high internal consistency, high concurrent validity, and inter-rater reliability of the Apathy Inventory. In addition, we found that its sensitivity and specificity were high. We suggest that the Brazilian version of the Apathy Inventory would be an appropriate instrument to identify the apathy syndrome in Brazilian patients.

T1  - Validation of an abbreviated quality of life scale for schizophrenia
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-7862
Y1  - 2013/09/
ET  - 2012/12/09
AB  - The field of therapeutics in schizophrenia is redefining optimal outcome, moving beyond clinical remission to a more comprehensive model that also includes functional recovery. The Quality of Life Scale (QLS) has been adopted by many large clinical trials, including CATIE and CUtLASS, as a measure of functioning. The QLS is a 21-item semi-structured interview that takes approximately 45min to administer. Although the QLS is considered comprehensive, its length limits its applicability across studies. To circumvent this issue, short scales of the QLS have been created that estimate total scores with high accuracy. However, these abbreviated measures have not been adequately cross-validated in a large enough sample to allow for subsample estimations nor has its predictive ability been compared to the full scale. Here, we used data from the CATIE trial (n=1460) to demonstrate the validity and utility of an abbreviated 7-item QLS. The shortened QLS was robust in estimating total scores (r=0.953, p<0.001) across subsamples and demonstrated predictive ability similar to the full QLS in multiple regression models. The abridged QLS is recommended as a surrogate measure of psychosocial functioning, especially in cases where functioning is not the primary outcome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In a recent crossover trial, methylphenidate treatment decreased apathy in Alzheimer's disease. We further assessed this finding in the Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial (ADMET). METHOD: Six-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial enrolling Alzheimer's disease participants (NINCDS-ADRDA criteria) with apathy assigned to methylphenidate 20 mg daily or placebo, conducted from June 2010 to December 2011. Primary outcomes were change in Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) score and modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGI-C). Secondary outcomes included change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) apathy score, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, and safety. RESULTS: 60 participants were randomly assigned (29 methylphenidate, 31 placebo). At baseline, mean (SD) age = 76 (8) years, MMSE score = 20 (5), AES score = 51 (12), NPI total score = 16 (8), and 62% of the participants (n = 37) were female. After 6 weeks' treatment, mean (SD) change in AES score was -1.9 (1.5) for methylphenidate and 0.6 (1.4) for placebo (P = .23). Odds ratio for improvement in ADCS-CGI-C was 3.7 (95% CI, 1.3 to 10.8) (P = .02), with 21% of methylphenidate versus 3% of placebo rated as moderately or markedly improved. NPI apathy score improvement was 1.8 points (95% CI, 0.3 to 3.4) greater on methylphenidate than on placebo (P = .02). MMSE trended toward improvement on methylphenidate (P = .06). There were trends toward greater anxiety and weight loss > 2% in the methylphenidate-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Methylphenidate treatment of apathy in Alzheimer's disease was associated with significant improvement in 2 of 3 efficacy outcomes and a trend toward improved global cognition with minimal adverse events, supporting the safety and efficacy of methylphenidate treatment for apathy in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to develop an oral assessment tool for evaluating the appetite of patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy, who had dysgeusia, xerostomia, and oral mucositis, as well as to verify its validity and reliability. METHODS AND SAMPLE: A draft oral assessment tool, which included a 5-point scale and 19 items, was prepared based on an interview survey of 30 patients. The resultant questionnaire survey was provided to 209 subjects. RESULTS: On the basis of factor analysis of construct validity, 3 factors (dysgeusia and loss of favors), (salivation abnormality and loss of moisture in the oral cavity), and (pain in the oral cavity and lack of motivation) comprising 14 items were adopted for the final survey. During a review of criteria validity, a correlation was found between the scores of the three factors and overall oral assessment tool, and the scores of taste sensitivity, xerostomia, oral mucositis, and appetite with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.41-0.89 (p < 0.01). With regard to reliability, stability was determined as 0.87 (p < 0.01) according to test-retest study results. Internal consistency was confirmed by a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.83 (p < 0.01) and an interclass correlation coefficient of 0.80 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the validity and reliability of the oral assessment tool developed, it has been found to be practical for use in the assessment of appetite of patients with head and neck cancer.

T1  - Assessment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia: toward improving accuracy
LA  - eng
SN  - 1980-5764
Y1  - 2013///Jul-Sep
AB  - The issue of this article concerned the discussion about tools frequently used tools for assessing neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients with dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. The aims were to discuss the main tools for evaluating behavioral disturbances, and particularly the accuracy of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Clinician Rating Scale (NPI-C). The clinical approach to and diagnosis of neuropsychiatric syndromes in dementia require suitable accuracy. Advances in the recognition and early accurate diagnosis of psychopathological symptoms help guide appropriate pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. In addition, recommended standardized and validated measurements contribute to both scientific research and clinical practice. Emotional distress, caregiver burden, and cognitive impairment often experienced by elderly caregivers, may affect the quality of caregiver reports. The clinician rating approach helps attenuate these misinterpretations. In this scenario, the NPI-C is a promising and versatile tool for assessing neuropsychiatric syndromes in dementia, offering good accuracy and high reliability, mainly based on the diagnostic impression of the clinician. This tool can provide both strategies: a comprehensive assessment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia or the investigation of specific psychopathological syndromes such as agitation, depression, anxiety, apathy, sleep disorders, and aberrant motor disorders, among others.

T1  - Predictors of phenotypic progression and disease onset in premanifest and early-stage Huntington's disease in the TRACK-HD study: analysis of 36-month observational data

AB  - BACKGROUND: TRACK-HD is a multinational prospective observational study of Huntington's disease (HD) that examines clinical and biological findings of disease progression in individuals with premanifest HD (preHD) and early-stage HD. We aimed to describe phenotypic changes in these participants over 36 months and identify baseline predictors of progression. METHODS: Individuals without HD but carrying the mutant huntingtin gene (classed as preHD-A if ≥10·8 years and preHD-B if <10·8 years from predicted onset), participants with early HD (classed as HD1 if they had a total functional capacity score of 11-13 and HD2 if they had a score of 7-10), and healthy control individuals were assessed at four study sites in the Netherlands, the UK, France, and Canada. We measured 36-month change for 3T MRI, clinical, cognitive, quantitative motor, and neuropsychiatric assessments and examined their prognostic value. We also assessed the relation between disease progression and the combined effect of CAG repeat length and age. All participants were analysed according to their baseline subgroups. Longitudinal results were analysed using a combination of repeated-measure weighted least squares models and, when examining risk of new diagnosis, survival analysis. FINDINGS: At baseline, 366 participants were enrolled between Jan 17, and Aug 26, 2008, and of these 298 completed 36-month follow-up: 97 controls, 58 participants with preHD-A, 46 with preHD-B, 66 with HD1, and 31 with HD2. In the preHD-B group, several quantitative motor and cognitive tasks showed significantly increased rates of decline at 36 months, compared with controls, whereas few had at 24 months. Of the cognitive measures, the symbol digit modality test was especially sensitive (adjusted mean loss 4·11 points [95% CI 1·49-6·73] greater than controls; p=0·003). Among psychiatric indicators, apathy ratings specifically showed significant increases (0·34 points [95% CI 0·02-0·66] greater than controls; p=0·038). There was little evidence of reliable change in non-imaging measures in the preHD-A group, with the exception of the speeded tapping inter-tap interval (0·01 s [95% CI 0·01-0·02] longer than controls; p=0·0001). Several baseline imaging, quantitative motor, and cognitive measures had prognostic value, independent of age and CAG repeat length, for predicting subsequent clinical diagnosis in preHD. Of these, grey-matter volume and inter-tap interval were particularly sensitive (p=0·013 and 0·002, respectively). Longitudinal change in these two measures was also greater in participants with preHD who received a diagnosis of HD during the study compared with those who did not, after controlling for CAG repeat length and age-related risk (p=0·006 and 0·0003, respectively). In early HD, imaging, quantitative motor, and cognitive measures were predictive of decline in total functional capacity and tracked longitudinal change; also, neuropsychiatric changes consistent with frontostriatal pathological abnormalities were associated with this loss of functional capacity (problem behaviours assessment composite behaviour score p<0·0001). Age and CAG repeat length explained variance in longitudinal change of multimodal measures, with the effect more prominent in preHD. INTERPRETATION: We have shown changes in several outcome measures in individuals with preHD over 36 months. These findings further our understanding of HD progression and have implications for clinical trial design. FUNDING: CHDI Foundation.

T1  - Decision-making and apathy in early stage of Alzheimer's disease and in mild cognitive impairment

AB  - Decision-making and apathy have common neuropsychological processes and neuroanatomical substrates. However, their links in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: in order to evaluate these links, we compared 3 groups of 20 control subjects to 20 patients with MCI and 20 patients with mild AD. All participants completed the mini mental state examination (MMSE), the Lille apathy rating scale (LARS, a multidimensional scale of apathy), the game of dice task (GDT, assessing decision under risk) and the Iowa gambling task (IGT, assessing decision under ambiguity). RESULTS: 60% of patients in both clinical groups were apathetic versus 5% of control subjects. In both clinical groups the IGT and GDT net scores were comparable (respectively: p = 0.76 and p = 0.84), while the control group had higher scores than MCI and AD's groups (respectively, GDT p < 0.02 and p < 0.05; IGT: p < 0.05 and p < 0.05). Cognitive impairment increased the risk of disadvantageous choices in decision under risk (× 6), and under ambiguity (× 3.5). No global contribution of apathy was found for decision-making performances (all PS > 0.05), but on the LARS, the "intellectual curiosity" (cognitive dimension) was a predictor for the performances on GDT's (OR = 1.73, p = 0.05), while the "action initiation" (behavioral dimension) was a predictor of those on IGT (OR = 1.57, p = 0.05). DISCUSSION: these results highlight the behavioral and the cognitive sensitivity of the IGT and the GDT, and are analyzed according to Levy and Dubois's model of apathy, and to the three steps of the decision-making process of Gleichgerrcht et al. (2010). However, more researches are necessary to explain the causality links between action initiation and decision under ambiguity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to assess the role of demotivation and various affective factors in apathy in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) without dementia and depression. SUBJECTS: 20 patients and 20 control subjects matched with age, education level, and genre. METHODS: apathy was assessed by the Apathy evaluation scale (AES) and by a specific scale including a quantitative evaluation of 32 intentional activities and a qualitative assessment of the causes of attribution of restricted activities by a semi-structured interview (GDAS). Four causal attributions were distinguished: E = related to external factors, M = disease symptoms related, C = affective disturbances with preservation of motivation, and D = demotivation. The results were compared to a battery of tests including cognitive evaluation (mini-mental state and Mattis dementia rating scale for global evaluation, selecting reminding test for memory; Stroop test for inhibition, and six element test for planification); affective evaluation (Montgomery & Asberg and Hamilton depression rating scales for depression, emotional disturbances by the Abrams and Taylor scale, the Depression mood scale, and the International picture system), premorbid personality (NEOPI-R), and defensive psychological mechanisms (DSQ-40); functional assessment by a combined scale including the Self-maintenance physical scale and the Instrumental activities of daily living (Lawton) and the Social activities scale (Katz & Lyerly), the Disability assessment scale, and the UPDRS. RESULTS: apathy was found in 25% of the patients according to the AES, but only in 15% according to the GDAS. Scores on cognitive and affective evaluation were higher in patients than in controls but only emotional blunting was correlated to apathy. Some results coud be interpreted in favor of a premorbid personality disorder in patients with PD, but were not correlated to apathy. Causal attribution was M in 38% of cases of reduced activities, D in 30%, E in 22%, and C in 10%. CONCLUSION: emotional blunting was the main correlate of apathy in PD patients without dementia and depression. Demotivation was the causal mechanism in only 30% of the patients with apathy.

T1  - Fatigue after myocardial infarction - a two-year follow-up study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1365-2702
Y1  - 2013/06/
ET  - 2013/02/28
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate changes in self-reported fatigue and depression from four months to two years following a myocardial infarction, as well as to explore gender differences, identify the incidence of fatigue without coexisting depression and finally predict health-related quality of life at a two-year follow-up. BACKGROUND: Depression and fatigue are associated with decreased health-related quality of life after myocardial infarction. Although there is a close relationship between fatigue and depression, it has been shown that symptoms of fatigue can occur without coexisting depression. DESIGN: Quantitative and longitudinal design. METHODS: Participants (n = 155) were asked to complete the following questionnaires: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 (MFI-20) and the Short Form Survey (SF-36) following myocardial infarction (after four months and two years). Descriptive statistics, paired t-tests and multiple regressions were carried out. RESULTS: In the entire group, self-reported fatigue had decreased from four months to two years after myocardial infarction. After two years, 18% of respondents reported depression together with fatigue and 30% reported fatigued without depression. Women scored higher than men on the fatigue dimensions reduced activity, reduced motivation and mental fatigue. Moreover, the physical dimension of health-related quality of life two years after myocardial infarction was predicted by experienced general fatigue at four months. CONCLUSION: Fatigue with or without coexisting possible/probable depression remains as a significant symptom two years after myocardial infarction in nearly half of the entire group. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Fatigue is a problem following myocardial infarction. Therefore, systematic screening and early identification of patients experiencing symptoms of depression and fatigue after myocardial infarction are important for suitable care planning. In contemporary coronary care, strategies aimed at relieving fatigue should be developed.

T1  - Depression, anxiety and positive affect in people diagnosed with low-grade tumours: the role of illness perceptions
LA  - eng
SN  - 1099-1611
Y1  - 2013/06/
ET  - 2012/09/18
AB  - OBJECTIVE: People with low-grade brain tumour experience a range of emotional, behavioural and psychosocial consequences. Using Leventhal's self-regulation model to explore biopsychosocial factors associated with distress, we examine the relationships between illness perceptions, coping and depression, anxiety and positive affect. METHODS: A cross-sectional, self-report study in which 74 people (54% women) diagnosed with a low-grade brain tumour completed the Illness Perceptions Questionnaire-Revised was conducted. Mean time since diagnosis was 27.69 months (SD = 19.79). Mean age was 38.30 years (SD = 10.67). The Illness Perceptions Questionnaire-Revised, in addition to clinical, demographic and coping variables previously associated with psychological distress, was used to predict three psychological outcomes: depression, anxiety and positive affect. RESULTS: Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that a biopsychosocial causal attribution was a significant predictor of anxiety and depression. Illness identity also emerged as a significant predictor of depression scores. Coping through self-blame was the only coping variable to emerge as a significant predictor of anxiety scores. A combination of coping through venting, acceptance, positive reframing, denial, behavioural disengagement and self-blame contributed to the variance in all three psychological outcome scores. No illness perception variables significantly predicted positive affect. CONCLUSIONS: Illness perceptions play a significant role in emotional distress experienced by people with low-grade brain tumours. Illness perceptions did not play a significant role in positive affect. Coping variables were shown to significantly contribute to the scores on all three psychological outcomes. Results suggest interventions targeted at modifying illness perceptions and enhancing problem-focused coping strategies may reduce psychological distress.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the interrater reliability of the new International Behavioural Variant FTD Criteria Consortium (FTDC) criteria for behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). METHODS: Twenty standardized clinical case modules were developed for patients with a range of neurodegenerative diagnoses, including bvFTD, primary progressive aphasia (nonfluent, semantic, and logopenic variant), Alzheimer disease, and Lewy body dementia. Eighteen blinded raters reviewed the modules and 1) rated the presence or absence of core diagnostic features for the FTDC criteria, and 2) provided an overall diagnostic rating. Interrater reliability was determined by κ statistics for multiple raters with categorical ratings. RESULTS: The mean κ value for diagnostic agreement was 0.81 for possible bvFTD and 0.82 for probable bvFTD ("almost perfect agreement"). Interrater reliability for 4 of the 6 core features had "substantial" agreement (behavioral disinhibition, perseverative/compulsive, sympathy/empathy, hyperorality; κ = 0.61-0.80), whereas 2 had "moderate" agreement (apathy/inertia, neuropsychological; κ = 0.41-0.6). Clinician years of experience did not significantly influence rater accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The FTDC criteria show promise for improving the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of clinicians and researchers. As disease-altering therapies are developed, accurate differential diagnosis between bvFTD and other neurodegenerative diseases will become increasingly important.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the time from symptom onset to institutionalization in persons with young-onset dementia (YOD) and compare these findings with late-onset dementia (LOD), and to determine which factors predict institutionalization in persons with YOD compared with LOD. DESIGN/SETTING: Longitudinal study of community-dwelling patients with YOD and LOD and their caregivers. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 226 patients with YOD and 102 with LOD and their informal caregivers were recruited through memory clinics and health care facilities. MEASUREMENTS: Cox proportional hazard models were used to relate covariates with time to institutionalization. The main outcome was time from symptom onset to institutionalization. Key predictors were cohort (YOD or LOD), neuropsychiatric symptoms, caregiver distress caused by neuropsychiatric symptoms, and caregivers' sense of competence (Short Sense of Competence Questionnaire total score). RESULTS: The time from symptom onset to institutionalization was nearly 9 years for patients with YOD compared with approximately 4 years for patients with LOD. In the YOD group, apathy significantly predicted time of institutionalization. Furthermore, the caregiver's competence in caring for the person with dementia significantly predicted institutionalization in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with YOD are cared for at home for a longer period than patients with LOD. The results of this study underline the importance of a timely diagnosis for these patients and their families to facilitate the initiation of appropriate care and support. Support programs aimed at enhancing the caregivers' sense of competence and ability to deal with neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially apathy, may postpone the institutionalization of the patient.

T1  - Predictors of discrepancies in Parkinson's disease patient and caregiver ratings of apathy, disinhibition, and executive dysfunction before and after diagnosis

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) patient and caregiver reports of patient functioning are often used interchangeably in clinical and research settings; however, the consistency of these reports is largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the consistency and predictors of discrepancy between self- and caregiver reports of patient apathy, disinhibition, and executive dysfunction. Fifty-one pairs of nondemented PD patients and their caregivers completed the frontal systems behavior scale (FrSBe). Patients were administered a neuropsychological battery, and mood and burden were assessed in a subset of caregivers. Patients and caregivers significantly differed in their ratings of all retrospective prediagnosis behaviors and current levels of disinhibition. Current levodopa equivalent dosages predicted patient-caregiver rating differences in prediagnosis and current apathy and current executive dysfunction, while patient motor function, cognition, and mood failed to predict any disparities in ratings. Caregiver burden and depression were associated with apathy rating discrepancies, while burden was associated with discrepancies in ratings of disinhibition. These results suggest that consistency of patient and caregiver behavioral ratings may vary depending on the behavior assessed; and underscore the importance of considering the reporter when using subjective measures, as discrepancies in behavioral reports may be influenced by specific patient and/or caregiver symptoms or factors.

T1  - Validation of the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale in Parkinson's disease

Y1  - 2013/03/
ET  - 2012/12/14
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fatigue is a common symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, a multidimensional scale that measures the impact of fatigue on functioning has yet to be validated in this population. The aim of this study was to examine the validity of the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), a self-report measure that assesses the effects of fatigue on physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning, in a sample of nondemented PD patients. METHODS: PD patients (N = 100) completed the MFIS, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X), and several additional measures of psychosocial, cognitive, and motor functioning. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and item analysis using Cronbach's alpha were conducted to determine structural validity and internal consistency of the MFIS. Correlational analyses were performed between the MFIS and the PANAS-X fatigue subscale to evaluate convergent validity and between the MFIS and measures of depression, anxiety, apathy, and disease-related symptoms to determine divergent validity. RESULTS: The PCA identified two viable MFIS subscales: a cognitive subscale and a combination of the original scale's physical and psychosocial subscales as one factor. Item analysis revealed high internal consistency of all 21 items and the items within the two subscales. The MFIS had strong convergent validity with the PANAS-X fatigue subscale and adequate divergent validity with measures of disease stage, motor function, and cognition. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study demonstrates that the MFIS is a valid multidimensional measure that can be used to evaluate the impact of fatigue on cognitive and physical/social functioning in PD patients without dementia.

T1  - Self-reported depressive syndromes in mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1741-203X
Y1  - 2013/03/
ET  - 2012/10/19
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is suggestion that self-reported depressive syndromes can independently manifest in the general population as cognitive/affective or somatic/vegetative. The Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd edition (BDI-II), a self-report measure of depressive symptoms, has been shown to support this two-factor structure. However, this finding has not been examined in an older adult sample with cognitive impairment. In order to determine whether older adults with cognitive impairments exhibit similarly independent cognitive/affective and somatic/vegetative depressive syndromes, we explored the factor structure of the BDI-II in this population. METHODS: Participants were 228 older adults (mean age = 74, SD = 7.9) diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 137) or early Alzheimer's disease (n = 85), who completed the BDI-II as part of an outpatient neuropsychological evaluation. Exploratory principal component factor analysis with direct Oblimin rotation was conducted, and a two-factor solution was specified based on our theoretical conceptualization of the cognitive/affective and somatic/vegetative items from the scale. RESULTS: The first factor represented cognitive/affective symptoms of depression (e.g. self-dislike, pessimism, worthlessness), and accounted for 36% of the variance. Adding the second factor, reflecting somatic/vegetative items (e.g. sleep and appetite changes, loss of energy), accounted for an additional 6.8% of the variance. CONCLUSION: Results supported the presence of two distinct depressive syndromes, cognitive/affective and somatic/vegetative symptoms. Thus, cognitively impaired older adults report mood symptoms relatively similarly to younger and midlife adults. This supports the validity of self-reported mood in this group, and the results may have implications for psychiatric treatment in this population.

T1  - Major depressive disorder and factorial dimensions among individuals with recent-onset spinal cord injury
LA  - eng
SN  - 1939-1544
Y1  - 2013/02/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examine the rates of major depressive disorder, single episode determined by the Inventory to Diagnose Depression (IDD) in a clinical sample of persons with recent-onset spinal cord injury (SCI; ≤52 weeks) participating in an inpatient SCI rehabilitation program. We also analyzed the factor structure of the IDD measure in an attempt to replicate the factor structure reported by Frank et al. (1992), and we examined item endorsement patterns. DESIGN: A retrospective chart review was conducted. Participants were 354 individuals (93 women, 261 men) in an inpatient SCI rehabilitation program. RESULTS: Fifteen percent of the sample met criteria for a major depressive disorder (MDD). A higher rate of depression was observed among women. A "dysphoria" factor accounted for 24% of the variance in the final four-factor model. The four-factor solution explained a total of 35.5% of the variance, with an "anhedonia" factor contributing 4.6%, a "sleep" factor contributing 3.5%, and an "appetite" factor contributing 3.5%, respectively. Items assessing symptoms of insomnia, weight loss, worrying about health, and decreased energy had the highest percentage of endorsement to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for clinical significance. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of single episodes of MDD determined by the IDD parallels the rate observed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The factor structure of the IDD was similar to that reported by Frank et al. (1992). Information provided by the IDD about the presence and severity of MDD symptoms can inform interventions for persons with SCI.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Somatically ill patients in somatic rehabilitation often show comorbid psychological distress and mental disorders. In the framework of the implementation of a stepwise psychodiagnostic procedure, the present study investigated the intention to use and the use of treatment due to psychological distress. METHODOLOGY: Cohort study with a 6-months follow-up in 5 orthopedic, cardiologic and oncologic inpatient rehabilitation clinics (n=1 374). Psychological distress, sociodemographic data, intention to use psychotherapeutic or psychiatric treatments and the use of health care offers due to psychological distress were assessed by means of questionnaires. RESULTS: Every third patient (34%) was psychologically distressed at the beginning of rehabilitation. A positive intention to use psychotherapeutic or psychiatric treatment was reported by 79% of the psychologically distressed patients. 6 months after the end of rehabilitation, 26% of the patients who were psychologically distressed at the beginning of rehabilitation, had received treatment for mental health reasons. Reasons for non-utilization of treatment included lack of subjective need (45%) and lack of interest in treatment despite a perceived need (30%). Further 25% were considering treatment or were seeking appropriate treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Psychologically distressed rehabilitation patients show a high intention to undergo treatment. However, they show a clearly diminished use of post-rehabilitative treatments due to mental health problems. Hence, the promotion of motivation as well as the management of treatment barriers for improving post-rehabilitative use in psychologically distressed rehabilitants are of particular importance.

T1  - Post-stroke apathy: an exploratory longitudinal study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1421-9786
Y1  - 2013
ET  - 2013/06/05
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. METHODS: Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (χ(2) and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. RESULTS: We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. CONCLUSION: Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms in amnestic mild cognitive impairment: increased risk and faster progression to dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-5828
Y1  - 2013/01/
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) but its role as a predictive factor for the progression to dementia is still not clear. The objective of this study is to identify NPS that predict the progression from amnestic MCI (a-MCI) to dementia using an easy to administer screening tool for NPS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 132 patients with a-MCI were assessed for NPS by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and followed to detect progression to dementia. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 3.5±2.9 years and rate of progression to dementia 28.8%. Two items of NPI were found to be independent risk factors for progression, nighttime behavioural disturbance (hazard ratio(HR)=2.2, 95%CI=1.10-4.43), anxiety (HR=2.5, 95%CI=1.01-6.20) and apathy (HR=2.2, 95%CI=1.003-4.820). The risk of progression increased with higher score on NPI (HR=1.046 per point, 95%CI=1.019- 1.073), and with a higher number of items of NPI affected (HR=3.6 per item, 95%CI=2.0-6.4). Faster progression to dementia was observed in patients with either nighttime behavioural disturbance, apathy or anxiety (4.6 vs. 8.3 years, 5.3 vs. 8.4 years and 3.0 vs. 7.7 years respectively, p < 0.01) as well as in those with a higher number of items affected (no items = 9.2 years, 1-3 items = 6.6 years and > 3 items = 2.9 years, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Assessing a broad spectrum of NPS can help identify patients with a-MCI presenting a higher risk for progression to dementia. This can be useful to select patients for closer follow-up, clinical trials and future therapeutic interventions.

ET  - 2012/07/22
AB  - Non-motor symptoms (NMS) of Parkinson's disease (PD) have only recently been increasingly recognized for their impact on a patient's quality of life. In this study, we applied the validated, comprehensive self-completed NMS questionnaire for PD (NMS Quest) to 101 patients with young-onset PD (onset between 21 and 45 years, YOPD) and 107 patients with late-onset PD (onset of PD ≥ 55 years, LOPD). The mean total NMS (NMSQ-T) was 11.9 ± 6.0 (range: 0 to of a maximum of 26) in LOPD and 7.7 ± 5.8 (range: 0 to of a maximum of 26) in YOPD (p < 0.05). Compared to YOPD, dribbling of saliva, loss of taste/smell, nocturia, forgetfulness, loss of interest, hallucinations, lack of concentration, anxiety, change in libido and difficulty in sexual activities, were significantly more prevalent in LOPD. The only NMS more prevalent in YOPD were restless legs and sweating, although such findings might be associated with drug effects. Among the nine NMS Quest domains, in both LOPD and YOPD patients the three most prevalent domains were depression/anxiety, urinary and sexual. Also, in both groups, hallucinations/delusions had the lowest frequency. In the multivariate linear regression model, the Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stage of the disease and activities of daily living scores in YOPD patients, while only the HY stage in LOPD patients appeared to be statistically significant predictors of increasing number of NMS. In contrast to a previous suggestion that YOPD patients might have an increased risk for NMS, we found a higher prevalence of NMS in LOPD patients than in those with YOPD.

T1  - Validation of the Head and Neck Patient Symptom Checklist as a nutrition impact symptom assessment tool for head and neck cancer patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 1433-7339
Y1  - 2013/01/
ET  - 2012/05/16
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test the validity of the Head and Neck Patient Symptom Checklist (HNSC). METHODS: Three hundred and sixty-eight treatment-naive individuals with head and neck cancer prospectively completed the HNSC and the Patient-Generated Symptom Global Assessment (PG-SGA). The predictive validity was determined by comparing the HNSC symptoms interference scores to the PG-SGA scores. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the HNSC symptoms scores associated with reduced dietary intake, ≥ 5 % weight loss over 6 months, and reduced functional performance (FP). RESULTS: HNSC sensitivity (79-98 %), specificity (99-100 %), positive predictive value (92-100 %), and negative predictive value (94-100 %) were excellent, and the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.92. The multivariate logistic regression showed that advanced tumor stage, pain, loss of appetite (LOA), and difficulty swallowing significantly predicted dietary intake. Advanced tumor stage, LOA, and difficulty swallowing were also significant predictors of ≥ 5 % weight loss over 6 months. LOA, difficulty swallowing, feeling full, and lack of energy were significant predictors of reduced FP. CONCLUSIONS: The HNSC appears to be a valid tool for determining symptoms interfering with dietary intake of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. This instrument may aid in early identification of symptoms that place HNC patients at risk for reductions in dietary intake, weight, and functional performance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Physical activity determinants are subject to change when confronted with the diagnosis of 'cancer' and new cancer-related determinants appear. The aim of the present study is to compare the contribution of cancer-related determinants with more general ones in explaining physical activity 3 weeks to 6 months post-treatment. METHODS: A theory-based and validated questionnaire was used to identify physical activity levels (total and domain-specific) and associated determinants among 464 breast cancer survivors (aged 18 to 65 years) 3 weeks to 6 months post-treatment. RESULTS: Descriptive analyses showed higher scores for general determinants in comparison with cancer-related determinants. Nevertheless, regression analyses showed that both general and cancer-related determinants explained total and domain-specific physical activity. Self-efficacy, enjoyment, social support, lack of time and lack of company were important general determinants. The perception of returning to normal life, cancer-related barriers (fatigue, lack of energy and physical side effects) and self-efficacy in overcoming these barriers were important cancer-related determinants. Although results differed according to the women's working status and the physical activity domain, general self-efficacy explained most physical activity types in both groups. CONCLUSION: Comparable with the general population, enhancing breast cancer survivors' self-efficacy in being sufficiently physically active seems to be important in physical activity interventions post-treatment. However, interventions should be tailored to the experienced symptoms and working status of the women.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Routine assessment of daytime function in Sleep Medicine has focused on "tendency to fall asleep" in soporific circumstances, to the exclusion of "wakefulness inability" or inability to maintain wakefulness, and fatigue/tiredness/lack of energy. The objective was to establish reliability and discriminant validity of a test for wakefulness inability and fatigue, and to test its superiority against the criterion standard for evaluation of sleepiness-the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). METHODS: A 12-item self-administered instrument, the Sleepiness-Wakefulness Inability and Fatigue Test (SWIFT), was developed and administered, with ESS, to 256 adults ≥ 18 years of age (44 retook the tests a month later); consecutive patients with symptoms of sleep disorders including 286 with obstructive sleep apnea ([OSA], apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 5/h sleep on polysomnography [PSG]), 49 evaluated with PSG and multiple sleep latency test for narcolepsy and 137 OSA patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). RESULTS: SWIFT had internal consistency 0.87 and retest intraclass coefficient 0.82. Factor analysis revealed 2 factors-general wakefulness inability and fatigue (GWIF) and driving wakefulness inability and fatigue (DWIF). Normal subjects differed from patients in ESS, SWIFT, GWIF, and DWIF. SWIFT and GWIF (but not DWIF) had higher area under ROC curve, Youden's index, and better positive and negative likelihood ratios than ESS. ESS, SWIFT, GWIF, and DWIF improved with CPAP. Improvements in SWIFT, GWIF, and DWIF (but not ESS) were significantly correlated with CPAP compliance. CONCLUSIONS: SWIFT is reliable and valid. SWIFT and its factor GWIF have a discriminant ability superior to that of the ESS.

T1  - Psychometric properties of the multidimensional fatigue inventory in Brazilian Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-6513
Y1  - 2012/12/
ET  - 2012/06/13
AB  - CONTEXT: Fatigue is the most common symptom among Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Brazilian version of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI). METHODS: The MFI was translated into Brazilian Portuguese using established forward-backward translation procedures, and the psychometric properties were evaluated in a sample of 200 Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors. The psychometric properties evaluated included internal consistency and construct validity. The MFI was administered along with the informed consent form. RESULTS: The overall Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the 20 items was 0.84, ranging from 0.59 to 0.81 for each of the five scales. Correlations between items and scales ranged from 0.32 to 0.72. The factor analysis yielded a five-factor solution that explained 65% of the variance. The first factor merged the original "general fatigue" and "physical fatigue" scales, as has been previously reported. The second factor identified the original "mental fatigue" scale and the fifth factor identified the original "reduced activity" scale. Questions from the original "reduced motivation" scale were represented in both factors three and four. CONCLUSION: The Brazilian version of the MFI showed satisfactory psychometric properties and can be considered a valid research tool for assessing cancer-related fatigue.

T1  - Learned helplessness among families and surrogate decision-makers of patients admitted to medical, surgical, and trauma ICUs
LA  - eng

Y1  - 2012/12/
AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the prevalence of and clinical variables associated with learned helplessness, a psychologic state characterized by reduced motivation, difficulty in determining causality, and depression, in family members of patients admitted to ICUs. METHODS: We conducted an observational survey study of a prospectively defined cohort of family members, spouses, and partners of patients admitted to surgical, medical, and trauma ICUs at a large academic medical center. Two validated instruments, the Learned Helplessness Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale, were used, and self-report of patient clinical characteristics and subject demographics were collected. RESULTS: Four hundred ninety-nine family members were assessed. Of these, 238 of 460 (51.7%) had responses consistent with a significant degree of learned helplessness. Among surrogate decision-makers, this proportion was 50% (92 of 184). Characteristics associated with significant learned helplessness included grade or high school education (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.29-8.27; P = .01) and Perceived Stress Scale score > 18 (OR, 4.15; 95% CI, 2.65-6.50; P < .001). The presence of a patient advance directive or do not resuscitate (DNR) order was associated with reduced odds of significant learned helplessness (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32-0.98; P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of family members of patients in the ICU experience significant learned helplessness. Risk factors for learned helplessness include lower educational levels, absence of an advance directive or DNR order, and higher stress levels among family members. Significant learned helplessness in family members may have negative implications in the collaborative decision-making process.

T1  - A short scale for evaluation of neuropsychiatric disorders in Parkinson's disease: first psychometric approach
LA  - eng
SN  - 1432-1459
Y1  - 2012/11/
ET  - 2012/04/18
AB  - The neuropsychiatric symptoms and behavioral disorders affecting Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are common and disabling. A PD-specific interview-based 12-item scale, the Scale for Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders in Parkinson's Disease (SEND-PD), has been developed to assess the severity of neuropsychiatric manifestations. The present study is aimed at testing some basic psychometric attributes of this scale. A total of 633 consecutive patients and their caregivers were included in this cross-sectional, multicenter, observational study. In addition to the tested scale, the following assessments were applied: Hoehn and Yahr staging, Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease Motor and Psychiatric complications, MiniMental State Examination, Clinical Impression of Severity Index, and the Zarit Caregiver Burden Inventory. Patients in all stages of disease were included and 18.38 % were demented. The SEND-PD was responded by patients (86.16 %), caregivers (13.15 %), or both (0.69 %). Three factors (accounting for 66.63 % of the variance) were identified and considered as subscales: Psychotic symptoms, Mood/Apathy, and Impulse control disorders. The subscales showed satisfactory scaling assumptions (multitrait-item success rate 100 %) and internal consistency (alpha indices >0.70). The convergent validity with other measures of psychiatric symptoms and the discriminant validity to distinguish between categories of patients' age, duration and severity of disease, and dopaminergic treatment were satisfactory. The precision of the scale dimensions was acceptable. The SEND-PD performed as an acceptable, consistent, valid, and precise scale for evaluation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherence to tuberculosis (TB) treatment is troublesome, due to long therapy duration, quick therapeutic response which allows the patient to disregard about the rest of their treatment and the lack of motivation on behalf of the patient for improved. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a scoring system to predict the probability of lost to follow-up outcome in TB patients as a way to identify patients suitable for directly observed treatments (DOT) and other interventions to improve adherence. METHODS: Two prospective cohorts, were used to develop and validate a logistic regression model. A scoring system was constructed, based on the coefficients of factors associated with a lost to follow-up outcome. The probability of lost to follow-up outcome associated with each score was calculated. Predictions in both cohorts were tested using receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). RESULTS: The best model to predict lost to follow-up outcome included the following characteristics: immigration (1 point value), living alone (1 point) or in an institution (2 points), previous anti-TB treatment (2 points), poor patient understanding (2 points), intravenous drugs use (IDU) (4 points) or unknown IDU status (1 point). Scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 points were associated with a lost to follow-up probability of 2,2% 5,4% 9,9%, 16,4%, 15%, and 28%, respectively. The ROC curve for the validation group demonstrated a good fit (AUC: 0,67 [95% CI; 0,65-0,70]). CONCLUSION: This model has a good capacity to predict a lost to follow-up outcome. Its use could help TB Programs to determine which patients are good candidates for DOT and other strategies to improve TB treatment adherence.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric symptom clusters of Alzheimer's disease in Hong Kong Chinese: prevalence and confirmatory factor analysis of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory
LA  - eng
SN  - 1741-203X
Y1  - 2012/09/
ET  - 2012/04/25
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the clustering of symptoms on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the relative prevalence of symptom clusters in mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed on the polychoric correlation matrix of 12 NPI items (scored yes or no) using the weighted least squares with mean and variance adjustment (WLSMV) estimator in Mplus (N = 224 community-dwelling Chinese persons with mild/moderate AD). Severity of AD was determined by Clinical Dementia Rating scores. The relative model fit of three competing measurement models (also known as factor structures) was tested using a modified χ2 difference test. Prevalence rates across mild and moderate stages were compared using χ2 tests. Furthermore, the measurement model of choice was cross-validated in an independent sample of 181 community-dwelling persons with dementia. RESULTS: CFA supported a four-factor model, namely behavioral problems (agitation/aggressiveness, disinhibition, irritability, and aberrant motor behavior), psychosis (delusions and hallucinations), mood disturbance (depression, anxiety, sleep, appetite, and apathy), and euphoria (a stand-alone item that is equivalent to the factor). The most prevalent symptom clusters were behavioral (72%) and mood (69%) disturbances, followed by psychosis (45%). Euphoria was rare (6%). All syndromes were more prevalent in moderate than in mild stage, except for euphoria. In addition, the four-factor model was replicated in the cross-validation sample. CONCLUSIONS: The four syndromes provide a parsimonious conceptualization of neuropsychiatric symptoms corresponding to clinical observations and neurochemical changes of the disease. The independent replication in the second sample supports generalization of the four-factor model in Chinese persons with AD.

T1  - The Oxford Questionnaire on the Emotional Side-effects of Antidepressants (OQuESA): development, validity, reliability and sensitivity to change
LA  - eng
SN  - 1573-2517
Y1  - 2012/09/
ET  - 2012/03/02
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some patients with major depression report a restricted range of emotions that may appear to arise as a side-effect of treatment with antidepressants. It is uncertain whether this phenomenon, sometimes called emotional blunting, represents residual symptoms of depression or side-effects of antidepressant treatment. There is currently no adequate instrument to measure this phenomenon. METHODS: A draft questionnaire was developed from patient-derived qualitative data, refined using cognitive interviewing, and administered on three occasions to patients taking antidepressants. Statistical methods including factor analysis were used to reduce the size of the draft questionnaire, and to assess the performance of the resulting Oxford Questionnaire on the Emotional Side-effects of Antidepressants (OQuESA). RESULTS: 207 patients completed the OQuESA on at least one occasion. Their BDI-II scores and self-reported emotional blunting were spread across the possible range. The factor analysis resulted in four dimensions: 'not caring', 'emotional detachment', 'reduction in positive emotions', and 'general reduction in emotions'. The OQuESA appears to be acceptable, valid, and reliable, with sensitivity to change. CONCLUSIONS: The OQuESA offers promise as an effective self-report measure of the symptoms of emotional blunting in patients with depression. It can be used as a clinical tool, to facilitate the identification of patients with the syndrome of emotional blunting. It should also be used in research studies, to advance our understanding of the nature, causes and treatment of this phenomenon.

T1  - Decreased daytime motor activity associated with apathy in Alzheimer disease: an actigraphic study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1545-7214
Y1  - 2012/09/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Across all stages of Alzheimer disease (AD), apathy is the most common neuropsychiatric symptom. Studies using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) have found that apathy is present in up to 70% of individuals with Alzheimer disease. One of the main difficulties in assessing apathy and other neuropsychiatric symptoms is the absence of reliable, objective measures. Motor activity assessment using ambulatory actigraphy could provide an indirect, objective evaluation of apathy. The aim of our study was to assess the relationship between apathy and daytime motor activity in AD, using ambulatory actigraphy. METHODS: One hundred seven AD outpatients wore a wrist actigraph (Motionlogger) during seven consecutive 24-hour periods to evaluate motor activity. Participants were divided into two subgroups according to their apathy subscores on the NPI: individuals with apathy (NPI-apathy subscores >4) and those without. Daytime mean motor activity scores were compared between the two subgroups. RESULTS: Individuals with AD who had symptoms of apathy (n = 43; age = 79 ± 4.7 years; Mini-Mental State Examination = 20.9 ± 4.8) had significantly lower daytime mean motor activity than AD patients without apathy (n = 64; age = 76.3 ± 7.7; Mini-Mental State Examination = 21.5 ± 4.7), while nighttime mean motor activity did not significantly differ between the two subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Ambulatory actigraphy could be added to currently used questionnaires as a simple, objective technique for assessing apathy in the routine assessment of AD patients.

T1  - Patients undergoing subacute rehabilitation have accurate expectations of their health-related quality of life at discharge
LA  - eng
SN  - 1477-7525
Y1  - 2012/08/17
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expectations held by patients and health professionals may affect treatment choices and participation (by both patients and health professionals) in therapeutic interventions in contemporary patient-centered healthcare environments. If patients in rehabilitation settings overestimate their discharge health-related quality of life, they may become despondent as their progress falls short of their expectations. On the other hand, underestimating their discharge health-related quality of life may lead to a lack of motivation to participate in therapies if they do not perceive likely benefit. There is a scarcity of empirical evidence evaluating whether patients' expectations of future health states are accurate. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy with which older patients admitted for subacute in-hospital rehabilitation can anticipate their discharge health-related quality of life. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal cohort investigation of agreement between patients' anticipated discharge health-related quality of life (as reported on the EQ-5D instrument at admission to a rehabilitation unit) and their actual self-reported health-related quality of life at the time of discharge from this unit was undertaken. The mini-mental state examination was used as an indicator of patients' cognitive ability. RESULTS: Overall, 232(85%) patients had all assessment data completed and were included in analysis. Kappa scores ranged from 0.42-0.68 across the five EQ-5D domains and two patient cognition groups. The percentage of exact correct matches within each domain ranged from 69% to 85% across domains and cognition groups. Overall 40% of participants in each cognition group correctly anticipated all of their self-reported discharge EQ-5D domain responses. CONCLUSIONS: Patients admitted for subacute in-hospital rehabilitation were able to anticipate their discharge health-related quality of life on the EQ-5D instrument with a moderate level of accuracy. This finding adds to the foundational empirical work supporting joint treatment decision making and patient-centered models of care during rehabilitation following acute illness or injury. Accurate patient expectations of the impact of treatment (or disease progression) on future health-related related quality of life is likely to allow patients and health professionals to successfully target interventions to priority areas where meaningful gains can be achieved.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize dietary habits and eating patterns in patients with a urea cycle disorder (UCD), and to identify dietary habits that may serve as clues to lead to earlier diagnosis of these disorders. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective study of clinical and dietary data from hospital records of all patients with UCD (n = 90) attending the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne between 1972 and 2010. RESULTS: Protein aversion, food refusal, frequent vomiting, poor appetite, and adverse reaction to high-protein-containing foods were documented in the majority of patients with available detailed dietary protein intake data. Fourteen of the 90 admissions for metabolic deterioration in which information regarding the precipitating factor(s) were available were directly related to protein intake (5 higher and 9 lower than prescribed). CONCLUSION: Protein aversion is a common feature of UCD and may serve as a diagnostic clue in patients presenting with food refusal, recurrent vomiting, behavioral problems, mental retardation, and "unexplained" episodes of altered consciousness. Dietary history should be included in the investigation of these symptoms, which might lead to earlier diagnosis. Metabolic decompensation is more frequently related to low energy/protein intake than to high protein intake in these patients. Special attention should be given to protein aversion, which often leads to eating patterns that make it difficult for a patient to achieve the prescribed daily protein requirement.

T1  - Anxiety and depression are associated with coping strategies in caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients: results from the MÁLAGA-AD study
LA  - eng

Y1  - 2012/08/
ET  - 2012/02/16
AB  - BACKGROUND: Caregiving for people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly stressful and has significant negative consequences, such as anxiety and depression. Previous research offers conflicting findings as to whether coping strategies are associated with greater psychological distress or not. We conducted this study with a view to obtaining new data regarding the association of coping strategies and psychological distress in AD caregivers. METHODS: Eighty people with AD and their primary caregivers living in the community were recruited from local health services. Purposive recruitment was carried out to ensure that the sample was representative of people living with dementia in terms of dementia severity, gender, and care setting. We used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory to measure anxiety, the Beck Depression Inventory to measure depression, and the Coping Strategies Inventory to measure coping strategies. RESULTS: Most caregivers reported higher anxiety and depression levels. Use of disengagement coping strategies (Wald = 3.35, p = 0.01) and higher caregiver burden (Wald = 4.83, p = 0.02) predicted anxiety on logistic regression. In turn, use of disengagement coping strategies (Wald = 12.48, p = 0.001) and higher caregiver burden (Wald = 6.91, p = 0.009) predicted depression on logistic regression. CONCLUSION: These results may be useful for designing treatment interventions that aim to modify the use of coping strategies and thus reduces caregiver anxiety and depression.

T1  - Predicting outcome of depression using the depressive symptom profile: the Leiden Routine Outcome Monitoring Study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1520-6394
Y1  - 2012/06/
ET  - 2012/05/03
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the predictive value of items for individual depressive symptoms measured with the self-rated Beck Depression Inventory-Revised (BDI-II) self-report scale on outcome in a large naturalistic cohort of depressive outpatients. METHODS: We used a cohort of 1,489 adult patients aged 18-65 years with major depressive disorder or dysthymic disorder established with the MINI-Plus diagnostic interview. All patients had a routine outcome monitoring baseline measurement in 2004-2009, with a maximum of 2 years follow-up. We used multivariable Cox regression models to predict remission (MADRS < 10; where MADRS stands for Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale) and response (≥50% improvement), and adjusted for clinical and demographic characteristics (i.e. marital status, level of education, working status, comorbid anxiety, avoidant and borderline personality traits, and suicidality) that were identified as predictors in earlier studies. RESULTS: Of the 21 BDI-II items, the items "pessimism" and "loss of energy" independently predicted for both remission and response. For pessimism, the hazard ratio (HR) for remission was 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73-0.89, P < .001) and for loss of energy, the HR was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.72-0.92, P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings of robust prediction of poor outcome by baseline items of "pessimism" and "loss of energy" in a naturalistic treatment setting may help clinicians to identify depressive patients in need for additional or alternative therapeutic approaches.

T1  - Reliability and structural validity of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-5126
Y1  - 2012/06/
ET  - 2012/02/22
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is commonly used in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, most measurement properties have not been investigated in this population. The aim of this study was to investigate internal consistency, test-retest reliability, measurement error, structural validity, and floor and ceiling effects of the MFI in PD. METHODS: Patients with PD (N = 153) completed the MFI at baseline and week 3 in a randomized clinical trial. Cronbach's α, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and the smallest detectable change (SDC) were calculated. Bland and Altman analysis was performed. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to explore structural validity. Floor and ceiling effects were investigated. RESULTS: Cronbach's α for the MFI-total and subscales ranged from 0.74 (reduced motivation (RM)) to 0.92 (MFI-total). ICC's ranged from 0.65 (mental fatigue (MF) to 0.81 (physical fatigue (PF)), SDC ranged from 4 points (PF and RM) to 15 points (MFI-total). Bland and Altman analysis showed no systematic differences between assessments. A floor effect was found for MF and ceiling effects for PF and reduced activity (RA). A four-factor model was extracted, combining general fatigue (GF) and PF as one factor. CONCLUSIONS: The MFI is reliable and valid to assess fatigue in patients with PD. Clinicians and researchers interested in assessing specific aspects of fatigue should consider interpreting GF and PF as one subscale measuring physical aspects of fatigue. To establish whether the MFI can detect meaningful changes, studies on anchor-based responsiveness and the minimal important change are needed in PD.

T1  - Adherence to CPAP therapy improves quality of life and reduces symptoms among obstructive sleep apnea syndrome patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 1522-1709
Y1  - 2012/06/
ET  - 2011/06/11
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to asses quality of life and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) patients after adhering to 6 months of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. METHODS: A group of 50 patients (41 men and 9 women) were diagnosed by polysomnography and treated with CPAP therapy for 6 months. Their symptoms and health-related quality of life were assessed by administering a validated and translated version of the sleep apnea quality of life index (SAQLI). Sleepiness was measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and through electronic monitoring of CPAP usage per night of sleep. RESULTS: Mean CPAP usage was 4.5 ± 0.5 h per night. Comparisons between quality of life indexes before and after CPAP treatment showed an improvement in the total SAQLI score (3.8 ± 0.9 vs. 5.8 ± 0.8 after CPAP, p < 0.01), in daily functioning (4.2 ± 1.4 vs. 6.0 ± 0.9, p < 0.01), social interactions (4.8 ± 1.3 vs.6.3 ± 0.7, p < 0.01), emotional functioning (4.4 ± 1.4 vs. 5.7 ± 1.0, p < 0.01), symptoms (1.6 ± 0.8 vs. 5.8 ± 1.2, p < 0.01), and in the ESS (13.7 ± 6.5 vs. 3.9 ± 3.8, p < 0.01). Regarding the patients' symptoms, improvement was noticed for "sleepiness while watching a spectacle" (96%), "reading" (95%), "carrying on a conversation" (95%), "driving" (92.9%), "restless sleep" (87.8%), and "urinating more than once per night" (84.8%). Smaller improvements were observed for the reported "dry mouth-throat upon awakening" (36.1%),"excessive fatigue" (54.5%), and "decreased energy" (55.3%). CONCLUSION: We conclude that OSAS patients who adhere to nighttime CPAP therapy show significant improvement of their quality of life, daytime sleepiness, and other symptoms after 6 months of treatment with CPAP.

T1  - Diagnosis and assessment of apathy in Chinese patients with Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1879-1360
Y1  - 2012/05/
ET  - 2012/02/02
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a major component of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other types of dementia. Most researchers have reached a consensus on a new set of diagnostic criteria for apathy (DCA) recently. However, no relevant reports on apathy exist for AD patients in Asian countries yet. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of apathy in Chinese AD patients. METHODS: 83 AD patients were recruited for a cross-sectional observational study. Following the new diagnostic criteria for apathy (DCA) and DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), each patient was assessed successively by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-apathy subscale (NPI-apathy), the Geriatric Depression Screening scale (GDS), and the Caregiver Burden Scale (CBS). RESULTS: According to the DCA, we found that the frequency of apathy in Chinese AD patients reached 61.4%. The DCA had very good standard validity and internal consistency. The frequency of apathy was not significantly associated with that of depression, whereas there was a significant association between apathy and more severe cognitive deficits. Caregiver burden was significantly associated with severity of apathy. CONCLUSIONS: From the symptoms of a group of Chinese AD patients, we summarized a set of effective methods for the diagnosis and assessment of apathy.

T1  - Validation of apathy evaluation scale and assessment of severity of apathy in Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1440-1819
Y1  - 2012/04/
AB  - AIM: Apathy is a well-recognized symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the present study was to validate the Taiwanese version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale, clinician version (AES-C) and assess the severity of apathy in patients with AD. METHODS: Comprehensive evaluations were conducted in a total of 144 AD patients. This study used a cross-sectional comparative design. Data were collected from clinical interviews using the AES, the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR). RESULTS: Internal consistency was indicated by Cronbach's alphas of 0.85; test-retest reliability was 0.89 over a period of 3 days. Criterion-related validity was supported by the fact that AES-C significantly correlated with the apathy scores of the NPI. Factor analysis indicated a three-factor structure. Convergent validity was supported by a positive correlation between the AES-C score and the anxiety score of the NPI. Discriminant validity was supported by the fact that the AES-C scores did not correlate with the depression subscale of the NPI, and the correlation between the AES-C score and the euphoria score of the NPI score was negative. Known-group validity was supported by results showing that AD patients in a moderate stage of dementia (CDR = 2) had significantly higher scores on the AES-C than patients with mild-stage dementia (CDR = 1). CONCLUSION: The AES-C is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring symptoms of apathy among AD patients in Taiwan.

T1  - Suboptimal perception of illness due to self-realization constraints impairs psychological welfare in surgical patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-734X
Y1  - 2012/04/
ET  - 2011/12/21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recognizing patients' psychological problems and understanding their social needs constitute important tasks for medical personnel, because these issues substantially contribute to overall outcome of treatment. People afflicted with surgical diseases need to determine the sense of everyday pursuits and activities and balance it against the therapeutic process. The aim of the study was to assess the relationships between the perception of illness, satisfaction with life and meaning of life among surgical patients. METHODS: A total of 225 patients undergoing surgical treatment in the thoracic surgery department were enrolled in the questionnaire study using Multidimensional Essence of Disease and Illness Scale (MEDIS), Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) and Life Meaningfulness Scale (LMS). Relationships between variables were assessed with Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: The analysis disclosed negative correlations between the perception of the disease in the light of self-realization constraints and the feeling of satisfaction with one's life (R = -0.25; P < 0.01), an affective component of the LMS (R = -0.29; P < 0.001) and the total result of the LMS (R = -0.21; P < 0.01). Similar relationships were observed between the MEDIS dimension describing a disease as a social withdrawal and the total result of the SWLS (R = -0.21; P < 0.05) and the affective component of the LMS (R = -0.23; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal hospitalization-related perception of the disease due to self-realization constraints profoundly impairs psychological welfare of patients and may exert negative impact on the overall outcome of treatment. We believe that surgical patients require early psychological, social and spiritual support to prevent these harmful psycho-social consequences of illness and hospital stay. Preoperative clinical application of presented scales may be useful to select patients who require more psychological attention in providing information about planned surgical treatment and expected outcomes.

T1  - The assessment of low mood in stroke patients with aphasia: reliability and validity of the 10-item Hospital version of the Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire (SADQH-10)
LA  - eng

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the psychometric properties of an observational screening measure of depressive symptoms (SADQH-10; 10-item Hospital version of the Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire) for use in stroke patients with aphasia and to determine the convergent and divergent validity of the SADQH-10. DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort. SETTING: Hospital and community. PARTICIPANTS: Stroke patients with aphasia (n = 165) were recruited through hospital wards and community services as part of a randomised controlled trial. Participants were aged 29 to 94 years (68.6 ± 12.1) and 65% were men. RESULTS: The SADQH-10 demonstrated good internal consistency (α = 0.77). Factor analysis revealed the SADQH-10 to be measuring three constructs (social interaction and physical pain, tearfulness, loss of interest and motivation). Significant correlations were found between scores on the SADQH-10 and VAMS 'sad' item (r(s) = 0.297, P < 0.01) but not with the VASES 'depression' item (r(s) = 0.064, P = 0.590) or measures of physical and language abilities. CONCLUSIONS: The SADQH-10 is both a valid and reliable observational screening measure of depressive symptoms for stroke patients with aphasia.

T1  - Differences in psychological perception of lung cancer between patients, medical staff and medical students
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-734X
Y1  - 2012/03/
ET  - 2011/12/21
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In clinical practice, medical staff is often unaware that what they think about patient's disease differs much from the perceptions and feelings of the patient. The aim of the study was to analyse the differences in psychological perception of lung cancer between patients treated with combined regimen for lung cancer (n = 30), medical staff (n = 94) and medical students (n = 303). METHODS: A total of 427 persons were enrolled in this questionnaire study using Imagination and Perception of Illness Scale (IPIS) by Sak. The IPIS scale items described: loss of motivation to carry out specific activities (eight items), mental sphere destruction (six items), physical sphere destruction (eight items), pessimism (four items), being a burden to others (three items) and loss of control over the illness (three items). A seven-point scale from '0', meaning the choice of maximum positive feature, to '6', meaning the choice of maximum negative feature, was used. The higher result obtained within a given factor signified the more negative perception of the illness. RESULTS: In all IPIS items, the results among patients were significantly lower than among medical staff or students (P = 0.018 and P = 0.001, respectively). Medical staff and students perceive lung cancer as causing more profound destruction in patient's mental and physical spheres than patients do. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated for lung cancer with combined regimen perceive their disease more optimistically than what is imagined by medical staff and students, and may underestimate the threat. It may be explained by psychological adaptation of patients to their disease during prolonged treatment. We believe that informing lung cancer patients in detail about their illness should be recommended to enhance self-awareness and doctor-patient cooperation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the Neuropsychiatric Inventory apathy subscale (NPIa) with the abbreviated Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-10) on discriminant validity and on their performance to distinguish residents as apathetic or nonapathetic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional design. SETTING: Nursing home. PARTICIPANTS: 100 residents of 4 dementia special care units (n = 58) and 3 somatic units (n = 42). MEASUREMENTS: Primary professional caregivers were interviewed to score the AES-10 and NPIa. The elderly care physician and the psychologist of each unit examined residents for clinical apathy using diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: The AES-10 and NPIa correlated moderately with each other (r(s) = 0.62, P < .0001). The AES-10 correlated weakly (r(s) = 0.27, P = .024) and the NPIa moderately (r(s) = 0.46, P = .001) with the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72 (P < .01) for AES-10 and 0.67 (P < .05) for NPIa. The AES-10 produced higher sums of sensitivity and negative predictive value than the NPIa. Explorative analyses revealed that both instruments produced higher scores in dementia independently of having an apathy diagnosis, whereas AUCs were significant in nondementia (AES-10: AUC = 0.88, P < .001; NPIa: AUC = 0.77, P = .023), but not in dementia. CONCLUSION: Both the AES-10 and NPIa may be used to distinguish apathetic from nonapathetic residents in a heterogeneous sample with and without dementia, or in residents without dementia. The AES-10 may be preferable to the NPIa apathy subscale when ruling out or screening for apathy. The performance of the scales against diagnostic criteria of apathy in dementia need to be further examined.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid demographic ageing is a growing public health issue in many low- and middle-income countries (LAMICs). Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a construct frequently used to define groups of people who may be at risk of developing dementia, crucial for targeting preventative interventions. However, little is known about the prevalence or impact of MCI in LAMIC settings. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data were analysed from cross-sectional surveys established by the 10/66 Dementia Research Group and carried out in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, China, and India on 15,376 individuals aged 65+ without dementia. Standardised assessments of mental and physical health, and cognitive function were carried out including informant interviews. An algorithm was developed to define Mayo Clinic amnestic MCI (aMCI). Disability (12-item World Health Organization disability assessment schedule [WHODAS]) and informant-reported neuropsychiatric symptoms (neuropsychiatric inventory [NPI-Q]) were measured. After adjustment, aMCI was associated with disability, anxiety, apathy, and irritability (but not depression); between-country heterogeneity in these associations was only significant for disability. The crude prevalence of aMCI ranged from 0.8% in China to 4.3% in India. Country differences changed little (range 0.6%-4.6%) after standardization for age, gender, and education level. In pooled estimates, aMCI was modestly associated with male gender and fewer assets but was not associated with age or education. There was no significant between-country variation in these demographic associations. CONCLUSIONS: An algorithm-derived diagnosis of aMCI showed few sociodemographic associations but was consistently associated with higher disability and neuropsychiatric symptoms in addition to showing substantial variation in prevalence across LAMIC populations. Longitudinal data are needed to confirm findings-in particular, to investigate the predictive validity of aMCI in these settings and risk/protective factors for progression to dementia; however, the large number affected has important implications in these rapidly ageing settings.

T1  - Psychometric properties of the Starkstein Apathy Scale in patients with early untreated Parkinson disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1545-7214
Y1  - 2012/02/
AB  - BACKGROUND: : Although the 14-item Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS) is recommended to screen for and measure the severity of apathetic symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD), the psychometric attributes of this scale have not yet been fully evaluated. OBJECTIVE: : The authors examined the reliability, factor structure, and discriminant validity of the SAS in 194 nondemented patients with early untreated PD. DESIGN: : Cross-sectional multicenter population-based study from Western and Southern Norway. MEASUREMENTS: : Standardized rating scales for parkinsonism and neuropsychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: : The SAS showed fair internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.69) and exploratory factor analysis identified two factors: the first factor (24.2% of the variance) represented cognitive-behavioral aspects of apathy (items 1, 2, and 4-8; Cronbach's α = 0.74) and the second factor (15.0% of the variance) a general apathy dimension (items 3 and 9-14; Cronbach's α = 0.52). The correlation between these two factors was low (Spearman's r = 0.19, N = 194, p = 0.008), indicating clinically distinct dimensions, but both factor scores were strongly related to the total SAS score (Spearman's r > 0.6, N = 194, p < 0.0005). Item 3 (insight or self-reflection) showed a negative item-total correlation, and removing this item raised the Cronbach's α of the second factor to 0.70, but did not substantially alter the other results. Both the total score and factor scores of SAS showed fair discriminant validity. CONCLUSIONS: : Although the SAS showed fairly good psychometric properties and the exploratory factor analysis suggested a two-factor solution, the results with this PD sample indicate that item 3 is ambiguous and should be considered removed from the scale.

T1  - Farsi version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory: validity and reliability study among Iranian elderly with dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 1741-203X
Y1  - 2012/02/
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to validate the Farsi version of Neuropsychiatric Inventory (F-NPI), with the aim of promoting clinical assessment and local research on evaluation of neuropsychiatric symptom profiles of individuals with dementia in Iran. METHODS: In this cross-sectional, psychometric study, 100 patients with dementia in the age range of 60–90 years participated. Two trained psychiatrists interviewed the study subjects. Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were used to determine the concurrent validity. Testretest,inter-rater reliability and internal consistency were calculated. Discrimination validity was determined,using a matched control group consisting of 49 participants without dementia. Cronbach’s α and Pearson’ scorrelation coefficients were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.9) was excellent. The inter-rater reliability varied between 0.6 and 0.98 for frequency, severity and total scale of the F-NPI, and test-retest reliability was between 0.4 and 0.96. Concurrent validity varied between 0.3 and 0.9 (P < 0.05). The most prevalent symptom was “apathy” and the least prevalent was “euphoria”. CONCLUSION: The Farsi version of NPI has satisfactory psychometric indexes and is applicable for clinical and study works in Iranian community.

T1  - Validation of the Icelandic version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory with Caregiver Distress (NPI-D)
LA  - eng
SN  - 1502-4725
Y1  - 2012/02/
ET  - 2011/07/20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dementia is a complex and often debilitating illness, presenting with not only wide-ranging cognitive impairment but also neuropsychiatric challenges, which can have diverse consequences in quality of life for both patient and caregiver. AIM: Studying the validity and reliability of an Icelandic translation of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory with Caregiver Distress (NPI-D). METHODS: NPI-D was administered to 38 primary caregivers of dementia patients. The concurrent validity was explored by statistically comparing the NPI-D to the Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Regarding caregiver distress, concurrent validity was established between NPI-D, BEHAVE-AD Global Rating and two other caregiver distress scales. RESULTS: Significant correlation was found when total score on the BEHAVE-AD was compared with total score on the NPI-D. All NPI-D subscales achieved significant correlation with the corresponding BEHAVE-AD subscales apart from the 'depression/dysphoria subscale'. This NPI-D subscale correlated however, significantly with the GDS depression scale, a frequent and well validated measure of depressive symptoms in the elderly population. Cronbach's alpha coefficient indicated a high degree of overall internal consistency among the items of the NPI-D. Interestingly, apathy was the most frequent neuropsychiatric disturbance and the only subscale that differed significantly between dementia severity levels. Finally, when studying caregiver distress, the NPI-D showed good concurrent validity with other measures of caregiver burden and distress. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate an acceptable level of validity and reliability; therefore the Icelandic translation of the NPI-D is well suited for identifying neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia and associated caregiver burden.

ET  - 2011/05/17
AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate memantine effectiveness on behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in clinical practice and to identify variables that may predict the therapy effects. The effects of memantine on behaviour were analysed in the database of a post-marketing surveillance study promoted by the Lombardy Region Health Office and involving 43 Alzheimer's disease (AD) Units. From July to December 2005, 399 moderately severe-to-severe AD patients free of cholinergic medications were enrolled, treated with memantine and followed-up for 6 months. BPSD were assessed in a subgroup of 297 patients [mean age 77 ± 8 years; 73% females; mean neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) score 28 ± 24] for whom the 12-item NPI subscores at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months were available. The 12 BPSD were clustered as follows: affect, physical behaviour, psychosis and hypomania. The main outcome measure was the proportion of individual cluster responders at 6 months of therapy. The proportion of individual cluster responders was 30% affect, 24% physical behaviour, 29% psychosis, 27% hypomania. Patients taking 20 mg memantine daily during the study period had a statistically significant higher probability to experience behavioural improvement than those who discontinued treatment or did not complete memantine titration (affect OR 9.0; 95% CI 3.8-21.6; physical behaviour OR 17.8; 95% CI 5.9-53.6; psychosis OR 23.6; 95% CI 5.1-110.8). The logistic regression analysis was not applicable to the hypomania subsyndrome because of the low cluster prevalence. The standard 20 mg daily memantine treatment regimen was found to be associated with a modest 6-month behavioural improvement in the affect, physical behaviour and psychosis domains in 24-30% of patients.

T1  - Hello, Who is Calling?: Can Words Reveal the Social Nature of Conversations?
LA  - eng
Y1  - 2012
AB  - This study aims to infer the social nature of conversations from their content automatically. To place this work in context, our motivation stems from the need to understand how social disengagement affects cognitive decline or depression among older adults. For this purpose, we collected a comprehensive and naturalistic corpus comprising of all the incoming and outgoing telephone calls from 10 subjects over the duration of a year. As a first step, we learned a binary classifier to filter out business related conversation, achieving an accuracy of about 85%. This classification task provides a convenient tool to probe the nature of telephone conversations. We evaluated the utility of openings and closing in differentiating personal calls, and find that empirical results on a large corpus do not support the hypotheses by Schegloff and Sacks that personal conversations are marked by unique closing structures. For classifying different types of social relationships such as family vs other, we investigated features related to language use (entropy), hand-crafted dictionary (LIWC) and topics learned using unsupervised latent Dirichlet models (LDA). Our results show that the posteriors over topics from LDA provide consistently higher accuracy (60-81%) compared to LIWC or language use features in distinguishing different types of conversations.

T1  - Dimensions of apathy in Parkinson's disease: exploratory factor analysis of the apathy scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 1877-718X
Y1  - 2012
AB  - Apathy, an intrinsic disorder of motivation, can manifest in cognitive, affective, and behavioral domains. Recent attempts to formalize diagnostic criteria for apathy have advocated this triadic structure. The Apathy Scale (AS) is the only recommended measure for assessing apathy in Parkinson's disease (PD) by a Movement Disorders task force. We tested the hypothesis that the AS distinctly measures the three proposed domains of apathy in PD. Participants were 226 non-demented PD patients. Apathy Scale data were examined with exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The three factor solution resembled the triadic structure of cognitive, behavioral, and affective domains; however, adjustments to the AS may be appropriate.

T1  - Comparison of the frontal systems behavior scale and neuropsychological tests of executive functioning in predicting instrumental activities of daily living
LA  - eng
SN  - 2327-9109
Y1  - 2012
AB  - Both neuropsychological tests of executive functioning and the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) consistently predict instrumental activity-of-daily-living capacity. However, the nature of the predictive relationship between the FrSBe and neuropsychological tests of executive functioning has received limited attention. The current study was designed to assess the incremental validity of the FrSBe in predicting instrumental activity-of-daily-living functioning when added to comprehensive testing of executive functioning in a sample of 100 adult general neuropsychological referrals. A composite measure of executive test performance was calculated, and a family member completed the FrSBe and an instrumental activity-of-daily-living measure. Stepwise multiple regression analysis using the executive composite measure and the FrSBe accounted for 44% of the variance in instrumental activity capacity, and the addition of the FrSBe increased predictive ability by approximately 50%. The current results also indicate that FrSBe Scale E is more important as a predictor of instrumental activity capacity than the two self-regulation measures, Scale A and Scale D.

T1  - Farmers' stress and coping in a time of drought
LA  - eng
SN  - 1445-6354
Y1  - 2012
ET  - 2012/10/09
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Farmers as a group have unique attitudes, sources of stress and a heightened risk of suicide. In the context of a prolonged drought and associated stress and increased risk of mental-health problems, this study provides an insight into the levels of psychological distress experienced by different demographic groups within the Australian farming community. The study also addresses a significant gap in the literature by exploring ways in which this unique cohort copes and may better cope, with the inevitable challenges of life 'on the land'. METHODS: A sample of 309 drought-affected South Australian farmers and their spouses (M=51.81, SD=11.69) completed questionnaires containing measures of psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale) and coping (situational version of the COPE) in response to a recent stressor. RESULTS: There was<strong> </strong>no significant difference detected between the levels of distress reported by men and women. Younger farmers (25-54 years) were experiencing significantly higher levels of distress than those in the 55-64 age group but not those aged 65-74 years. The most commonly employed coping strategies were <em>planning</em>, <em>acceptance</em> and <em>active coping</em> and least used were <em>alcohol/drug use</em>, <em>denial</em>, <em>behavioural disengagement</em> and <em>religion</em>. Gender, age-group and the type of stressor (ie farm related, non-farm related, combination) were found to affect farmers' choice of some coping strategies. A multiple regression analysis suggested that behavioural disengagement<em> </em>(&&num;946;=.28, <em>p</em> < .05),<em> suppression of competing activities </em>(&&num;946;= .20, <em>p <</em> .05)<em>, venting </em>(&&num;946;= .18, <em>p</em> < .05)<em>, </em><em>alcohol/drug use </em>(&&num;946;= .18, <em>p < </em>.05)<em>, </em>and <em>mental disengagement </em>(&&num;946;=.12, <em>p </em>< .05) all significantly and positively predicted distress in this population, collectively accounting for 34.6% of the variance. CONCLUSION: This study offers a rare examination of farmers' psychological distress and coping in a time of drought. The results demonstrate that in this unique context it is erroneous to assume the universality of models of coping that have been validated in other samples. The results provide for the development of tailored interventions to help farmers cope more effectively during future times of drought.

AB  - Aim. The objective of our study has been to evaluate the WHO-5 as a new early screening instrument for apathy in a group of elderly persons. Methods. The WHO-5 was compared to the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). The GDS contains five items measuring well-being and ten items measuring depression. The internal validity of the WHO-5 (total score being a sufficient statistic) was evaluated with both parametric and nonparametric item response theory models. The external validity of the WHO-5 and the GDS was evaluated by ROC using depression as index of validity. Results. The item response theory analyses confirmed that the total score of the WHO-5 is a sufficient statistic. The ROC analysis shows an adequate sensitivity (61%) and specificity (84%). The GDS(15) and its two subscales obtained low sensitivity (25-42%), but high specificity (90-98%). Conclusion. The WHO-5 was found both internally and externally valid when considering decreased positive well-being to be an early indication of apathy reflecting that the wind has begun to be taken out of the "motivation sail."

T1  - Post-stroke depression: Main phenomenological clusters and their relationships with clinical measures
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-8584
SN  - 0953-4180
Y1  - 2012
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the principal psychopathological dimensions of post-stroke depression (PSD) through the assessment of the factorial structure of the Post-Stroke Depression Rating Scale (PSDRS). METHODS: We enrolled ninety-eight subjects with PSD, who underwent the PSDRS, MMSE and Barthel Index. Information about demographic, clinical, and neuroanatomical factors was collected. RESULTS: The factor analysis extracted three factors accounting for 63.4% of the total variance, and identified as: 1) "Depressive and Anxious Symptoms" (DAS); 2) "Lack of Emotional Control" (LEC); 3) "Reduced Motivation" (RM). On multivariate statistics, DAS severity was predicted by previous history of mood disorders and Barthel Index; LEC severity was predicted by Barthel Index; RM severity was predicted by age. CONCLUSIONS: The PSDRS displayed a reliable factor structure that agreed with previous interpretation of PSD. In particular, core depressive symptoms seem to be related to premorbid personality and functional status, whereas apathy/anhedonia may be connected to brain aging.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms in older people with and without cognitive impairment
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-8908
Y1  - 2012
AB  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are non-cognitive disturbances such as depression. Rates of NPS have been shown to increase as cognitive ability declines and may be useful in predicting transition from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. This community-based study reports the association between NPS and cognitive decline over two years. Participants included 873 community dwelling adults aged 70-90 years enrolled in the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study. NPS were assessed by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Cognitive impairment was defined by diagnosis (MCI or incident dementia) or neuropsychological test performance across five cognitive domains. Cognitive decline was defined by progression to dementia or worse neuropsychological performance. Total NPS at baseline did not differ between those without cognitive impairment (26.2%) and those with MCI (28.8%), but agitation and apathy were associated with MCI. Only baseline depression was associated with dementia at follow-up. Total NPS at baseline was cross-sectionally associated with cognitive impairment in executive function, attention, and global cognition, but did not predict cognitive decline. Depression, anxiety, agitation, anxiety, and apathy were all associated with impairment in at least one cognitive domain, but only anxiety and agitation were significantly associated with cognitive decline. Sensitivity analyses applied more stringent criteria for NPS and cognitive impairment in MCI but did not alter interpretation of results from the main analysis. Overall rates of NPS at baseline were not associated with MCI, dementia, or cognitive decline over two years. Additional follow-up is needed to further examine this association over a longer time course.

T1  - Effect of six months of treatment with V0191 in patients with suspected prodromal Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1875-8908
Y1  - 2012
AB  - New criteria related to prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been proposed to overcome the issue of heterogeneity of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to better define patients in early stage AD. Only few therapeutic trials, if any, have been reported using this newly defined population. The objective of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of a novel pro-cholinergic drug (V0191) in patients with prodromal AD. Two hundred forty two (242) patients with a diagnosis of prodromal AD were randomized in an approximately 1 : 1 ratio to receive either 1500 mg V0191 or matching placebo once daily for 24 weeks. Changes in global cognitive functioning were assessed using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog; responder rate as primary efficacy measure). Standardized measures of memory, executive function, attention, functional capacity, and apathy were also obtained. Despite some interesting trends at week 12 and conversion rates favoring V0191, no statistically significant differences in cognitive function between V0191 and placebo were noted. In addition to the absence of drug efficacy on this population, several design features may have hindered this study, including insufficient powering to assess changes in cognition over time, a relatively short duration of treatment, and the lack of validated clinical trial measures designed to assess the prodromal AD population. Lessons learned in AD study design optimization, including those presented in this paper, could be valuable for further investigation with pro-cholinergic drugs such as V0191.

ET  - 2011/09/14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although non-motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease are common and can cause severe disability, they are often under-recognized, leading to missed treatment opportunities. Screening tools for non-motor symptoms are urgently needed. Recently a 30-item screening Non Motor Symptoms Questionnaire was developed. Although some psychometric properties have been evaluated, sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaire have not been systematically assessed. METHODS: Parkinson patients completed Non Motor Symptoms Questionnaire, then underwent a gold-standard clinical evaluation of non-motor symptoms and signs that included extensive standardized questionnaires, cognitive/behavioural assessment, and neurological examination to determine whether each manifestation was present or absent. The sensitivity and specificity of each non-motor symptom, in relation to the gold-standard were estimated. RESULTS: For the 70 participants, the mean age was 66.7+/-9.3, 64% were men, and disease duration was 3.8+/-2.8 years. From the gold-standard evaluation, the prevalence of non-motor manifestations ranged from 8.7% (hallucinations) to 78.3% (nocturia). The mean sensitivity of all Non Motor Symptoms was 63.4%. This varied considerably among different manifestations, ranging from 24% (sleepiness, hyposmia) to 100% (diplopia). By restricting analysis to clinically significant non-motor problems (i.e. those serious enough to warrant treatment), the mean sensitivity increased to 71.8%. The specificity for most items was high, with an overall mean specificity of 88.5%. CONCLUSIONS: For many non-motor manifestations Non Motor Symptoms Questionnaire is an effective screen; however, for manifestations such as somnolence, olfactory loss and apathy, sensitivity is suboptimal. Overall, this questionnaire can be a useful clinical tool for screening non-motor problems in an office setting.

T1  - Validation of the MDS-UPDRS Part I for nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1531-8257
Y1  - 2012/01/
ET  - 2011/09/13
AB  - The UPDRS has been the main outcome measure in studies of PD. Modifications have been made to improve scale properties and represent the breadth of manifestations of PD, particularly nonmotor symptoms (NMS), resulting in the Movement Disorder Society's revision of the UPDRS (MDS-UPDRS). This study was undertaken to determine the validity of MDS-UPDRS Part I (nonmotor experiences of daily living). The MDS-UPDRS and a number of validated scales for the NMS in PD were used in 94 patients with PD from Hoehn and Yahr stage I to V. We assessed reliability, floor and ceiling effects, and correlations with validated scales for the nonmotor symptoms of PD. MDS-UPDRS Part I showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.85), small floor and ceiling effects (2% floor and 0% ceiling effect), and good concurrent validity (correlation with the original UPDRS Part I: r = 0.81, P < 0.001). The standardized z-score of the MDS-UPDRS Part I score demonstrated high convergent validity with the composite z-score of nonmotor scales (r = 0.89, P < 0.0001), and the two subscores based on the original factor analysis of Part I also had high correlations with the composite z-scores of corresponding nonmotor scales (depression, anxiety, apathy factor score: r = 0.72, P < 0.0001; other nonmotor features factor score: r = 0.87, P < 0.0001). Our data demonstrate that the MDS-UPDRS Part I total score has a strong relationship with a composite score of validated scales for the nonmotor aspects of PD.

T1  - The SEA (Social cognition and Emotional Assessment): a clinical neuropsychological tool for early diagnosis of frontal variant of frontotemporal lobar degeneration
LA  - eng
SN  - 1931-1559
Y1  - 2012/01/
ET  - 2011/09/05
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The frontal variant of frontotemporal degeneration (fvFTD) is characterized by a predominant behavioral syndrome, which is mostly attributable to an orbital-medial prefrontal dysfunction. The orbital and ventral medial prefrontal functions in humans are difficult to assess in clinical practice. Here, we propose a new tool, the SEA (Social cognition and Emotional Assessment), for use in evaluating the functions of the orbital and ventral-medial portions of the prefrontal cortex. METHOD: The SEA is composed of five subtests, each assessing a specific orbitofrontal-related function: a test of identification of facial emotions, a reversal/extinction task, a behavioral control task, a theory of mind test, and an apathy scale. The maximum score is 55. Three groups have been tested: 22 fvFTD patients, 22 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 30 healthy control subjects, all matched for age and educational level. RESULTS: FvFTD patients showed significantly lower performances in all subtests of the SEA. A cut-off score of 39.4/55 was proposed to separate normal controls from fvFTD patients, with a maximum sensitivity and specificity of 100%. A very high specificity (88.5%) was obtained using the same cut-off with AD/aMCI patients and normal controls versus fvFTD patients. FvFTD patients' performance in the SEA did not correlate with any other neuropsychological scores, particularly the classical cognitive executive tests. CONCLUSIONS: The SEA is a new and useful tool for diagnosing fvFTD and, more generally, all of the diseases affecting the orbital and medial prefrontal functions.

T1  - Clinical benefit of gluten-free diet in screen-detected older celiac disease patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 1471-230X
Y1  - 2011/12/16
AB  - BACKGROUND: The utility of serologic screening for celiac disease is still debatable. Evidence suggests that the disorder remains undetected even in the older population. It remains obscure whether screening makes good or harm in subjects with long-standing gluten ingestion. We evaluated whether older subjects benefit from active detection and subsequent gluten free dietary treatment of celiac disease. METHODS: Thirty-five biopsy-proven patients aged over 50 years had been detected by serologic mass screening. We examined the disease history, dietary compliance, symptoms, quality of life and bone mineral density at baseline and 1-2 years after the commencement of a gluten-free diet. Symptoms were evaluated by gastrointestinal symptom rating scale and quality of life by psychological general well-being questionnaires. Small bowel biopsy, serology, laboratory parameters assessing malabsorption, and bone mineral density were investigated. RESULTS: Dietary compliance was good. The patients had initially low mean serum ferritin values indicating subclinical iron deficiency, which was restored by a gluten-free diet. Vitamin B12, vitamin D and erythrocyte folic acid levels increased significantly on diet. Celiac patients had a history of low-energy fractures more often than the background population, and the diet had a beneficial effect on bone mineral density. Alleviation in gastrointestinal symptoms was observed, even though the patients reported no or only subtle symptoms at diagnosis. Quality of life remained unchanged. Of all the cases, two thirds would have been diagnosed even without screening if the family history, fractures or concomitant autoimmune diseases had been taken carefully into account. CONCLUSIONS: Screen-detected patients benefited from a gluten-free diet. We encourage a high index of suspicion and active case-finding in celiac disease as an alternative to mass screening in older patients.

T1  - Development of a patient reported outcome measure for fatigue in motor neurone disease: the Neurological Fatigue Index (NFI-MND)
LA  - eng
SN  - 1477-7525
Y1  - 2011/11/22
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this research was to develop a disease-specific measure for fatigue in patients with motor neurone disease (MND) by generating data that would fit the Rasch measurement model. Fatigue was defined as reversible motor weakness and whole-body tiredness that was predominantly brought on by muscular exertion and was partially relieved by rest. METHODS: Qualitative interviews were undertaken to confirm the suitability of a previously identified set of 52 neurological fatigue items as relevant to patients with MND. Patients were recruited from five U.K. MND clinics. Questionnaires were administered during clinic or by post. A sub-sample of patients completed the questionnaire again after 2-4 weeks to assess test-retest validity. Exploratory factor analyses and Rasch analysis were conducted on the item set. RESULTS: Qualitative interviews with ten MND patients confirmed the suitability of 52 previously identified neurological fatigue items as relevant to patients with MND. 298 patients consented to completing the initial questionnaire including this item set, with an additional 78 patients completing the questionnaire a second time after 4-6 weeks. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified five potential subscales that could be conceptualised as representing: 'Energy', 'Reversible muscular weakness' (shortened to 'Weakness'), 'Concentration', 'Effects of heat' and 'Rest'. Of the original five factors, two factors 'Energy' and 'Weakness' met the expectations of the Rasch model. A higher order fatigue summary scale, consisting of items from the 'Energy' and 'Weakness' subscales, was found to fit the Rasch model and have acceptable unidimensionality. The two scales and the higher order summary scale were shown to fulfil model expectations, including assumptions of unidimensionality, local independency and an absence of differential item functioning. CONCLUSIONS: The Neurological Fatigue Index for MND (NFI-MND) is a simple, easy-to-administer fatigue scale. It consists of an 8-item fatigue summary scale in addition to separate scales for measuring fatigue experienced as reversible muscular weakness and fatigue expressed as feelings of low energy and whole body tiredness. The underlying two factor structure supports the patient concept of fatigue derived from qualitative interviews in this population. All three scales were shown to be reliable and capable of interval level measurement.

T1  - Differential effects of deep TMS of the prefrontal cortex on apathy and depression
LA  - eng
SN  - 1876-4754
Y1  - 2011/10/
ET  - 2011/01/22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is one hallmark of major depression (MDD). It is distinguished by lack of emotion, whereas other aspects of depression involve considerable emotional distress. Investigating both apathy and depression may increase the degree of treatment efficacy for both ailments together and apart. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the differential effects of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) on apathy and other aspects of depression in patients suffering from a depressive episode. METHODS: Fifty-four treatment-resistant MDD patients were evaluated with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), and then treated with DTMS. Apathy-related items from HRSD (ApHRSD) were compared with the remaining items from HRSD (DepHRSD). Antidepressant medications were withdrawn and active DTMS treatment was administered at 20 Hz, 5 days a week for 4 weeks. Changes in HRSD were recorded. Primary efficacy time point was 1 week after the end of active treatment. RESULTS: At screening, ApHRSD distribution was unimodal (moderate apathy), with low correlation (r = 0.17) between ApHRSD and DepHRSD. After treatment, a third had remitted apathy, and the correlation between ApHRSD and DepHRSD had dramatically increased (r = 0.83). Severe ApHRSD (≥ 7) at screening correlated with nonremission for both ApHRSD (R(2) = 0.1993, P = .0012) and DepHRSD (R(2) = 0.0860, P = .0334). CONCLUSIONS: DTMS over the PFC improved both apathy and depression similarly. However, DTMS did not lead to MDD remission if ApHRSD at screening was ≥ 7 of 12. Further investigation using a larger sample will determine whether screening apathy at baseline could be used to predict efficacy of DTMS in MDD patients.

T1  - Post-stroke fatigue
LA  - eng
SN  - 0353-9466
Y1  - 2011/09/
AB  - Post-stroke fatigue is still a relatively unexplored, often neglected condition. The fatigue often manifests as physical and mental lack of energy, and many patients mention fatigue as one of the most difficult sequels to which they have to adjust. Our aim was to assess the fatigue in 35 three-month post-stroke patients and its relation to personal and stroke-related factors, and to compare them with 35 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. The main outcome measures for the fatigue were Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20). Barthel index was used for functional status assessment, while anxiety and depressive symptoms were evaluated using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Study results showed fatigue to be frequent (45%) and often severe. Post-stroke patients showed higher values of general fatigue dimensions, physical fatigue and reduced activity. The number of subjects reporting fatigue problems on the FSS and MFI-20 scales was significantly greater in the stroke group (16/35; 45%) than in the control group (4/35; 11%; chi2 = 12.5; P < 0.001). Considering associations between fatigue and Barthel index score, age, sex, HADS-A (anxiety) and HADS-D (depression) scores, statistically significant associations were recorded between fatigue and anxiety (P = 0.01) and depression symptoms (P = 0.02). Global fatigue showed positive correlation with Barthel index score too (P = 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that anxiety and depression symptoms could predict post-stroke fatigue (adjusted R2 = 0.556; P < 0.05). Clinical trials and follow-up studies to find an effective treatment for patients with post-stroke fatigue are warranted.

T1  - Dementia with Lewy bodies is associated with higher scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale than is Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1479-8301
Y1  - 2011/09/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several reports suggest a higher morbidity of depression in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) than in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, these results have not been duplicated consistently. The psychiatric symptoms of dementia, including depression, are important for its diagnosis and management. Thus, the aim of the present study was to clarify the characteristics of the depressive symptoms in DLB compared with AD using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). METHODS: We examined the GDS score for 86 patients with probable DLB (based on the Consensus Criteria for the clinical diagnosis of DLB) and 86 patients with probable AD (based on criteria of the National Institute for Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association), who were matched according to age, sex, education, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. We also examined correlations between GDS scores and age, sex, or MMSE scores in both groups. Correlations between GDS scores and metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy were examined in patients with DLB. To characterize the GDS in DLB, its profile was examined using factor structures. RESULTS: Scores for DLB patients were twice as high on the GDS as those for AD patients. There was no correlation between GDS score and age, sex, or MMSE scores in either group. Furthermore, there was no correlation between the results of MIBG scintigraphy and GDS scores in the DLB group. Using factor structures, the depression symptom profile of these diseases suggested that depression-specific symptoms, such as mood, worry, or future outlook, were more frequent in the DLB group than non-specific symptoms, such as lack of energy, decreased concentration, or apathy. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that depressive symptoms are highly specific symptoms of DLB, independent of other features of this disorder. The GDS could be used as a subsidiary tool in differentiating DLB from AD and is more useful than clinical observations of depression.

T1  - Depression in Alzheimer's disease: specificity of depressive symptoms using three different clinical criteria
LA  - eng
SN  - 1099-1166
Y1  - 2011/09/
ET  - 2010/12/07
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies report contradictory results on whether the symptoms of depression in Alzheimer's disease patients are the same as in cognitively normal persons. Thus, provisional criteria for depression in Alzheimer's disease (PDC-dAD) have been developed. AIM: To examine which symptoms in AD patients are significant in diagnosing depression according to PDC-dAD compared to those for the DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 criteria. METHODS: We included 112 patients with Alzheimer's disease. They were interviewed by a psychiatrist who diagnosed depression according to PDC-dAD, DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10. Without knowledge of that diagnosis, trained nurses interviewed the caregivers of the patients using the Cornell scale for depression in dementia (CSDD). RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 83.0 (s.d. 7.9), 77 (69.6%) were female. The proportion with depression according to each set of criteria was: PDC-dAD 53.5%, ICD-10, 47.3% and DSM-IV-TR, 34.8%. Sadness, loss of interest and agitation/retardation were the most prevalent symptoms in depressed subjects as evaluated by the psychiatrists. According to CSDD sadness, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, poor self-esteem, multiple physical complaints and pessimism best distinguished the depressed patients from the non-depressed. In multiple logistic regression analyses poor self-esteem, delusion and multiple physical complaints best predicted depression using PDC-dAD criteria, whereas sadness, suicidal thoughts and poor self-esteem best predicted depression using ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR. CONCLUSION: The most significant symptoms for a depressive disorder in AD are pretty much the same as for patients without dementia using the DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 criteria, whereas they differ using the PDC-dAD criteria.

T1  - Suicide from the perspectives of older men who experience depression: a gender analysis
LA  - eng
SN  - 1557-9891
Y1  - 2011/09/
ET  - 2011/08/03
AB  - Depression can be a pathway to older men's suicide, yet the mechanisms by which this can occur are poorly understood. A qualitative study of 22 older men who self-identified or were formally diagnosed with depression was conducted to describe the connections between masculinity, depression, and suicide. Analyses of individual interviews revealed that cumulative losses around social bonds were central to older men's depression, apathy for living, and thoughts about suicide. Prominent were men's self-assessments of failing to fulfill breadwinner roles, judgments that led participants to ruminate on their shortcomings amid recognizing their older age as limiting opportunities for redemption. Stigma featured as a barrier for men acting on their suicidal thoughts, and guilt about the pain their suicide would evoke on family and friends was a strong deterrent for men's self-harm. Overall, participants' alignment to masculine ideals influenced both the connectedness and detachment between older men's depression and suicide.

T1  - Midlife motivational abilities predict apathy and depression in Alzheimer disease: the aging, demographics, and memory study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1552-5708
Y1  - 2011/09/
ET  - 2011/06/01
AB  - Apathy and depression are the most common neuropsychiatric symptoms in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD). This study was the first to explore midlife motivational abilities as a predictor of the progression of apathy and depression in MCI and AD. It used a subsample of the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (N = 137). Participants, aged over 70, were categorized according to baseline clinical diagnosis (normal cognition, MCI, or AD). Assessments were conducted at an 18-month interval. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Midlife motivational abilities were estimated on the basis of the main occupation using the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) database, which provides detailed information on worker abilities. Repeated measures analysis of covariance was used. Apathy and depression were found to be particularly high in participants with AD and high motivational abilities. Apathy, but not depression, increased over time in those with AD and high motivational abilities. It would appear that holding on to unattainable goals with strong motivational efforts when faced with severe cognitive loss might lead to unproductive persistence, depressive reaction, and more apathetic behavior.

AB  - Hyposmia, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive problems are common nonmotor manifestations in Parkinson's disease, but how they are related remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between olfactory dysfunction and neuropsychiatric manifestations and performed a cross-sectional study of 248 patients at two movement disorders clinics at academic medical centers. Psychiatric measures were the Geriatric Depression Scale-15, Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, State Anxiety Inventory, Apathy Scale, and Parkinson's Psychosis Rating Scale. Cognitive measures were the Mini-Mental State Examination, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Digit Span, Tower of London-Drexel, and the Stroop Color Word Test. Olfaction was tested with the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. There was no significant association between olfaction and mood measures, but psychotic symptoms were more common in patients with olfaction scores below the median (30% vs. 12%; P < 0.001). Worse olfaction was associated with poorer memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised delayed recall items: mean [standard deviation], 6.2 [3.2] vs. 8.4 [2.8]; P < 0.001) and executive performance (Tower of London total moves, 52 [38] vs. 34 [21]; P < 0.001). Odor-identification score was a significant predictor of abnormal performance on these cognitive tests after adjustment for age, sex, and disease characteristics in logistic regression models. The relationship between hyposmia, psychosis, and specific cognitive impairments may reflect the anatomic distribution of Lewy pathology and suggests that olfactory dysfunction could be a biomarker of additional extranigral disease. Future prospective studies are warranted to assess whether hyposmia, a very early feature of Parkinson's disease, might be used to predict the appearance of other common nonmotor symptoms.

T1  - Predictors of depression among older people living in rural areas of Thailand
LA  - eng
SN  - 0377-9238
Y1  - 2011/08/
AB  - Global population is ageing and Thailand has one of the fastest growing ageing populations in this region. Combined with this, depression has become a major mental health problem for older people. The objective of this paper is to examine the predictors of depression among rural older people of Thailand. This study has used information from the Study on Health and Social Support among Older Population living in Kanchanaburi Demographic Surveillance System (KDSS), Thailand in 2006. Depression was measured by a 12 item questionnaire of Thai validated Euro-D scale among 1001 respondents. The questions were on depression, pessimism, wishing to die, guilt, sleep disturbance, loss of interest, irritability, eating problems, fatigue, problem in concentration, lack of enjoyment, and tearfulness. Among the respondents 28.5% had depression. The results of logistic regression found that infirmity, disability and serious life events had significant effect on depression of the respondent. Those who had 4 or more infirmity, they were 2.08 times more likely to have depression compare to those who had no or only 1 infirmity. Disability was another strong predictor of the depression. It should be mentioned here that those who had medium disability, had the chance of depression 3.12 times more compare to those who had no disability. Serious life event was also a major factor for the respondents. Those who had 3 or more serious life events they had the depression 5.25 times more compare to those who had no serious life event.This study identified three major predictors of depression for older people in KDSS, Thailand. The finding will help to design specific prevention program to reduce the depression of older people living in the rural area of Thailand.

T1  - Psychometric properties of the Spanish QoL-AD with institutionalized dementia patients and their family caregivers in Spain
LA  - eng
SN  - 1364-6915
Y1  - 2011/08/
ET  - 2011/05/24
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the psychometric attributes of the Spanish version of the Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QoL-AD) in institutionalized patients and family caregivers in Spain. METHOD: 101 patients (88.1% women; mean age, 83.2  ±  6.3) with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 82) and mixed dementia (n = 19) and their closest family caregivers. Patient-related variables included severity of dementia, cognitive status, perceived general health, quality of life, behavior, apathy, depression, and functional status. QoL-AD acceptability, reliability, and construct validity were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 7.2  ±  6.1 and Global Deterioration Scale was: stage four (4%); five (21.2%); six (34.3%); and seven (40.4%). Both, QoL-AD patient version (QoL-ADp) (n = 40; MMSE = 12.0  ±  4.5) and QoL-AD caregiver version (QoL-ADc) (n = 101) lacked significant floor and ceiling effects and the Cronbach α index was 0.90 and 0.86, respectively. The corrected item-total correlation was 0.11-0.68 (QoL-ADc) and 0.28-0.84 (QoL-ADp). Stability was satisfactory for QoL-ADp (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=0.83) but low for QoL-ADc (ICC = 0.51); the standard error of measurement was 2.72 and 4.69. Construct validity was moderate/high for QoL-ADc (QUALID=-0.43; EQ-5D = 0.65), but lower for QoL-ADp. No significant correlations were observed between QoL-ADp and patient variables or QoL-ADc. A low to high association (r = 0.18-0.55) was obtained between QoL-ADc and patient-related measures of neuropsychiatric, function, and cognitive status. CONCLUSION: Differences in their psychometric attributes, and discrepancy between them, were found for QoL-ADp and QoL-ADc. In patients with AD and advanced dementia, the QoL perceived by the patient could be based on a construct that is different from the traditional QoL construct.

T1  - Do the GDS and the GDS-15 adequately capture the range of depressive symptoms among older residents in congregate housing?
LA  - eng
SN  - 1741-203X
Y1  - 2011/08/
ET  - 2011/01/27
AB  - BACKGROUND: In light of inconsistencies in cut points for identifying non-major depression, this study examined the classification efficiency of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS and GDS-15) total scores and individual items, and four additional depressive symptoms for identification of subthreshold, minor, or criterion depression among 166 vulnerable residents of congregate housing. METHODS: Depression (combined categories of major depressive episode, minor, or subthreshold depression) was determined by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) diagnostic interview depression module administered by telephone to 166 older residents of congregate housing facilities who also completed the 30-item GDS and four other yes/no potential indicators of geriatric depression. Classification agreement and ROC curve analysis for the full and 15-item GDS scale scores were calculated. Individual item hit rates for MINI criterion were calculated for GDS items and four new items. RESULTS: GDS and GDS-15 at standard cut points had 70-75% agreement with MINI. Best sensitivity and specificity were obtained at lower than standard cut points. Some GDS Withdrawal, Apathy, lack of Vigor (WAV) and cognitive items obtained very low hit rates. New items "I just don't feel like myself" and "I feel I am a burden to others" better discriminated MINI depression than most GDS items and had good item-to-total correlations with the GDS. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic criteria and GDS screen had partial agreement. Some GDS items did not adequately represent depression among functionally impaired or oldest old older adults. Feeling one is a burden and the sense of feeling "different" from usual may be useful indicators of depression among vulnerable older adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe, in a Mexican sample of urban and rural residents older than 65 years, with and without dementia, the frequency and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This work is part of the multi-center, epidemiological study carried out by the 10/66 Dementia Research Group, with 1,003 subjects from an urban region and 1,000 subjects from a rural region. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed with the abbreviated version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Q). RESULTS: Eighty six and eighty five dementia cases were found in the urban and rural regions, respectively. Subjects with dementia were more frequently widows, older and less educated, and the ones from the rural region had fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms, compared to the urban region. In both regions all symptoms were more severe in subjects with dementia. A high frequency of affective symptoms (depression and apathy specially) was observed, and irritability and anxiety in second term. The caregiver stress levels were associated with the frequency and severity of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with dementia identified by means of culturally validated and population based diagnostic criteria, in Mexican residents of urban and rural settings.

T1  - Burnout levels and self-rated health prospectively predict future long-term sickness absence: a study among female health professionals
LA  - eng
SN  - 1536-5948
Y1  - 2011/07/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the predictive validity of the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), and of three health indicators (depression, anxiety, and self-rated health), for long-term sickness absence (LTSA). METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to all employees in a Swedish County Council (N = 6118), and the overall response rate was 65% (N = 3976). As 82% were women, only women were included in the study. Certified LTSA data were collected. RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses showed that high scores on exhaustion, depression, and poor self-rated health increased the risk of future LTSA (≥90 days). Support for the proposed two-factorial structure of the OLBI was found, including the dimensions of exhaustion and disengagement from work. CONCLUSION: Using burnout measures might be useful to identify those at risk for LTSA, and to enable preventive solutions in organizations.

T1  - General and disease-specific quality of life in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media--a prospective study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1477-7525
Y1  - 2011/06/29
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is frequently associated with symptoms of inflammation like discharge from the ear or pain. In many cases, patients suffer from hearing loss causing communication problems and social withdrawal. The objective of this work was to collect prospective audiological data and data on general and disease-specific quality of life with validated quality of life measurement instruments to assess the impact of the disease on health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). METHODS: 121 patients were included in the study. Patients were clinically examined in the hospital before and 6 months after surgery including audiological testing. They filled in the quality of life questionnaires SF-36 and Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 (COMOT-15) pre-operatively and 6 and 12 months post-operatively, respectively. RESULTS: Complete data records from 90 patients were available for statistical analysis. Disease-specific HR-QOL in patients with CSOM improved after tympanoplasty in all the scales of the COMOT-15. There was no difference in HR-QOL assessment between patients with mesotympanic respectively epitympanic CSOM. However, we did find the outcome to be worse in patients who received revision surgery compared with those receiving primary surgery. Audiometric findings correlated very well with the subscale hearing function from the COMOT-15 questionnaire. General HR-QOL measured with the SF-36 was not significantly changed by tympanoplasty. CONCLUSIONS: Tympanoplasty did lead to a significant improvement of disease-specific HR-QOL in patients with CSOM while general HR-QOL did not change. Very well correlations were found between the subscale hearing function from the COMOT-15 questionnaire and audiological findings. Revision surgery seems to be a predictor for a worse outcome.

T1  - Concise Associated Symptoms Tracking scale: a brief self-report and clinician rating of symptoms associated with suicidality
LA  - eng
SN  - 1555-2101
Y1  - 2011/06/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warnings recommend monitoring negative symptoms associated with the initiation of antidepressant medications as these symptoms may interfere with full recovery and pose safety concerns. There is currently no brief, reliable rating instrument for assessing treatment-emergent, negative symptoms. We evaluated the psychometric properties of 2 versions of the newly developed 17-item Concise Associated Symptom Tracking (CAST) scale, the CAST Clinician Rating (CAST-C) and CAST Self-Rated (CAST-SR), which are brief instruments designed to measure the 5 relevant associated symptom domains (irritability, anxiety, mania, insomnia, and panic). METHOD: The study enrolled 265 outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD), from July 2007 through February 2008, into an 8-week, open-label trial with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Diagnosis of MDD was determined by the Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening questionnaire and an MDD checklist based on DSM-IV-TR criteria. Suicidality (suicidal ideation with associated behaviors) is 1 of 9 symptoms of MDD (depressed mood, loss of interest, appetite or weight change, sleep disturbance, reduced concentration or indecisiveness, fatigue or decreased energy, psychomotor agitation or retardation, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt). Psychometric evaluations were conducted on both versions of the CAST. RESULTS: Cronbach α was .80 (CAST-C) and .81 (CAST-SR). Factor analysis identified 5 factors for each scale: (1) irritability, (2) anxiety, (3) mania, (4) insomnia, and (5) panic. When the item that cross-loaded on 2 factors was eliminated, the 16-item solution had a better goodness of fit (CAST-C: 0.90 vs 0.87; CAST-SR: 0.88 vs 0.84). Cronbach α for the 16-item versions was .77 (CAST-C) and .78 (CAST-SR). The 5 associated CAST symptom domains correlated well with other standard measures of these domains. CONCLUSIONS: The 16-item CAST-C and CAST-SR demonstrated excellent psychometric properties. These are potentially useful measures for monitoring treatment-emergent negative symptoms associated with antidepressants, as recommended by the FDA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00532103.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Research on the deficits derived from alterations in the prefrontal circuits has been conducted almost exclusively from a categorical perspective, which differentiates normal from pathological functioning. The functioning of the prefrontal cortex, however, can be seen as a continuous dimension. The Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX) was created with the intention of being useful as a qualitative measure of the symptoms of 'dysexecutive syndrome' in day-to-day life. AIM. To explore the psychometric properties of the self-reported DEX in a broad sample of the non-clinical population with a view to providing interpretations that can be of use in clinical practice. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The Spanish version of the DEX was administered to 1013 non-clinical individuals living in Madrid, Saragossa, Asturias, Navarre and Seville (380 males and 633 females). RESULTS: The factorial study conducted in parallel reveals the existence of two factors with adequate consistency and internal validity indices: items that explore difficulties in beginning, maintaining and organising behaviour (disorganisation/apathy) and items related with the interruption of behaviour in situations where it is inappropriate (disinhibition/impulsivity). The distribution according to age matches the developmental premises. The following cut-off points are proposed: < 10, optimal functioning; 10-18, sub-optimal functioning within normality; 19-28, moderately dysexecutive functioning that requires identification of the possible causes, and > 28, important degree of dysexecutive disorder that would include severe pathologies. CONCLUSIONS: The DEX may be useful as an instrument for detecting subjects with demonstrable brain disorders and those with deficient executive functioning without the presence of any known or identifiable pathology.

T1  - Assessment of social anxiety in first episode psychosis using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety scale as a self-report measure
LA  - eng
SN  - 1778-3585
Y1  - 2011/03/
ET  - 2010/10/30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social anxiety is a common problem in psychotic disorders. The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, Self-Rating version (LSAS-SR) is a widely used instrument to capture different aspects of social anxiety, but its psychometric properties have not been tested in this patient group. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the psychometric properties of the LSAS-SR in patients with first episode psychosis, to investigate whether it differentiated between active and passive social withdrawal and to test which clinical factors contributed to current level of social anxiety. METHOD: A total of 144 first episode psychosis patients from the ongoing Thematically Organized Psychosis (TOP) study were included at the time of first treatment. Diagnoses were set according to the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID-1) for DSM-IV. A factor analysis was carried out and the relationship of social anxiety to psychotic and general symptomatology measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was evaluated. Possible contributors to social anxiety were analyzed using multiple hierarchic regression analysis. RESULTS: The factor analysis identified three subscales: public performance, social interaction and observation. All three subscales showed satisfactory psychometric properties, acceptable convergent and discriminate properties, and confirmed previous findings in social anxiety samples. Self-esteem explained a significant amount of the variance in social anxiety, even after adjusting for the effects of delusions, suspiciousness and depression. CONCLUSION: The study shows that the LSAS-SR can be used in this patient group, that social anxiety is strongly related to both behavioral social avoidance and to self-esteem. The results support the use of this measure in assessment of social anxiety in both clinical settings and in research.

T1  - Predicting functional decline in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia

AB  - Behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia is characterized by a change in comportment. It is associated with considerable functional decline over the course of the illness albeit with sometimes dramatic variability among patients. It is unknown whether any baseline features, or combination of features, could predict rate of functional decline in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different baseline clinical, neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, genetic and anatomic predictors on the rate of functional decline as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes scale. We identified 86 subjects with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia that had multiple serial Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes assessments (mean 4, range 2-18). Atlas-based parcellation was used to generate volumes for specific regions of interest at baseline. Volumes were utilized to classify subjects into different anatomical subtypes using the advanced statistical technique of cluster analysis and were assessed as predictor variables. Composite scores were generated for the neuropsychological domains of executive, language, memory and visuospatial function. Behaviours from the brief questionnaire form of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory were assessed. Linear mixed-effects regression modelling was used to determine which baseline features predict rate of future functional decline. Rates of functional decline differed across the anatomical subtypes of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, with faster rates observed in the frontal dominant and frontotemporal subtypes. In addition, subjects with poorer performance on neuropsychological tests of executive, language and visuospatial function, less disinhibition, agitation/aggression and night-time behaviours at presentation, and smaller medial, lateral and orbital frontal lobe volumes showed faster rates of decline. In many instances, the effect of the predictor variables observed across all subjects was also preserved within anatomical subtypes. Furthermore, some of the predictor variables improved our prediction of rate of functional decline after anatomical subtype was taken into account. In particular, age at onset was a highly significant predictor but only after adjusting for subtype. We also found that although some predictor variables, for example gender, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and apathy/indifference, did not affect the rate of functional decline; these variables were associated with the actual Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes score estimated for any given time-point. These findings suggest that in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, rate of functional decline is driven by the combination of anatomical pattern of atrophy, age at onset, and neuropsychiatric characteristics of the subject at baseline.

LA  - eng
SN  - 1552-6887
Y1  - 2011/02/
ET  - 2010/09/27
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current study examined how goal engagement and two coping strategies (self-blame and denial) hypothesized to prevent successful disengagement relate to affective well-being among adults with a functional disability. METHOD: Ninety-nine community-dwelling adults (23 to 76 years old, 66 men) with spinal cord injury participated in structured interviews assessing affective well-being using the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988); goal engagement using a modified version of the Optimization, Primary, and Secondary Control Scale (Heckhausen, Schulz, & Wrosch, 1998); and self-blame and denial using items from Carver's (1997) Brief COPE Inventory. RESULTS: Greater goal engagement was significantly associated with positive but not negative affect. Greater use of self-blame and denial coping was associated with lower positive affect for older adults and higher negative affect across the age range.

T1  - Diagnostic criteria for apathy in clinical practice
LA  - eng
SN  - 1099-1166
Y1  - 2011/02/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is an important and distressing behavioural symptom in Alzheimer's disease and in various neuropsychiatric disorders. Recently, diagnostic criteria for apathy have been proposed. OBJECTIVES: In groups of patients suffering from different neuropsychiatric diseases, (i) to estimate the prevalence of patients meeting the proposed diagnostic criteria; (ii) to estimate the concurrent validity of the criteria with the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) apathy item; (iii) to identify the most frequently met criteria or sub-criteria in each specific neuropsychiatric disease and (iv) to estimate the inter-observer reliability of the diagnostic criteria for apathy. METHODS: This cross-sectional, multicentric, observational study was performed on 306 patients. Each of the participating centres had to check the presence of apathy according to the diagnostic criteria for apathy in consecutive patients belonging to the following diagnoses list: Alzheimer disease (AD), mixed dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Parkinson's disease (PD), Schizophrenia (DSM-IV) and major depressive episode. In addition to the clinical interview, the assessment included the Mini Mental Score Examination (MMSE) and the NPI. At the end of the visit, clinicians were required to check the diagnostic criteria for apathy. RESULTS: Using the diagnostic criteria for apathy, the frequency of apathy was of 53% in the whole population, 55% in AD, 70% in mixed dementia, 43% in MCI, 27% in PD, 53% in schizophrenia and 94% in major depressive episode. In AD, mixed dementia, MCI and PD, the NPI apathy score was significantly higher for patient fulfilling the apathy criteria. Goal-directed cognitive activity (criteria B2-Cognition) was the most frequently observed domain followed by goal-directed behaviour (criteria B1-Behaviour) and emotion (criteria B3), respectively. Inter-rater reliability was high for the overall diagnostic (κ coefficient = 0.93; p = 0.0001) and for each criteria. CONCLUSION: This study is the first one to test the diagnostic criteria for apathy in clinical practice. Results make the diagnostic criteria useful for clinical practice and research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease(PD) is a multidimensional disorder characterized primarily by motor symptoms, but often accompanied by non-motor symptoms, including psychopathological and autonomic symptoms. AIM: To provide an overview of current knowledge concerning the diagnosis, assessment and epidemiology of a number of psychopathological syndromes in PD. METHODS: Relevant literature is discussed. RESULTS: Depressive disorders, apathy, anxiety, cognitive impairment and hallucinations are all common in PD . For most of these syndromes, there is consensus regarding diagnostic criteria, and reliable rating scales are available. In general, an inclusive approach is recommended, which means that without interpretation or attribution, all symptoms present contribute to a psychopathological diagnosis. All psychopathological syndromes are more common in the hypokinetic rigid subtype of the disease. CONCLUSION: The recognition and treatment of psychopathological symptoms in PD require specific expertise. In the treatment of pd patients, therefore, it is essential that there should be multidisciplinary collaboration between the neurologist, the neuropsychologist and the psychiatrist.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand migraine postdrome by directly interviewing migraine patients with postdrome symptoms. To document these symptoms, as well as impacts, as a prelude to developing a postdrome migraine questionnaire. BACKGROUND: Migraine attacks are traditionally divided into 4 phases. Of these, the postdrome is the least studied, and no patient-reported outcomes to assess symptoms and impacts of this migraine phase have been published. METHODS: Qualitative concept elicitation focus groups were conducted with 34 patients in 3 geographically diverse US cities to elicit the symptoms and burden of migraine postdrome. Data elicited from focus groups were coded using Atlas.ti software to facilitate identification of concepts and terminologies of migraine postdrome. A draft questionnaire was developed based on the symptoms and impacts of migraine postdrome described by patients. Cognitive debriefing interviews were conducted with 15 patients in Connecticut and Chicago to confirm content validity, relevance, and comprehension. RESULTS: Patients defined the onset of postdrome as when they no longer experienced the migraine pain. Postdrome was often described as "[being] or [feeling] wiped out" and "headache hangover." The symptoms most frequently reported by the patients who participated in the focus groups and included in the draft post-migraine questionnaire were: tiredness, difficulty concentrating, weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, and decreased energy. Patients also reported decreased activity level as a result of experiencing postdrome symptoms. Postdrome symptoms were reported to impact the ability to work, to affect family interactions and social life, and to cause cognitive impairment. A preliminary questionnaire measuring severity and duration of symptoms and severity of impacts of the post-migraine experience, with an 11-point (0 to 10) response scale, was developed. This preliminary questionnaire was tested for content validity, relevance, and comprehension using cognitive debriefing interviews. All patients reported that the questionnaire was relevant to their condition. Irrelevant and redundant items such as body tension and annoyance were eliminated. CONCLUSIONS: Migraine postdrome is debilitating for those who experience it. Concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing research support the relevance of the items in the post-migraine questionnaire. Future research will provide evidence of the post-migraine questionnaire's psychometric properties and interpretation guidelines.

T1  - Prevalence of sexual activity and associated factors in men aged 75 to 95 years: a cohort study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1539-3704
Y1  - 2010/12/07
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge about sexuality in elderly persons is limited, and normative data are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of older men who are sexually active and to explore factors predictive of sexual activity. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Community-dwelling men from Perth, Western Australia, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 3274 men aged 75 to 95 years. MEASUREMENTS: Questionnaires from 1996 to 1999, 2001 to 2004, and 2008 to 2009 assessed social and medical factors. Sex hormones were measured from 2001 to 2004. Sexual activity was assessed by questionnaire from 2008 to 2009. RESULTS: A total of 2783 men (85.0%) provided data on sexual activity. Sex was considered at least somewhat important by 48.8% (95% CI, 47.0% to 50.6%), and 30.8% (CI, 29.1% to 32.5%) had had at least 1 sexual encounter in the past 12 months. Of the latter, 56.5% were satisfied with the frequency of activity, whereas 43.0% had sex less often than preferred. In cross-sectional analyses, increasing age, partner's lack of interest, partner's physical limitations, osteoporosis, prostate cancer, diabetes, antidepressant use, and β-blocker use were independently associated with reduced odds of sexual activity. Living with a partner and having a non-English-speaking background were associated with increased odds. In longitudinal analyses, higher testosterone levels were associated with increased odds of being sexually active. Other factors were similar to the cross-sectional model. LIMITATIONS: Response bias may have influenced findings because sexuality can be a sensitive topic. Attrition may have resulted in a healthier-than-average sample of older men. CONCLUSION: One half of elderly men consider sex important, and one third report being sexually active. Men's health problems were associated with lack of sexual activity. Key modifiable risk factors include diabetes, depression, and medication use. Endogenous testosterone levels predict sexual activity, but the role of testosterone therapy remains uncertain.

T1  - Validation of diagnostic criteria for apathy in Parkinson's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-5126
Y1  - 2010/12/
ET  - 2010/09/22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome in Parkinson's Disease (PD) that affects quality of life. Research into apathy has been hampered by a lack of broadly accepted diagnostic criteria. Recently, diagnostic criteria for apathy in neuropsychiatric disorders have been proposed, which to date have not been validated in PD. AIM: To validate the proposed diagnostic criteria for apathy in PD. DESIGN AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, outpatients with PD visiting a movement disorders clinic underwent a protocolized assessment of motor function, activities of daily living (ADL), cognition and mood. In addition, the diagnostic criteria for apathy were administered as well as two apathy rating instruments: the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) and the apathy section of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). RESULTS: Of the included patients 17.2% were diagnosed with apathy according to the criteria. Acceptability and internal consistency of the criteria was good, as was the concurrent validity with the LARS and apathy section of the NPI. Discriminant validity of the criteria with depression was moderate to good. All domains of criterion B (behavior, cognition, emotion) contributed to the diagnosis of apathy, of which reduced goal-directed behavior was the most frequently observed symptom. CONCLUSION: The recently proposed diagnostic criteria for apathy are useful in clinical practice and in research with PD patients with and without cognitive impairment.

T1  - Psychometric evaluation of the Dutch version of the Mood, Interest and Pleasure Questionnaire (MIPQ)
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-3379
Y1  - 2010///Nov-Dec
ET  - 2010/06/08
AB  - Recently, several instruments have been developed to measure the subjective component of the quality of life (QOL) of people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD). A next step, however, must be the further validation of these instruments. The present study aimed at evaluating the psychometric properties of one of these instruments, the Dutch version of the Mood, Interest and Pleasure Questionnaire (MIPQ). The MIPQ is a 25-item Likert scale questionnaire with two subscales (Mood and Interest and Pleasure). The MIPQ and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist were completed on 360 participants with severe or profound intellectual disabilities. About 27% of these participants were included in an examination of test-retest of and the inter-rater reliability of the MIPQ. The results suggest that the proposed two-factor structure did not show an adequate fit to our data. An exploratory factor analysis revealed a three-factor structure with positive mood, negative mood and interest as three correlated but distinct subscales. These results are in concurrence with the literature on positive emotions. High internal consistency (α ≥ .80), high inter-rater (r ≥ .69) and high test-retest reliability (r ≥ .86) were found, which indicates the reliable use of the MIPQ in the population of people with PIMD. Strong negative correlations between the MIPQ total score and the Aberant Behavior Checklist's 'lethargy, social withdrawal' subscale provides some evidence of the construct validity of the MIPQ. However, further validation of the MIPQ including other measures of subjective well-being is warranted.

T1  - Estimated prevalence of fatigue following stroke and transient ischemic attack is dependent on terminology used and patient gender
LA  - eng
SN  - 1532-8511
Y1  - 2010///Nov-Dec
ET  - 2010/05/15
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of fatigue following stroke and Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) is disputed, with prevalences ranging from 30% to 72% reported. We hypothesized that methods and descriptors used may substantially affect the prevalence reported. METHODS: Subjects completed validated assessments of fatigue and sleepiness (the Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS] and Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]) as well as 5-point Likert scores on frequency of symptoms using the 5 statements of fatigue derived from patient interviews. RESULTS: Among the 91 subjects, the mean FSS score was 3.8. FSS score correlated more strongly with the statement "I have a lack of energy" (r=0.470; ρ<0.001; Spearman's rho) than with the statement "I feel physical fatigue" (r=0.349; ρ=0.001). The statement "I have a lack of energy" also produced the highest prevalence of severe symptoms, with 37% agreeing that they had the symptom "often" or "always." Agreement between Likert scales was only fair, the best being that for "I have a lack of energy" and "I feel physical fatigue" (κ=0.50). There was a gender difference in simple expression of fatigue, with the statement "I feel physical fatigue" correlating strongly with FSS score in males (r=0.61; ρ<0.001) but not correlating in females (r=0.039; ρ=0.29). Depending on which definition of fatigue was used, the prevalence of fatigue varied between 13% and 63%. FSS score correlated weakly with ESS score (r=0.287; ρ=0.008). Our data indicate significant variation in the prevalence of fatigue among subjects with stroke and transient ischemic attack depending on the descriptors and methods used to define it. CONCLUSION: There is a significant difference between the genders in how fatigue is expressed.

T1  - Repeat participation in colorectal cancer screening utilizing fecal occult blood testing: a community-based project in a rural setting
LA  - eng
SN  - 1440-1746
Y1  - 2010/10/
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: To investigate participation in a second round of colorectal cancer screening using a fecal occult blood test (FOBT) in an Australian rural community, and to assess the demographic characteristics and individual perspectives associated with repeat screening. METHODS: Potential participants from round 1 (50-74 years of age) were sent an intervention package and asked to return a completed FOBT (n = 3406). Doctors of participants testing positive referred to colonoscopy as appropriate. Following screening, 119 participants completed qualitative telephone interviews. Multivariable logistic regression models evaluated the association between round-2 participation and other variables. RESULTS: Round-2 participation was 34.7%; the strongest predictor was participation in round 1. Repeat participants were more likely to be female; inconsistent screeners were more likely to be younger (aged 50-59 years). The proportion of positive FOBT was 12.7%, that of colonoscopy compliance was 98.6%, and the positive predictive value for cancer or adenoma of advanced pathology was 23.9%. Reasons for participation included testing as a precautionary measure or having family history/friends with colorectal cancer; reasons for non-participation included apathy or doctors' advice against screening. CONCLUSION: Participation was relatively low and consistent across rounds. Unless suitable strategies are identified to overcome behavioral trends and/or to screen out ineligible participants, little change in overall participation rates can be expected across rounds.

T1  - Predictors of psychosocial distress 12 months after diagnosis with early and advanced prostate cancer
LA  - eng
SN  - 0025-729X
Y1  - 2010/09/06
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess psychosocial distress in patients with early (localised) and advanced (metastatic) prostate cancer (PCA) at diagnosis (Time 1) and 12 months later (Time 2), and identify psychosocial factors predictive of later distress. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Observational, prospective study of 367 men with early (211) or advanced (156) PCA recruited as consecutive attendees at clinics at seven public hospitals and practices in metropolitan Melbourne between 1 April 2001 and 30 December 2005. Both groups completed questionnaires at Time 1 and Time 2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Health-related quality of life as assessed by the Short Form 36-item Health Survey; psychological distress, including depression and anxiety as assessed by the Brief Symptom Inventory; and coping patterns as assessed by the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale. RESULTS: Over the 12 months, both the early and advanced PCA group showed reduced vitality and increased depression and anxiety; this effect was greater in the advanced PCA group. Mental health, social functioning and role-emotional functioning also deteriorated in the advanced group. Predictors of depression at Time 2 for the early PCA group were depression, vitality and a fatalistic coping pattern at Time 1; anxiety at Time 2 was predicted by anxiety and vitality at Time 1. In the advanced PCA group, depression at Time 2 was predicted by depression and mental health at Time 1; anxiety at Time 2 was predicted by anxiety, mental health, cognitive avoidance and lower anxious preoccupation at Time 1. CONCLUSIONS: Men with early PCA experience decreasing vitality and increasing psychological distress over the 12 months following diagnosis; this trend is accelerated after diagnosis with advanced PCA. A fatalistic coping pattern at diagnosis of early PCA predicts later depression while cognitive avoidance and lower anxious preoccupation at diagnosis of advanced PCA predict later anxiety.

T1  - Efficacy and tolerability of venlafaxine extended release in patients with major depressive disorder
LA  - eng
SN  - 0353-5053
Y1  - 2010/09/
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study we wanted to determine the efficacy and tolerability of venlafaxine extended release in patients with major depressive disorder. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 161 patients with major depressive disorder were included in an open-label, multicentre clinical study. All patients were treated with venlafaxine extended release in flexible doses ranging from 75 to 325 mg daily over an 8-week period. Efficacy measurements included the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale, the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I), the Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S), and the Depression and Somatic Symptom Scale (DSSS). All scales were administered at baseline and at weeks 2, 4 and 8. RESULTS: A total of 148 (91.2%) patients completed the study. After 8 weeks of treatment with venlafaxine extended release, response and remission rates were 93% and 45% respectively. At the end of the study, 52.7% of patients were rated on CGI-S with 2 or 1 (not ill/mildly ill) and on CGI-I 81.1% of patients were rated by the physician as much/very much improved. The severity of somatic symptoms such as headache, back pain, chest pain, tenderness of more than a half of body muscles, and fatigue or loss of energy decreased towards the end of the study (p<.0001). Adverse events caused discontinuation in 4.7% of patients. No significant changes of body mass (p=.237), Body Mass Index (p=.281), and heart rate (p=.840) were present, but systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly decreased (p<.0001) towards the end of the study. CONCLUSION: The data from this study indicate that venlafaxine XR is an efficient and safe therapeutic option for patients with major depressive disorder, with the additional effect of reducing associated painful physical symptoms.

T1  - The Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician rating scale (NPI-C): reliability and validity of a revised assessment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) affect almost all patients with dementia and are a major focus of study and treatment. Accurate assessment of NPS through valid, sensitive and reliable measures is crucial. Although current NPS measures have many strengths, they also have some limitations (e.g. acquisition of data is limited to informants or caregivers as respondents, limited depth of items specific to moderate dementia). Therefore, we developed a revised version of the NPI, known as the NPI-C. The NPI-C includes expanded domains and items, and a clinician-rating methodology. This study evaluated the reliability and convergent validity of the NPI-C at ten international sites (seven languages). METHODS: Face validity for 78 new items was obtained through a Delphi panel. A total of 128 dyads (caregivers/patients) from three severity categories of dementia (mild = 58, moderate = 49, severe = 21) were interviewed separately by two trained raters using two rating methods: the original NPI interview and a clinician-rated method. Rater 1 also administered four additional, established measures: the Apathy Evaluation Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Index, and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. Intraclass correlations were used to determine inter-rater reliability. Pearson correlations between the four relevant NPI-C domains and their corresponding outside measures were used for convergent validity. RESULTS: Inter-rater reliability was strong for most items. Convergent validity was moderate (apathy and agitation) to strong (hallucinations and delusions; agitation and aberrant vocalization; and depression) for clinician ratings in NPI-C domains. CONCLUSION: Overall, the NPI-C shows promise as a versatile tool which can accurately measure NPS and which uses a uniform scale system to facilitate data comparisons across studies.

T1  - Factor structure of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale in unipolar depression
LA  - eng
SN  - 1573-2517
Y1  - 2010/08/
ET  - 2010/01/06
AB  - BACKGROUND: In clinical practice patients with unipolar depression present with a variety of symptom clusters that may combine together in many different ways. However, only few factor analytic studies used general psychopathology scales to investigate the symptom structure of unipolar depression. METHODS: The study included 163 consecutive inpatients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of depressive disorder (ICD-10 codes F32 to F33). All patients were assessed with the 18-item version of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) within 3days from admission. Exploratory factor analysis with Varimax rotation was performed on BPRS items. RESULTS: Four factors were extracted, explaining 52% of total variance. They were interpreted as Apathy, Dysphoria, Depression and Psychoticism. The distribution of factor scores was approximately normal for Apathy, while it displayed a slight negative skewness for Depression, a slight positive skewness for Dysphoria, and a marked positive skewness for Psychoticism. Patient sex, family history of depression, lifetime history of suicide attempt, and recent serious family conflict were not associated with any factor. Occupational status, age, and age at onset displayed a positive correlation with Apathy. Duration of illness and number of previous admissions were positively correlated with Dysphoria. LIMITATIONS: Patients were not administered a structured diagnostic interview, and no detailed assessment of personality disorders was performed; also, patients were recruited only at a single site, which reduces the generalizability of the results. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that in depressive disorders there are psychopathological dimensions other than depressed mood that are worthy of greater clinical attention and research. Dimensions such as apathy and dysphoria may play an important part in the clinical phenomenology of unipolar depression and deserve systematic and careful assessment in order to provide patients with the best possible treatment and improve clinical outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To psychometrically refine a standardized scale for identifying those lifestyle changes that were most likely to contribute to anxiety and depression among prostate cancer (PCa) patients. METHODS: Three hundred and eighty-one PCa patients who had received their initial diagnosis between one and 96 months completed a survey of background variables, anxiety and depression inventories and the 36-item Effects of Prostate Cancer upon Lifestyle Questionnaire (EPCLQ). RESULTS: Levels of anxiety (24%) and depression (26%) were similar to those previously reported for PCa patients. The EPCLQ was shown to have satisfactory psychometric properties and significantly predicted anxiety and depression scores and the presence of psychological clinicity among this sample. Factor analysis of the EPCLQ showed that adverse emotions and social withdrawal, plus loss of cognitive ability, were the most powerful predictors of fear, physiological arousal, discomfort and pain factors underlying anxiety; these factors also predicted pessimism and fatigue factors underlying depression. conclusions: The EPCLQ was shown to be a reliably sound and valid instrument for assessing important lifestyle changes that predict anxiety and depression among PCa patients. In addition, links between receiving a diagnosis and treatment for PCa and development of psychosocial disturbance via emotional negativity, decreased cognitive performance and withdrawal from others appear to warrant further investigation.

T1  - Symptom clusters predict event-free survival in patients with heart failure
LA  - eng
SN  - 1550-5049
SN  - 0889-4655
Y1  - 2010///Jul-Aug
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical symptoms are likely to occur in clusters that may be associated with adverse outcome in patients with heart failure (HF). Despite the importance of early recognition of worsening symptoms in HF management, the impact of physical symptoms on adverse outcome has not been explored in the context of symptom clusters. PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to explore which physical symptom clusters occur in HF patients and to determine the impact of symptom clusters on event-free survival. METHODS: A total of 421 patients (60% male; 62 [SD, 14] years; 72% New York Heart Association class II/III) completed the modified Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Heart Failure to measure physical symptoms during an index hospitalization in Seoul, Korea. Times to first event of cardiac rehospitalization and cardiac death were collected for 12 months after discharge and confirmed by review of hospital records. An agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach with Ward's method was used to identify symptom clusters. Hierarchical Cox hazard regression was used to determine the impact of symptom clusters on cardiac rehospitalization and cardiac mortality. RESULTS: Two distinct symptom clusters, the dyspneic and the weary symptom clusters, occurred in patients with HF. Shortness of breath, difficulty breathing when lying flat, and waking up breathless at night comprised the dyspneic symptom cluster. Lack of energy, lack of appetite, and difficulty sleeping comprised the weary symptom cluster. In hierarchical Cox hazard regression, elevated distress from the weary symptom cluster independently predicted cardiac rehospitalization (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.93), and increased distress from the dyspneic symptom cluster independently predicted cardiac mortality (hazard ratio, 2.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-3.34). CONCLUSION: The weary and the dyspneic symptom clusters predicted cardiac rehospitalization and cardiac mortality, respectively. Patient education for self-monitoring of symptoms should focus on symptom clusters rather than single symptom.

T1  - Effects of testosterone supplementation on depressive symptoms and sexual dysfunction in hypogonadal men with the metabolic syndrome
LA  - eng
SN  - 1743-6109
Y1  - 2010/07/
ET  - 2010/05/26
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Low testosterone levels in men are associated with the metabolic syndrome (MetS) as well as with depressive symptoms, low vitality, and sexual dysfunction. AIM: To assess the effects of testosterone administration on these subjective symptoms, which have not extensively been studied in hypogonadal men with the MetS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-IA), Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) scale, and International Index of Erectile Function 5-item (IIEF-5) scale at baseline, 18 and 30 weeks were analysed using multilevel analysis. METHODS: In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase III trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00696748), 184 men suffering from both the MetS and hypogonadism were included. They were treated for 30 weeks with either parenteral testosterone undecanoate (TU; 1,000 mg IM TU, at baseline, and after 6 and 18 weeks; Nebido or placebo injections, 105 (92.9%) men receiving TU and 65 (91.5%) receiving placebo completed the 30-week trial. RESULTS: The 184 men were aged mean 52.1 years old (standard deviation [SD] 9.6; range 35-69), with a mean body mass index of 35.5 kg/m(2) (SD 6.7; range 25.1-54.8), and a mean total testosterone level of 8.0 nmol/L (SD 4.0). There were significant improvements in BDI-IA (mean difference vs. placebo after 30 weeks: -2.5 points; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.9; -4.1; P = 0.003), AMS (-7.4 points; 95% CI: -4.3; -10.5; P < 0.001), and IIEF-5 (+3.1 points; 95% CI: +1.8; +4.4; P < 0.001). The effects on the BDI-IA, AMS, and IIEF-5 were strongest in men with baseline total testosterone levels <7.7 mmol/L (i.e., median value). CONCLUSIONS: TU administration may improve depressive symptoms, aging male symptoms and sexual dysfunction in hypogonadal men with the MetS. The beneficial effects of testosterone were most evident in men with the lowest baseline total testosterone levels.

T1  - The Fatigue Questionnaire: Standardization in patients with major depression
LA  - eng
SN  - 0165-1781
Y1  - 2010/05/15
ET  - 2010/04/09
AB  - Fatigue measures have not been specifically standardized in depressed patients. This study aimed to investigate the reliability and validity of the 14-item Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ), a widely used multidimensional fatigue measure, in patients with major depression without comorbid fatigue-associated conditions. Subjects included were 81 patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores > or = 15 without conditions associated with prominent fatigue and 40 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. The vitality subscale of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36vit) and a visual analogue fatigue scale (VASF) served as standards of reference for reported fatigue. The FQ presented satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient 0.924), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.978), discriminant validity (between patients and controls) and concurrent validity (correlations with the SF-36vit and the VASF were -0.469 and 0.477, respectively). Factor analysis showed a two-factor structure (physical and mental fatigue), i.e. a structure similar to the one originally proposed. However, items 3 ('sleepiness'), 4 ('difficulty starting things') and 14 ('loss of interest') did not load on the factor expected. With these items removed, the derived 11-item version of the scale was shown to be a 'purer' measure of fatigue in depressed patients, independent of the severity of depression and comorbid sleepiness.

T1  - PDD-Short Screen: a brief cognitive test for screening dementia in Parkinson's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1531-8257
Y1  - 2010/03/15
AB  - The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) is currently based on clinical criteria (DSM-IV, MDS-Task Force). In daily practice and research studies, these criteria still depend on the subjective impression of the examiner. Brief screening tests (BST) are helpful in identifying patients with PD with dementia, which can be difficult in patients with advanced PD. We aimed to develop a BST for PD, the PDD-Short Screen (PDD-SS), to accurately and quickly screen for PDD. In this prospective study, 70 patients with nondemented (age 73.8 +/- 4.4) and 32 demented (age 73.8 +/- 4.4) PD regularly attending a Movement Disorders Clinic were included. Diagnosis of dementia was based on DSM-IV criteria, CDR score >or=1, and PD-CRS total score <or=64. The PDD-SS, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were administered to all participants. Validity, reliability, and discriminative power of the PDD-SS were examined. The final version of the scale included the items immediate and delayed verbal memory, clock drawing, alternating verbal fluency, and a questionnaire covering cognitive and psychiatric (hallucinations, apathy) symptoms common in PDD. A cutoff score <or=11 on the PDD-SS yielded high sensitivity (89.8%) and specificity (88.5%) for diagnosing PDD. The MDRS displayed similar accuracy, but the PDD-SS administration time was significantly shorter (4.8-6.9 vs. 17.5-25.2 minutes). Diagnosis of dementia using the PDD-SS was not influenced by age, education, or motor function. The PDD-SS appears as the first BST for diagnosing PDD, displays an excellent diagnostic accuracy, and takes 5 to 7 minutes to be administered.

T1  - Misreporting of energy intake in the elderly using doubly labeled water to measure total energy expenditure and weight change
LA  - eng
SN  - 1541-1087
SN  - 0731-5724
Y1  - 2010/02/
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the major problems in dietary assessment is inaccuracy in reporting diet. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between self-reported energy intake (EI) by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and energy expenditure (EE), measured by doubly labeled water (DLW), among older persons. DESIGN: EE was assessed in 298 high-functioning, community-dwelling older adults (70-79 years of age) over a 2-week period using DLW. Dietary intake was assessed using a Block FFQ. The ratio between reported EI and total energy expenditure (TEE) was calculated. Misreporting was defined as follows: participants with an EI/TEE ratio of <0.77 were categorized as low energy reporters, while participants with an EI/TEE ratio >1.28 were categorized as high energy reporters. Participants with an EI/TEE ratio of 0.77-1.28 were categorized as "true" energy reporters. One-year percent weight change prior to EE visit was used as another validation indicator. Participants who were low energy reporters but lost >2% of their body weight were categorized as undereaters. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-six participants provided both FFQ and DLW measurements. Forty-three percent of participants were low energy reporters; among them, almost 30% lost weight and, therefore, were categorized as undereaters. The undereaters consumed significantly fewer calories. No difference in the frequency of low energy reporting was detected between genders or racial groups. Underreporters had significantly higher body weight than "true" or high reporters. Undereaters tended to have higher body mass index than the underreporters. CONCLUSIONS: Undereating is prevalent in the elderly and may be falsely perceived as underreporting. It should be further addressed and characterized in future studies.

T1  - The cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome: myth or reality?
LA  - eng
SN  - 1433-7339
Y1  - 2010/02/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversy exists as what constitutes the cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome (CACS), and whether it truly is a distinct clinical disorder. In this study, we aimed to: (1) assess if CACS is a distinct clinical disorder, (2) identify the symptoms characteristic of CACS, (3) evaluate CACS impact on patient outcomes (symptom burden and survival time from referral). METHODS: Consecutive patients referred to palliative medicine were assessed by 38-symptom questionnaire. Demographics, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), disease and extent, and survival were recorded. CACS, defined as anorexia plus weight loss (>10% of pre-illness weight). For analysis, patients were divided into four groups: (1) group CACS; (2) group A (only anorexia, NO >10% pre-illness weight loss); (3) group WL (weight loss >10% pre-illness weight only but NO anorexia); and (4) group N (NO weight loss >10% pre-illness weight and NO anorexia). Symptoms present in > or =5%, and patients with complete data were analyzed. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-four patients had complete data, metastatic cancer, and 26 symptoms present in > or =5%. Groups had significantly different ECOG, symptom burden, and survival. Significantly different symptom prevalence between groups: dry mouth,*early satiety,*constipation,*nausea,*taste changes,*vomiting,*dysphagia,*fatigue,*weak,*lack of energy, insomnia, dyspnea, depression, hoarseness, and anxiety. The nine symptoms with asterisk were CACS specific. Symptom Burden: CACS independently predicted greatest burden. Survival: Group N had significantly longer survival. CONCLUSIONS: CACS appeared to be a distinct disorder with unique clinical characteristics in our advanced cancer population. Nine other symptoms constituted CACS. CACS independently predicted higher symptom burden. CACS absence predicted longer survival. More evidence is needed to better characterize this syndrome and generate a valid CACS consensus. A comprehensive validated CACS assessment instrument is required.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is a major behavioural problem in dementia and other neuropsychiatric diseases. AIM: To provide an overview of the development of the concept of apathy and its importance for clinical practice. METHOD: The article is based on a review of the literature. RESULTS: There is evidence that apathy should be regarded as a syndrome rather than a symptom. Apathy is a construct that has several aspects and can occur across a range of diseases.It can occur as part of depressive disorders or cognitive deterioration or it can occur independently. Recently, diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of the apathy syndrome have been formulated on the basis of an international consensus. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic criteria that have been formulated recently will make it much easier to validate measuring instruments and research into the epidemiology, aetiology, pathophysiology and treatment of apathy.

LA  - eng
SN  - 1421-9824
Y1  - 2010
ET  - 2010/02/03
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: We designed this study to examine subsyndromes in Korean patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). METHODS: Initial participants were 778 AD patients recruited from the Clinical Research Center for Dementia of South Korea and assessed via the Korean Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Those with > or =1 neuropsychiatric symptom were randomly divided into groups. Principal axis factoring with oblimin rotation was used to analyze group 1 inventory results, and maximum likelihood estimation extraction with Bollen-Stine bootstrapping was used for group 2. RESULTS: The results of the EFA showed the presence of 4 subsyndromes: hyperactivity, affect, psychosis and apathy/vegetative symptom. The CFA results indicated this model was the best-fitting model for explaining these subsyndromes. CONCLUSION: Our model showed the best fit and identified 4 subsyndromes. This study might contribute to a clearer understanding of the neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to identify clinical factors in the acute stage that can predict anxiety, depression and apathy at 4 months after stroke. METHODS: One hundred four consecutive stroke patients in a stroke unit were assessed within the first 2 weeks and after 4 months. Assessments included anxiety and depression symptoms on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [HADS Anxiety subscale (HADS-A) > or = 8 and HADS Depression subscale (HADS-D) > or = 8], physical impairment, functional disability, somatic comorbidity upon admission, assessment of apathy (score > or = 34 on the Apathy Evaluation Scale) and a psychiatric Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition diagnosis of anxiety disorder (anxiety) or depression (depression) on follow-up. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with anxiety, depression and apathy. RESULTS: Anxiety and depression at 4 months were significantly associated with HADS-A scores of > or = 8 upon admission [odds ratio (OR)=4.4; 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.7-11.9; P=.003 and OR=2.9; 95% CI=1.0-7.9; P=.043, respectively]. Apathy at 4 months was significantly associated with somatic comorbidity upon admission (OR=3.0; 95% CI=1.0-8.3; P=.036) and had a borderline association with HADS-D scores of > or = 8 (OR=8.4; 95% CI=1.0-72.0; P=.051) upon admission. CONCLUSION: Assessment with HADS within the first 2 weeks of stroke can contribute to the detection of patients at risk for clinically significant anxiety, depression and apathy at 4 months after stroke.

T1  - Clinical presentation and outcome of geriatric depression in subcortical ischemic vascular disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1423-0003
Y1  - 2010
ET  - 2009/12/24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular damage of frontal-subcortical circuits involved in mood regulation and cognition might be the main contributor to the pathogenesis of late-life depression, and it is linked to poor response to treatment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between executive dysfunction and outcome of depressive symptoms among elderly patients with subcortical ischemic vascular disease. METHODS: Ninety-two elderly patients with white matter lesions (WMLs) or lacunar infarcts (LAs) on brain MRI and depressive symptomatology were consecutively recruited. Depression was rated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Evaluation of executive functions by means of the Stroop color-word test was performed at entry of the study, and WMLs were categorized into mild, moderate or severe. Mood was reevaluated by means of HDRS after the 12th week of pharmacological treatment. RESULTS: Psychomotor retardation, difficulties at work, apathy, and lack of insight were the predominant symptoms. Fifty-six patients (62.8%) had a neuroradiological picture of WMLs, while the remaining 33 (37.1%) had LAs. Executive dysfunctions significantly and independently predict poor outcome of depressive symptoms. Patients with the severest WMLs showed not only a greater executive dysfunction, but also a minor response to antidepressant treatment. CONCLUSION: This study supports the vascular depression hypothesis. WMLs are of crucial clinical relevance as they are linked with cognitive symptoms and poor antidepressant outcome.

T1  - Apathy in first episode psychosis patients: one year follow up
LA  - eng
SN  - 1573-2509
Y1  - 2010/01/
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study describes how the negative subsyndrome of apathy develops over the first year in first episode psychosis (FEP) patients, with an emphasis on the prevalence of enduring apathy and the relationship between apathy, other symptoms and functioning. METHODS: Eighty four FEP patients were assessed both at baseline and after one year with the abridged clinical version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-C-Apathy). Other symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative syndrome scale (PANSS) and functioning with the split version of the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF-F). RESULTS: The mean level of AES-C-Apathy decreased from baseline to the one year follow up for the whole group of FEP patients. High levels of apathy at 1year were best predicted by high levels of apathy at baseline, a long DUP and a diagnosis within the Schizophrenia spectrum. The presence of depression and level of medication only had a minor influence. AES-C-Apathy had a stronger association to GAF-F than other PANSS symptom areas. Twenty five (30%) FEP patients had high enduring levels of apathy. This group consisted of significantly more males, had a longer duration of untreated psychosis, a greater likelihood of a Schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis, fewer were in remission of positive symptoms and they had significantly poorer functioning at both baseline and follow up. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that the negative subsyndrome of apathy is significantly related to poor functioning in FEP. Including negative symptoms and its subsyndromes in early detection strategies are warranted.

T1  - Rasch analysis of the Beck Depression Inventory-II in a neurological rehabilitation sample
LA  - eng
SN  - 0963-8288
Y1  - 2010
AB  - PURPOSE: To apply Rasch analysis to the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) responses of a mixed neurorehabilitation sample to determine its suitability for assessing depression among this group. METHOD: Three hundred and fifteen in-patients undergoing post-acute specialist in-patient rehabilitation at the Regional Rehabilitation Unit (RRU) of Northwick Park Hospital in North London were administered the Beck Depression Inventory. All patients were administered the BDI-II by a clinical psychologist using a large print version and taking as much time as patients required. Rasch analysis was completed using the RUMM2020 software. Where disordered thresholds were identified item rescoring was undertaken. Each item was also examined for Differential Item Functioning. Where misfit to model expectations was identified items were removed in an iterative fashion. The effect of any deletion upon person estimates was examined. Specific tests of unidimensionality were undertaken at each iterative phase. RESULTS: Rescoring was necessary before Items 1-4, 6, 8-12, 20 and 21 showed ordered thresholds. Three items failed to satisfy model expectations - items 16 (changes in sleeping pattern), 18 (changes in appetite) and 21 (loss of interest in sex) and were deleted - after which good overall fit to the Rasch model was observed. The three items deleted affected person estimates in a significant way such that the 21 item version in this group of patients may be biased because of multidimensionality. CONCLUSIONS: The BDI-II in a sample of patients undergoing neurorehabilitation satisfies unidimensional Rasch model expectations in an 18-item format. Some disordering of response categories was evident, but this evidence requires replication before any common rescoring option should be considered.

T1  - Frontal-lobe mediated behavioral dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
LA  - eng
SN  - 1468-1331
Y1  - 2010/01/
ET  - 2009/10/29
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment secondary to frontal lobe atrophy exists in 40-60% of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) cases. We aimed to determine the prevalence of frontal-lobe mediated behavioral impairment in (ALS) and to ascertain its relationship to cognitive impairment. METHODS: Two-hundred and twenty five patients diagnosed with sporadic ALS were evaluated for behavioral dysfunction using the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe), a validated measure used to examine frontal-lobe mediated behaviors, specifically apathy, executive dysfunction and disinhibition; a total behavior score is also provided. Additionally, a subset of patients also underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. RESULTS: Changes in the total FrSBe scores were observed in 24.4% of the patients and 39.6% of the patients had impairment in at least one behavioral domain with symptoms of Apathy being the most common (31.1%). Cognitively impaired ALS patients had worse total (P = 0.05) and apathy scores (P < 0.01); however, behavioral dysfunction was also present in 16% of the cognitively intact patients. Half of the behaviorally intact patients exhibited cognitive impairment. Significant correlations were observed for performance on certain neuropsychological tests (Animal fluency, Block Design, Logical Memory I and Verbal Series Attention Test) and severity of behavioral dysfunction on certain FrSBe sub scores. CONCLUSIONS: Frontal-lobe mediated behavioral dysfunction appears to be common in ALS. Cognitively impaired ALS patients had greater behavioral dysfunction. Recognition of behavioral and cognitive dysfunction may assist health-care providers and care-givers recognize changes in decision-making capacity and treatment compliance of patients with ALS.

T1  - Environmental correlates of neuropsychiatric symptoms in nursing home patients with dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 1099-1166
Y1  - 2010/01/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the influence of environmental correlates of neuropsychiatric symptoms in nursing home patients with dementia. METHODS: 1289 patients in 56 Dementia Special Care Units (SCUs) in the Netherlands were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Potential correlates of the neuropsychiatric symptoms studied were gender and age of the patient, dementia severity, psychoactive medication use and environmental correlates such as the number of patients per unit or per living room, staff size/patient ratio, time spent on care activities and presence of a walking circuit. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the relative contribution of the different factors in explaining neuropsychiatric symptoms variability. RESULTS: The prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms differed between SCUs, also after correcting for patient factors. Patient-related factors explained 7-21% of the total variance of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Intra Class Correlation (the correlation of symptoms of patients within SCUs) ranged from 0.039 (psychosis) to 0.163 (apathy). The variance in SCU symptom prevalence (variance between SCUs) accounted for 3.5-14.8% of the total variance in neuropsychiatric symptoms. In SCUs of which the staff spent more time on care activities did the patients show lower levels of apathy. Other environmental correlates did not predict neuropsychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSION: The substantial variation of prevalence rates between SCUs in combination with the clustering of symptoms within SCUs is strong evidence for the environmental contribution to neuropsychiatric symptoms and the multifactorial nature of behaviour in dementia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the longitudinal course of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma during their post-treatment follow-up and re-adaptation to normal life. We report on the HRQoL of patients treated in the randomised H8 trial of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Lymphoma Group and the Groupe d'Etudes des Lymphomes de l'Adulte (GELA). We aimed to assess HRQoL and fatigue following treatment, to analyse relations with treatment, and to identify factors that predict persistent fatigue. METHODS: Patients received HRQoL questionnaires at the end of primary therapy and during follow-up. The EORTC QLQ-C30 was used to assess HRQoL, and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) was used to assess fatigue. Changes of mean HRQoL scores over time were analysed with mixed models. Multiple polytomic nominal logistic regression was done to identify independent baseline predictors of fatigue within MFI-20 dimensions. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This study is registered with www.ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00379041. FINDINGS: 2666 assessments from 935 patients were analysed. Mean follow-up was 90 months (range 52-118). Age affected all functioning and symptom scores except emotional functioning, with younger age associated with higher functioning and lower severity of symptoms; improvement with time showed similar patterns between age groups. Women reported lower HRQoL and higher symptom scores than did men. Overall, 3.2% (14/439 for role functioning) to 9.7% (43/442 for social functioning) and 5.8% (29/498 for reduced motivation) to 9.9% (49/498 for general fatigue) of patients reported impairments of 10 points or more (on a 0-100 scale) in QLQ-C30 and MFI-20 scores, respectively, independent of age and sex. Emotional domains were more affected than physical ones. There was no relation between HRQoL outcome and type of treatment. Fatigue (MFI-20 scores) at the end of treatment was the only predictive variable for persistent fatigue, with odds ratios varying from 2.58 (95% CI 1.00-6.67) to 41.51 (12.02-143.33; p</=0.0001). Sensitivity analyses adjusting for missing data were much the same as the main results. INTERPRETATION: HRQoL data after treatment for early-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma show that patients experience strain and limitations in all subdomains apart from cognitive functioning (QLQ-C30), and also have reduced motivation (MFI-20). Differences in HRQoL improvement with time were linked to age and sex, but not type of treatment. Fatigue status at the end of treatment seems to predict subsequent HRQoL.

T1  - Energy intake and expenditure profile in chronic peritoneal dialysis patients complicated with circulatory congestion
LA  - eng
SN  - 1938-3207
Y1  - 2009/11/
ET  - 2009/09/23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Circulatory congestion is an adverse predictor of mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the nutritional status, energy intake, and expenditure profile of PD patients with and without previous circulatory congestion. DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 244 PD patients, of whom 92 had previous circulatory congestion. We estimated dietary energy intake by using a locally validated 7-d food-frequency questionnaire and by assessing resting energy expenditure (REE) and total energy expenditure (TEE) with indirect calorimetry and a locally validated physical activity questionnaire, respectively. RESULTS: In comparison with those without circulatory congestion, patients with previous circulatory congestion were more malnourished by subjective global assessment (59% compared with 36%; P < 0.001), had lower handgrip strength, had lower midarm muscle circumference, had lower dietary protein (0.98 +/- 0.45 compared with 1.19 +/- 0.44 g x kg(-1) x d(-1); P < 0.001), and had lower energy intake (92.5 +/- 37.0 compared with 110.9 +/- 35.7 kJ x kg(-1) x d(-1); P < 0.001) but had higher C-reactive protein (P = 0.025) and higher REE (P < 0.001). However, no difference in TEE was noted between the 2 groups, which indicated lower activity energy expenditure among patients with previous circulatory congestion. The resulting energy balance was significantly more negative for patients with previous circulatory congestion than for those without previous circulatory congestion (P = 0.050). Furthermore, the prevalence of malnutrition increased with increasing episodes of circulatory congestion (P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with previous circulatory congestion had significantly more inflammation, more muscle wasting, and higher REE but lower activity energy expenditure and energy and protein intakes in keeping with an anorexia-cachexia syndrome. The mechanisms of increased REE and reduced energy intake among patients with previous circulatory congestion warrant further investigation.

T1  - Assessment of factors that contribute to decreased quality of life in Gynecologic Oncology Group ovarian cancer trials
LA  - eng
SN  - 0008-543X
SN  - 1097-0142
Y1  - 2009/10/15
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess which quality-of-life (QOL) line items on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian (FACT-O) were associated with low QOL in women who were receiving chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. METHODS: Patients with stage III or IV ovarian cancer on Gynecologic Oncology Group Protocols 152 and 172 who underwent primary surgery followed by intravenous paclitaxel and cisplatin completed the FACT-O. The FACT scale includes the 4 domains of physical, functional, social, and emotional well being (PWB, FWB, SWB, EWB, respectively). Women who had overall FACT-O scores in the lowest quartile (Q1) were compared with women in the upper 3 quartiles (Q2-Q4). The proportions of women in each group that selected the 2 worst categories for each item were compared. The level of significance was set at P<.005. RESULTS: Before Cycle 4, 361 patients (86.4%) provided valid QOL assessments. For PWB, a significantly greater proportion of women in Q1 versus Q2 through Q4 selected the 2 worst categories of several physical symptoms (nausea, pain, feeling ill, and being bothered by the side effects of treatment). For FWB, significant differences included being able to work, being content with the quality of their life, and sleeping well. For EWB, there were significant differences in feeling nervous and worrying about dying. There were virtually no differences between groups in SWB. Low interest in sex was reported by 56% to 88% of all patients (Q1-Q4). CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of women with FACT-O scores in the lowest quartile reported problems that potentially were amenable to clinical interventions, such as symptom management and psychosocial support.

T1  - Coping styles in heart failure patients with depressive symptoms
LA  - eng
SN  - 1879-1360
SN  - 0022-3999
Y1  - 2009/10/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Elevated depressive symptoms have been linked to poorer prognosis in heart failure (HF) patients. Our objective was to identify coping styles associated with depressive symptoms in HF patients. METHODS: A total of 222 stable HF patients (32.75% female, 45.4% non-Hispanic black) completed multiple questionnaires. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) assessed depressive symptoms, Life Orientation Test (LOT-R) assessed optimism, ENRICHD Social Support Inventory (ESSI) and Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) assessed social support, and COPE assessed coping styles. Linear regression analyses were employed to assess the association of coping styles with continuous BDI scores. Logistic regression analyses were performed using BDI scores dichotomized into BDI<10 vs. BDI> or =10, to identify coping styles accompanying clinically significant depressive symptoms. RESULTS: In linear regression models, higher BDI scores were associated with lower scores on the acceptance (beta=-.14), humor (beta=-.15), planning (beta=-.15), and emotional support (beta=-.14) subscales of the COPE, and higher scores on the behavioral disengagement (beta=.41), denial (beta=.33), venting (beta=.25), and mental disengagement (beta=.22) subscales. Higher PSSS and ESSI scores were associated with lower BDI scores (beta=-.32 and -.25, respectively). Higher LOT-R scores were associated with higher BDI scores (beta=.39, P<.001). In logistical regression models, BDI> or =10 was associated with greater likelihood of behavioral disengagement (OR=1.3), denial (OR=1.2), mental disengagement (OR=1.3), venting (OR=1.2), and pessimism (OR=1.2), and lower perceived social support measured by PSSS (OR=.92) and ESSI (OR=.92). CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms in HF patients are associated with avoidant coping, lower perceived social support, and pessimism. Results raise the possibility that interventions designed to improve coping may reduce depressive symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The mechanisms by which depression is associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease remain unclear. It is possible that depressive symptoms could increase the risk of hypertension, which in turn could predispose to cardiovascular disease. The goal of this study was to explore whether individual depressive symptoms might predict the incidence of hypertension in a cohort of 240 initially normotensive Mexican-American and European-American elders. METHODS: Subjects were 65-78 years old on entering the San Antonio Longitudinal Study of Aging, an epidemiologic survey, at which time they completed the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale in English or Spanish. Their blood pressure was reassessed a mean of 7.0 years later. Responses to six key scale items (depressed mood, decreased interest, worthlessness, hopelessness, helplessness, and fatigue) were evaluated for the ability to predict incident hypertension. RESULTS: In univariate analyses, only helplessness significantly predicted incident hypertension (chi-square 13.5, df=1, P=.0003). In a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for sex, education, number of comorbid diseases, current drinking, social well-being, and marital status, helplessness remained a very strong predictor [hazard ratio (HR) 4.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.90-13.12, P=.0011]. Total depression score also predicted incident hypertension, but less strongly (HR 1.08, CI 1.00-1.17, P=.0339). CONCLUSION: Helplessness may predict the development of hypertension in the elderly. Further research into this relationship might lead to interventions to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

T1  - The symptomatology of post-stroke depression: comparison of stroke and myocardial infarction patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 1099-1166
Y1  - 2009/10/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a frequent problem in stroke patients but, all too often, the problem goes unrecognized. How depression-like symptoms in post-stroke depression (PSD) should be interpreted is still subject to debate. If PSD has a distinct symptom profile of depression accompanying other chronic vascular somatic conditions then this could imply that PSD is a specific disease entity. OBJECTIVE: To study whether depressed stroke patients exhibit other signs and symptoms than patients suffering from depression after myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS: Depressive signs and symptoms were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The results of 190 stroke patients were compared with the results of 198 MI patients every 3 months during the first year after the event. RESULTS: Depressed stroke patients exhibited more loss of interest, psychomotor retardation, and gastro-intestinal complaints as compared to depressed MI patients. However, in multivariate analyses including both depressed and non-depressed stroke and MI patients, no specific symptom profile was found to differentiate between the two depressive syndromes by looking at the modifying effect of stroke vs MI on the occurrence of specific symptoms in depression. CONCLUSION: Although in their clinical presentation, depressed stroke patients exhibit a symptom profile different from depressed MI patients, this is not due to differences in the depressive syndrome in these two patient groups but it reflects differences between stroke and MI patients in general.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited research has investigated the specific needs of patients with advanced incurable cancer. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of perceived needs among this population. METHODS: Medical specialists from two regions in New South Wales, Australia, identified patients with advanced, incurable cancer, who were estimated to have a life expectancy of <2 years and were not receiving formal palliative care. Of the 418 eligible patients, 246 (59%) consented to participate. Consenting patients completed the Needs Assessment for Advanced Cancer Patients questionnaire, which has demonstrable validity and reliability. Patients' perceived needs were assessed across the seven domains of the questionnaire: psychological, daily living, medical communication and information, symptom related, social, spiritual and financial needs. RESULTS: Patients identified the greatest areas of need in relation to psychological and medical communication/information domains. Patients' specific needs were highest in dealing with a lack of energy and tiredness, coping with fears about the cancer spreading, and coping with frustration at not being able to do the things they used to do. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that patients with advanced, incurable cancer have high levels of unmet needs, especially in relation to the areas of psychological and medical communication/information needs. The data have the potential to guide the development of interventions aimed at meeting the current unmet needs of patients with advanced, incurable cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) and to study the relationship between anhedonia, depression and cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: The SHAPS (14 items) was translated into Italian and pre-tested in a pilot study. Two items evaluating physical anhedonia related to sexual issues were added. The Italian version of SHAPS was validated in 274 consecutive PD patients, divided into patients with major depression according to DSM-IV criteria (dPD) and patients without depression (nPD), and in healthy subjects. To test the feasibility of the instrument and to determine whether clinical data affect anhedonia, we also administered SHAPS to 1307 patients with different types of parkinsonism. RESULTS: The Italian SHAPS proved to be easy to understand as regards the question and answer modes. Intraclass coefficient for test-retest reliability was 0.65 for the total score. KR index was 0.61. ANOVA of the SHAPS total score revealed that scores were higher in dPD patients than in healthy controls and nPD (p<0.05). In the 1307 patients with various types of parkinsonism, the SHAPS data showed that anhedonia was related to age, type of parkinsonism, apathy, depression and cognitive impairment. Anhedonia was correlated with frontal dysfunctions in supranuclear palsy and PD patients (r=-0.682 and -0.264 respectively, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The Italian version of the SHAPS is a reliable tool with which to assess anhedonia in patients with PD and other forms of parkinsonism.

T1  - DSM-IV Major Depressive Episode in the elderly: the relationship between the number and the type of depressive symptoms and impairment
LA  - eng
SN  - 1573-2517
Y1  - 2009/09/
ET  - 2009/01/22
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of studies that assess whether the DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive Episode (MDE) that use a diagnostic threshold are valid for the elderly and whether each symptom of depression contributes equally to impairment in this group. METHOD: The Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing is a population-based epidemiological survey which utilized the Composite International Diagnostic Instrument to diagnose MDE. Analyses were based on the survey respondents who endorsed either (or both) the "depressed mood" or "loss of interest" core MDE symptoms (60+ years, n=278; 40+ years, n=1020). A series of multivariate linear regression analyses were run to assess the relationship between the number and the type of depressive symptoms and five measures of impairment. RESULTS: For those aged 60+ years, a linear relationship alone was observed for the relationship between the number of depressive symptoms and each of the five measures but not all symptoms of depression were equal predictors of impairment; loss of energy was the most consistent predictor. When the regression analyses were repeated using respondents aged 40+ years, consistent significant interactions between age and individual symptoms of depression were not observed. LIMITATIONS: The dimensionality of MDE is assessed focusing solely on symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our data illustrate the apparent dimensional structure of MDE and the differential impact of depressive symptoms on impairment in an elderly sub-sample. There was little support for systematic age-dependent changes. Adjustments to the diagnostic criteria of MDE may not require age-dependent distinctions.

T1  - Cognitive coping and goal adjustment in people with Peripheral Arterial Disease: relationships with depressive symptoms
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-5134
Y1  - 2009/07/
ET  - 2008/12/20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study relationships between cognitive coping strategies, goal adjustment processes (goal disengagement and re-engagement) and symptoms of depression in people with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD). METHODS: The sample consisted of 88 patients with PAD. Strategies of cognitive coping, goal disengagement, goal re-engagement, and depression were measured by written questionnaires. The main statistical methods were Pearson correlations and Multiple Regression Analyses. RESULTS: The results showed that a ruminative and catastrophizing way of coping in response to the disabilities was related to more depressive symptoms in this group. In contrast, coping by seeking and re-engaging in alternative, meaningful goals was related to less depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that improvements in cognitive and goal-related coping strategies might reduce the level or risk of depressive symptomatology. This confirms the need for specific intervention programs that bring about effective changes in the coping strategies of people suffering from PAD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: As both cognitive and goal-related coping are generally assumed to be mechanisms that are subject to potential influence and change, the results of this study provide important targets for such an intervention.

T1  - The syndromal validity and nosological position of apathy in Parkinson's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1531-8257
Y1  - 2009/06/15
AB  - Although apathy is among the most frequent behavioral changes in Parkinson's disease (PD), its diagnosis is still problematic, and the overlap with depression and dementia poorly studied. Aim of the study was validate specific criteria to diagnose apathy in PD, and to examine its association with subsyndromes of depression and dementia. A series of 164 patients with PD, 44 patients with "primary" depression and no PD, 23 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 26 age-comparable healthy controls underwent a comprehensive psychiatric assessment that included a structured psychiatric interview and the Apathy Scale. A set of seven diagnostic criteria showed high sensitivity and specificity for clinically diagnosed apathy. Fifty-two of the 164 patients with PD (32%) met diagnostic criteria for apathy. Eighty-three percent of patients with apathy had comorbid depression and 56% had dementia. Only 5 of the 40 PD patients (13%) with neither depression nor dementia had apathy. We validated a set of standardized criteria for the diagnosis of apathy in PD. About one third of a series of patients attending a Movement Disorders Clinic showed apathy. Both depression and dementia were the most frequent comorbid conditions of apathy in PD.

T1  - Pattern of behavioral disturbances in corticobasal degeneration syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy
LA  - eng
SN  - 1041-6102
Y1  - 2009/06/
ET  - 2009/03/27
AB  - BACKGROUND: A careful characterization of behavioral abnormalities in corticobasal degeneration syndrome (CBDS) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) by reliable tools is still lacking. Literature data provided evidence of the usefulness of the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) to operationalize such disturbances, particularly in the frontotemporal lobar degeneration spectrum. The study aimed to evaluate the frequency and pattern of presentation of behavioral disturbances in a large sample of CBDS and PSP patients by FBI. METHODS: Sixty-eight CBDS and 57 PSP patients entered the study and underwent a standardized clinical and neuropsychological battery, and a structural brain imaging study. Behavioral disturbances were carefully analyzed by FBI. RESULTS: FBI scores were relatively low in both groups, being 6.7 +/- 8.2 and 5.6 +/- 6.1 in CBDS and PSP, respectively. Comparison of the behavioral profile between CBDS and PSP patients showed significant differences in apathy were more frequent in the latter (57.9% vs. 33.8%, P = 0.007), and the presence of alien hand/apraxia more frequent in the former group 39.7% vs. 10.5%, P = 0.001). Apathy correlated neither with age nor with motor disturbances as measured by UPDRS-III. Overall, the most frequent behavioral abnormalities present in both groups (>25%) were aspontaneity and logopenia. Aphasia (27.9%) and irritability (35.3%) were more frequent in CBDS compared to PSP, even if not statistically different. DISCUSSION: The present study has provided measures of behavioral disturbances in a population of PSP and CBDS patients, and further confirms the usefulness of the FBI scale.

T1  - The association between motor subtypes and psychopathology in Parkinson's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1873-5126
Y1  - 2009/06/
ET  - 2008/10/31
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Parkinson's disease (PD) it has been suggested that various motor subtypes are also characterized by a different prevalence and severity of specific non-motor symptoms such as cognitive deterioration, depression, apathy and hallucinations. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between motor subtypes and psychopathology in PD. METHODS: An exploratory and confirmatory cluster analysis of motor and psychopathological symptoms was performed with a randomized sample of 173 patients each, stemming from two research databases: one from Stavanger University Hospital and one from Maastricht University Hospital. These databases contained data of standardized assessments of patients with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Mini-Mental State Examination. RESULTS: PD patients can be accurately and reliably classified into four different subtypes: rapid disease progression subtype, young-onset subtype, non-tremor-dominant subtype with psychopathology and a tremor-dominant subtype. Cognitive deterioration, depressive and apathetic symptoms, and hallucinations all cluster within the non-tremor-dominant motor subtype, that is characterized by hypokinesia, rigidity, postural instability and gait disorder. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that non-tremor-dominant PD is associated with cognitive deterioration, depression, apathy, and hallucinations, which has implications for future research into the pathophysiology of psychopathology in PD.

AB  - Current practice often assesses apathy with a single item from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS, item 4). Yet, the relationship between the UPDRS item 4 and the validated Apathy Scale (AS) is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the operating characteristics of UPDRS item 4 in relation to the AS. Three hundred and one patients with PD were administered the AS and the UPDRS. We compared the UPDRS item 4 to the standard AS classification of > or =14 as apathetic. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was obtained, and sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive power were calculated. The ROC curve showed area under the curve as 0.75. A cut-off of 1 had good sensitivity (81%) but poor specificity (53%; high false positive rate). A cut-off point of 2 had acceptable specificity (87%) but poor sensitivity (52%, high false negative rate). Continuing to increasing the cut-off point (e.g., 3, 4) continues to increase specificity at the expense of dramatically reducing sensitivity. These findings suggest the use of caution when screening for apathy with item 4 due to its poor sensitivity in relation to the AS.

T1  - Examination of the Lille Apathy Rating Scale in Parkinson disease
LA  - eng

SN  - 0885-3185
Y1  - 2009/04/15
AB  - Apathy is a unique, multidimensional syndrome commonly encountered in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Recently, the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS), a semistructured interview yielding a global score, and composite subscores for different domains of apathy (i.e., cognitive, behavioral, affective, self awareness), was developed and given to a sample of patients with PD in France. This study is the first outside of its original developers to examine the English language version of the LARS in PD. We found the LARS to be a coherent instrument demonstrating both convergent and divergent validity, as compared to the Apathy Scale (AS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis comparing the LARS to the AS, a validated and widely-used measure, we identified a cut-off score (sensitivity = 64%, specificity = 92%, PPV = 88%, NPV = 75%) that was higher than that proposed by the original authors, who derived their cut-off by comparing LARS global scores to clinical judgments of apathy. Although the present study does not compare the LARS to a diagnostic gold standard or promote its utility for diagnosing apathy, it provides further support for the LARS as a promising instrument to examine apathy in PD.

AB  - This article is focused on motivation and depression in later life. For about 20 years, research on the motivation of elders has underlined the importance of the cognitive evaluation of life contexts, notably in terms of self-determination. This cognitive evaluation determines the motivational orientation for daily activities (notably the levels of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation). The purpose of this research was specifically to study the relationships between the existence of four types of motivation (intrinsic, self-determined extrinsic, nonself-determined extrinsic and amotivation) and the consequences for adaptation and well-being. The study, therefore, focused on the possible links between motivation and geriatric-depression level and explored the nature of this link. Forty persons aged 60 or over (31 women: 80.48+/-9.24; nine men: 80.56+/-9.48) who live in nursing homes (20 elderly) or in their own homes (20 elderly) were enrolled. Elderly persons were assessed with specific and standardized tools: the Elderly Motivation Scale (EMS, in the French version: EMPA) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). For the statistical analyses of the results, correlations and Mann-Whitney test were used. We found that in elderly people, the motivational styles (the four types of motivation) can be reliably measured and are related to geriatric depression. First, significant positive links were noticed between intrinsic motivation and depression scores and between self-determined extrinsic motivation and depression scores. Conversely, significant negative links were noticed between nonself-determined extrinsic motivation and depression scores and between amotivation and depression scores. The most self-determined elders presented low-depression levels, whereas the more nonself-determined elders showed high-depression levels. Moreover, motivational styles significantly differed in the two groups (depressive or not depressive). The most depressive elders showed significantly lower-intrinsic and self-determined motivation levels. Our results support the hypothesis that motivational styles are related to important aspects (adaptation, well-being and depression) of the life of elderly people. Self-determination theory appears of high interest in research on aging and especially on the determinants of well-being in the elders.

AB  - AIM: We documented the number of falls and falls risk profile over two years to derive a falls risks prediction score. BACKGROUND: Simple falls risk assessment tools not requiring equipment or trained personnel may be used as a first step in the primary care setting to identify older people at risk who may be referred for further falls risk assessment in special clinics. DESIGN: Survey. METHOD: Men (n = 1941) and 1949 women aged 65 years and over living in the community were followed up for two years to document the number of falls. Information was collected regarding demography, socioeconomic status, medical history, functional limitations, lifestyle factors and psychosocial functioning. Measurements include body mass index, grip strength and stride length. Logistic regression was used to determine significant predictions of falls and to calculate predictive scores. RESULT: Twelve factors in men and nine factors in women were used to construct a risk score. The AUC of the receiver operating characteristic curve was >0.70 for both men and women and a cut off score of >or=8 gave sensitivity and specificity values between 60-78%. The factors included chronic disease, drugs, functional limitation, lifestyle, education and psychosocial factors. When applied to future predictions, only low energy level and clumsiness in both hands in men and feeling downhearted in women, were significant factors. CONCLUSIONS: A risk assessment tool with a cut off score of >or=8 developed from a two-year prospective study of falls may be used in the community setting as an initial first step for screening out those at low risk of falls. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A simple tool may be used in the community to screen out those at risk for falls, concentrating trained healthcare professionals' time on detailed falls assessment and intervention for those classified as being at risk.

T1  - Apathy: a major symptom in CADASIL
LA  - eng
SN  - 1526-632X
Y1  - 2009/03/10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The frequency and impact of apathy in subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD) remain undetermined. The frequency, clinical, neuropsychological, and imaging correlates of apathy were assessed in a large cohort of patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, a genetic model of SIVD. METHODS: Apathy was diagnosed based on Neuropsychiatric Inventory assessment. Degree of disability was assessed by modified Rankin scale, cognitive impairment by Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), autonomy by the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale, and quality of life by SEP-59 self-questionnaire. Validated imaging methods were used to determine the total burden of cerebral lesions. RESULTS: Among 132 patients, 54 (41%) were apathetic. Apathetic patients were older than nonapathetic subjects, had a lower MMSE and MDRS score, had more global disability, and were more limited in IADL. Apathetic patients were more frequently depressed compared to nonapathetic patients and more frequently presented additional neuropsychiatric symptoms. Multiple regression modeling showed a significant and independent association between apathy and a lower score of overall quality of life and between apathy and a higher load of white matter and lacunar lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that apathy is common in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), appears in association with cognitive impairment, global functional disability, and severe neuropsychiatric symptoms during the course of the disease, and can occur separately from depression. Apathy has an independent impact on the overall quality of life in CADASIL.

T1  - A scale evaluating the emotivity and well-being of elderly (Italian acronym: SVEBA): analysis of psychometric characteristics
LA  - eng
SN  - 1872-6976
Y1  - 2009
AB  - The psychopathology in the aged is an increasing burden for the last decades of the life and a large source of expenditure. An early recognition and treatment could lead to reduce personal distress and improve prognosis. For the use in the general practitioner (GP) office and ward settings most of the short check-lists available are focused on depression symptoms. For this reason a 15 items check-list, oriented to cover a wider array of symptoms, has been designed for the Italian population in the '90 (called SVEBA abbreviated from its Italian name). This work intended to investigate the presence of symptomatological clusters in order to detect different profiles of symptoms in populations with different comorbidities, in 214 home-dwelling elderly, with a mean age 80.2 years, referred to the geriatric memory clinic. We used the Keiser-Meyer-Olkin and Bartlett tests to check for applicability of factorial analysis, then a principal axis factoring extraction method was applied. The analysis identified the following factors: the first, collected items related to lack of motivation and initiative The second is related to the perceived "locus of control". The third, collected items related to sleep disturbance. The fourth, included items related to somatic complaints and anxiety. In the structure of SVEBA index is possible to identify three main symptom profiles related to motivation, anxiety and somatic symptoms and sleep disturbances.

T1  - Breast cancer patients on endocrine therapy reveal more symptoms when self-reporting than in pivotal trials: an outcome research study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1423-0232
Y1  - 2009
ET  - 2009/01/22
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this investigation was firstly to assess the overall frequency of subjectively experienced symptoms self-reported by patients receiving endocrine therapy and secondly to compare these symptoms with side effects assessed by clinicians in pivotal trials. METHODS: Unselected patients with early and advanced breast cancer receiving endocrine therapy were approached consecutively during a routine outpatient visit. They received a questionnaire called Checklist for Patients with Endocrine Therapy (C-PET), a validated self-assessment tool to determine prespecified symptoms associated with endocrine therapy. Data on toxicity were also obtained from previously published trials. RESULTS: 405 patients were approached and 373 agreed to participate in this study. Some symptoms were significantly more often recorded by the women in the adjuvant setting completing the C-PET than by physicians' reports in pivotal trials: hot flushes/sweats (C-PET 70%, ATAC 40% and BIG1-98 38%), low energy (C-PET 45%, ATAC 15% and BIG1-98 9%), fluid retention (C-PET 22% and BIG1-98 7%) and vaginal dryness (C-PET 30% and BIG1-98 3%). Similar differences were observed in the metastatic and adjuvant setting. CONCLUSIONS: A simple tool like the C-PET questionnaire is able to reflect the treatment burden of endocrine therapies and may be helpful to improve communication between patients and care providers. Some symptoms were significantly more often reported by the women in the C-PET than by physicians in pivotal trials.

T1  - The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia: a validation study with patients exhibiting early-onset dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 1545-7214
Y1  - 2009/01/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate some validity measures of Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) in patients with early-onset dementia (EOD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional design. SETTING: Nursing home. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 63 inpatients with EOD. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were assessed for the presence of clinical depression using the Provisional Diagnostic Criteria for Depression in Alzheimer Disease. Caregivers were administered the MADRS and CSDD, and two subscales from the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). RESULTS: Depressed patients had higher scores on 6 of the 10 MADRS items and on 3 of the 19 CSDD items than nondepressed patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a larger area under the curve for MADRS (0.87) than for CSDD (0.76), the difference was significant (p = 0.044). A CSDD optimal cutoff score of "5/6" yielded a sensitivity of 0.833 and a specificity of 0.567. A MADRS cutoff score of "19/20" yielded the highest sum of sensitivity (0.750) and specificity (0.843). A MADRS score of "14/15" with almost the same sum of sensitivity and specificity had a higher sum of sensitivity and a negative predictive value than "19/20." Both scales correlated with the NPI subscales depression/dysphoria (MADRS: rs = 0.70; CSDD: rs = 0.62) and apathy/indifference (MADRS: rs = 0.59; CSDD: rs = 0.50). CONCLUSION: The MADRS and CSDD performed well in distinguishing depressed from nondepressed EOD patients and showed good congruent validity. The scales may be used to assess depressive symptoms in EOD. The MADRS intensity grades may be used for development or refinement of depression scales in (early onset) dementia.

T1  - New insights in symptom assessment: the Chinese Versions of the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale Short Form (MSAS-SF) and the Condensed MSAS (CMSAS)
LA  - eng

AB  - There are very few symptom assessment instruments in Chinese. We present the validity and reliability of the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale Short Form (MSAS-SF) and the Condensed Form MSAS (CMSAS) in Chinese cancer patients. The Chinese version of the 32-item MSAS-SF, a self-report measure for assessing symptom distress and frequency in cancer patients, was administered to 256 Chinese patients with colorectal cancer at a clinical oncology outpatient unit. Highly prevalent symptoms included worrying (59%), dry mouth (54%), lack of energy (54%), feeling sad (48%), feeling irritable (48%), and pain (41%). Both the MSAS-SF and CMSAS demonstrated good validity and reliability. For the MSAS-SF subscales, Cronbach alphas ranged from 0.84 to 0.91, and for CMSAS subscales, from 0.79 to 0.87. Moderate-to-high correlations of MSAS-SF and CMSAS subscales with appropriate European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 subscales (0.42-0.71, Ps<0.001) indicated acceptable convergent validity. Low correlations with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem and Optimism Scale (0.22, P<0.001) indicated divergent validity. MSAS subscales varied as expected with other Chinese scales--the Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ) and the Life Orientation Scale. Construct validity of both MSAS versions was demonstrated by effective differentiation between clinically distinct patient groups (Karnofsky scores <80% vs. > or =80% [P<0.001]; no active treatment vs. active treatment [P<0.002-0.034]; CHQ-12 scores < or =4 vs. CHQ-12 scores >4 [P<0.001]). The Number of Symptoms subscale correlated appropriately with the EORTC QLQ-C30 function (-0.46 to -0.60, P<0.001) and symptom scales (0.31-0.64, P<0.001). The average time to complete the MSAS-SF was six minutes. The Chinese versions of the MSAS-SF and CMSAS are valid and practical measures. Further validation is needed for Chinese patients with other cancer types and with other symptom instruments.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This investigation examined the associations between self-reports, collateral-source reports and a clinician's diagnosis of depression in persons with cognitive impairment. METHOD: Responses on the Geriatric Depression Scale - 15 (GDS-15) from 162 participants with a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (n = 78) or Alzheimer's Dementia and a Mini-Mental State score >or=15 (n = 84) were compared with both their collateral sources' report on either the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (n = 93) and/or the collateral-source GDS-15 (n = 67), or a clinician's diagnosis of Major Depression (MD). RESULTS: Significant differences were seen between self- versus collateral-source reports of depression in these participants. Participants' reports of loss of interest (anhedonia) significantly increased the odds of disagreement with their collateral sources (OR = 3.78, 95% CI: 1.3-11.2) while reports of negative cognitions significantly decreased the odds of such a disagreement (OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.1-0.9). The symptom of anhedonia also showed the strongest association with the clinician's diagnosis of MD. CONCLUSION: A motivational symptom like loss of interest was seen to play an important role in depression experienced by those with cognitive impairment.

T1  - Patient ethnicity and perceptions of families and friends regarding depression treatment
LA  - eng
SN  - 1355-7858
SN  - 1465-3419
Y1  - 2008/11/01
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Black Americans are less likely than white Americans to seek professional treatment for depression. Whether treatment recommendations are sought and implemented by patients will be influenced by the role families and friends play in diagnostic acceptance and treatment decisions. We investigated the association of ethnicity with the perceived need for treatment of depression by family and friends of older primary care patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of 355 older adults with and without significant depressive symptoms was conducted. At the baseline visit, family and friends' ratings of apathy and need for depression treatment were obtained on 314 of the 355 patients (88% response rate) and examined according to ethnicity. Participants were interviewed using standardized measures of chronic medical conditions, functional status, and psychological status. RESULTS: Older black patients compared to older white patients were less likely to be rated as needing depression treatment by their family and friends (odds ratio (OR) = 0.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.18, 0.64]) adjusting for depressive symptoms, cognition, functional status, and other potentially influential characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that patient ethnicity may play a role in a family member's or friend's perceived need for depression treatment of older adults who present in the primary care setting. Further study of attitudes, expectations, and values of patients and family members or friends in primary care settings may help elucidate the interplay of physician, patient, and family member or friend.

T1  - Development and validation of the Cognitive Inventory of subjective distress
LA  - eng
SN  - 1099-1166
Y1  - 2008/11/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed at exploring some of the facets of psychological distress during aging, and at validating an inventory, the Cognitive Inventory of Subjective Distress (CISD) for assessing this kind of distress. METHODS: An inventory of thoughts representing distress schemas was administered to 298 elderly subjects living at home or in a center. RESULTS: Factor analyses suggested retaining 29 items. They explained 62% of the total variance and corresponded to seven distinct facets: abandonment, dependency, disengagement, fear of losing control, loss of individuality, refusal of help, and vulnerability. These dimensions turned out to be relatively independent of each other and moderately correlated with measures of depression and anxiety. The internal consistency and temporal reliability of the seven scales are good. CONCLUSION: The CISD is an original tool for assessing psychological distress. It is geared to old and very old individuals living in a center for the elderly, and its design takes the fatiguability and cognitive heterogeneity of this population into account. This inventory can also be used for psychopathological assessment and can serve as a baseline for following patients over time or in the course of therapy.

T1  - The metric properties of Zarit caregiver burden scale: validation study of a Chinese version
LA  - eng
SN  - 1546-4156
Y1  - 2008///Oct-Dec
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the Chinese version of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) as an instrument for measuring strain in Chinese caregivers of elderly people with dementia. DESIGN AND METHODS: The objective of the present study was to carry out a metric analysis of a Chinese version of ZBI using a cross-sectional study. Patients and their caregivers completed a variety of questionnaires, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). Cronbach alpha coefficient was used to assess inter-item consistency, and a split half correlation coefficient was used to determine the internal consistency of the ZBI. Correlations between the ZBI and GDS, and the ZBI and HAMA were assessed for convergent validity. Correlations of the ZBI and MMSE, the ZBI and NPI were also calculated to evaluate the possible correlation of caregiver burden with the severity of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: There were 42 patients with dementia in the study. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.89 and the split half correlation coefficient was 0.87. The mean ZBI score was 24.40+/-14.68. Item-total (corrected) correlation showed significant coefficients (rs>0.33, P<0.05) for most items. There was a significant correlation between the ZBI and GDS (rs=0.57, P<0.001), and between the ZBI and HAMA (rs=0.44, P=0.003). Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between the ZBI and NPI, the ZBI and the agitation score, the ZBI and the apathy score, and the ZBI and MMSE. CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese version of ZBI meets some of the basic reliability and validity standards required for health status measures. Further studies could lead to a better understanding of the difficulties experienced by caregivers of patients suffering from dementia in China.

T1  - Prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in mild cognitive impairment and normal cognitive aging: population-based study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1538-3636
SN  - 0003-990X
Y1  - 2008/10/
AB  - CONTEXT: Little is known about the population-based prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in MCI and normal cognitive aging in a defined population. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study derived from an ongoing population-based prospective cohort study. SETTING: The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. PARTICIPANTS: We studied a random sample of 1969 individuals without dementia from the target population of 9965 elderly persons residing in Olmsted County (Minnesota) on the prevalence date (October 1, 2004). Neuropsychiatric data were available for 319 of 329 subjects with MCI (97.0%) and 1590 of 1640 subjects with normal cognition (97.0%). Neurologic, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric data were obtained from the study participants. A classification of MCI, dementia, and normal cognitive aging was adjudicated by an expert consensus panel. Accordingly, 329 subjects were classified as having MCI and the remaining 1640 subjects were classified as having normal cognition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire score. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted after adjusting for age, sex, and educational status. By considering both the odds ratio (OR) and the frequency of a symptom, the most distinguishing features between the 2 groups were apathy (OR, 4.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.11-6.60; P < .001), agitation (3.60; 2.18-5.92; P < .001), anxiety (3.00; 2.01-4.48; P < .001), irritability 2.99; 2.11-4.22; P < .001), and depression (2.78; 2.06-3.76; P < .001). The OR was highest for delusion (8.12; 95% CI, 2.92-22.60; P < .001); however, it was rare in both subjects with MCI (11 of 319 [3.4%]) and those with normal cognition (6 of 1590 [0.4%]). Thus, the population attributable risk for delusion was only 2.62% compared with 14.60% for apathy. CONCLUSIONS: Nonpsychotic symptoms affected approximately 50% of subjects with MCI and 25% of subjects with normal cognition. In contrast, psychotic symptoms were rare.

T1  - Who copes well? Obesity-related coping and its associations with shame, guilt, and weight loss
LA  - eng
SN  - 1097-4679
Y1  - 2008/10/
AB  - The relationship among weight-related coping, guilt, and shame was investigated in a sample of 98 obese German individuals over a 6-month period. In terms of the objectives, the study explored the kind and frequency of typical coping situations in which obese individuals become aware of being obese. Furthermore, the study sought to determine the predictive utility of weight-related shame and guilt concerning coping responses, and to establish whether there is an association between coping responses and weight change. A longitudinal examination over a 6-month period was chosen with two measurement points. As typical distressing coping situations, individuals reported mostly negative evaluations through others/self, physical exercise situations, or environmental hazards (mainly shopping for clothes). Weight-related shame at baseline was a significant negative predictor for problem-focused engagement coping, whereas weight-related guilt was a significant positive predictor for problem-focused engagement strategies and dietary restraint at follow-up. Although Body Mass Index showed no substantial association with the coping measures, weight loss was accompanied by a substantial drop in problem-focused disengagement coping (wishful thinking, problem avoidance). Discussion of these findings focuses on the issue of possible effects of weight-related feelings of guilt and shame on coping behavior, the link between weight loss and disengaging coping strategies, and the possible use of the findings for cognitive-behavioral therapy for obesity.

T1  - The pattern of depressive symptoms and factor analysis of the Cornell Scale among patients in Norwegian nursing homes
LA  - eng
SN  - 1099-1166
Y1  - 2008/10/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is more prevalent in subjects with dementia than in those without it. Due to both psychological and biological risk factors it is suggested that a bimodal distribution of depressive symptoms exists with higher prevalence rates being found among patients suffering both with mild and with severe dementia. AIM: To confirm or reject the hypothesis of a bimodal distribution of depressive symptoms. METHODS: A sample of 1,159 randomly selected nursing home patients was assessed using the Cornell Scale, the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) and Lawton's Scale of the activities of daily living. Additionally, information was collected from the patients' records. A factor analysis of the Cornell Scale was performed. RESULTS: The use of antidepressants and demographic characteristics, except for gender distribution, did not differ across CDR groups. Patients with dementia had more symptoms such as anxiety, irritability, agitation, retardation, loss of interest, lack of joy and delusion than those without dementia. No symptom was more frequent among non-demented subjects. The factor analysis resulted in a five factors solution: 'mood', 'cyclic', 'physical', 'retardation' and 'behavioural' factor. The score on the mood subscale did not differ across CDR groups (p = 0.326), whereas the scores on the four other subscales increased with increasing CDR scores (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We did not find a bimodal distribution of depressive symptoms. The explanation for the occurrence of the typical core symptoms of depression, the mood symptoms, is probably complex. The non-mood symptoms are probably strongly influenced by biological factors.

T1  - Unpleasant situations elicit different emotional responses in younger and older adults
LA  - eng
SN  - 0882-7974
Y1  - 2008/09/
AB  - Older adults report less distress in response to interpersonal conflicts than do younger adults, yet few researchers have examined factors that may contribute to these age differences. Emotion regulation is partially determined by the initial cognitive and emotional reactions that events elicit. The authors examined reported thoughts and emotions of younger and older adults (N = 195) while they listened to 3 different audiotaped conversations in which people were ostensibly making disparaging remarks about them. At 4 points during each scenario, the tape paused and participants engaged in a talk-aloud procedure and rated their level of anger and sadness. Findings reveal that older adults reported less anger but equal levels of sadness compared to younger adults, and their comments were judged by coders as less negative. Older adults made fewer appraisals about the people speaking on the tape and expressed less interest in learning more about their motives. Together, findings are consistent with age-related increases in processes that promote disengagement from offending situations.

T1  - The impact of symptoms and impairments on overall health in US national health data
LA  - eng
SN  - 1537-1948
SN  - 0025-7079
Y1  - 2008/09/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects on overall self-rated health of the broad range of symptoms and impairments that are routinely asked about in national surveys. DATA: We use data from adults in the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) 2002 with validation in an independent sample from MEPS 2000. METHODS: Regression analysis is used to relate impairments and symptoms to a 100-point self-rating of general health status. The effect of each impairment and symptom on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is estimated from regression coefficients, accounting for interactions between them. RESULTS: Impairments and symptoms most strongly associated with overall health include pain, self-care limitations, and having little or no energy. The most prevalent are moderate pain, severe anxiety, moderate depressive symptoms, and low energy. Effects are stable across different waves of MEPS, and questions cover a broader range of impairments and symptoms than existing health measurement instruments. CONCLUSIONS: This method makes use of the rich detail on impairments and symptoms in existing national data, quantifying their independent effects on overall health. Given the ongoing availability of these data and the shortcomings of traditional utility methods, it would be valuable to compare existing HRQOL measures to other methods, such as the one presented herein, for use in tracking population health over time.

T1  - Frailty in older Mexican-American and European-American adults: is there an ethnic disparity?
LA  - eng
SN  - 1532-5415
Y1  - 2008/09/
ET  - 2008/07/24
AB  - Because conventional frailty screening criteria have been standardized in predominantly European-American (EA) cohorts, applying them to ethnically diverse populations may result in inaccurate estimation of frailty prevalence in ethnic minorities. The objective of this study was to determine whether use of ethnic-specific criteria (EC) to characterize frailty in a bi-ethnic cohort results in significant differences in frailty prevalence when compared with the prevalence obtained using conventional criteria (CC). Data were from a random sample of community-dwelling Mexican Americans (MAs) (n=394) and EAs (n=355) aged 65 to 80 who participated in the baseline examination of the San Antonio Longitudinal Study of Aging. Frailty was defined as three or more of five characteristics: slow walking speed, weak grip strength, low energy expenditure, self-reported exhaustion, and weight loss. For CC, walking speed was standardized to height and sex, grip strength was standardized to body mass index and sex, and energy expenditure was standardized to sex using the pooled sample. For EC, these criteria were applied within each ethnic group. Frailty prevalence in MAs and EAs was compared using chi-square statistic. Using CC, a higher proportion of MAs than EAs were frail (11.3% vs 7.0%, P=.045). Using EC, there was no difference in frailty prevalence between MAs and EAs (9.9% in both ethnic groups). The application of conventional frailty screening criteria in a bi-ethnic cohort results in a higher prevalence of frailty in MAs than in EAs. In determining whether there are ethnic disparities in frailty, future studies should carefully consider whether CC or EC should be applied.

Regular smoking cessation services are almost nonexistent in China, and little is known about the psychometric properties of instruments in assessing smoking self-efficacy in Chinese, whose cultures differ greatly from those of Westerners. The present study tested the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Smoking Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SEQ-12) among 1,841 Chinese smokers who had heart disease, including (a) factorial structure using confirmatory factor analysis, (b) reliability with Cronbach's alpha, (c) concurrent validity, and (d) predictive validity of successful quitting. Confirmatory factor analysis of the SEQ-12 revealed a modified two-factor model that provided a good fit to the data; item 6 ("urge to smoke") was an indicator for the external stimuli subscale rather than for the internal stimuli subscale. Internal consistency coefficients (.77 for external stimuli and .88 for internal stimuli) were acceptable. Baseline self-efficacy scores were significantly associated positively with stage of readiness to quit, and negatively with cigarettes smoked per day and Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) score. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that successful quitting at 1 month and at 3 months were predicted by higher external stimuli score, fewer cigarettes smoked per day, lower FTND scores, and being in the intervention group. We concluded that the Chinese version of the SEQ-12 is a valid and reliable instrument for Chinese cardiac patients who smoke. The SEQ-12 can be used to assess smokers' self-efficacy so that appropriate smoking cessation interventions can be provided.

T1  - Why don't you exercise? Development of the Amotivation Toward Exercise Scale among older inactive individuals
LA  - eng
SN  - 1063-8652
Y1  - 2008/07/
AB  - This article reports on the development and initial validation of the Amotivation Toward Exercise Scale (ATES), which reflects a taxonomy of older adults' reasons to refrain from exercise. Drawing on work by Pelletier, Dion, Tuson, and Green-Demers (1999) and Legault, Green-Demers, and Pelletier (2006), these dimensions were the outcome beliefs, capacity beliefs, effort beliefs, and value amotivation beliefs toward exercise. The results supported a 4-factor correlated model that fit the data better than either a unidimensional model or a 4-factor uncorrelated model or a hierarchical model with strong internal reliability for all the subscales. Evidence also emerged for the discriminant validity of the subscale scores. Furthermore, the predictive validity of the subscale scores was supported, and satisfactory measurement invariance was demonstrated across the calibration and validation samples, supporting the generalizability of the scale's measurement properties.

T1  - Methylphenidate for the treatment of apathy in Alzheimer disease: prediction of response using dextroamphetamine challenge
LA  - eng
SN  - 0271-0749
Y1  - 2008/06/
AB  - Apathy is a common behavioral symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD), being present in up to 70% of patients. Apathy in AD and non-AD populations has been associated with dysfunction in the dopaminergic brain reward system, suggesting that pharmacotherapeutic targeting of this system may be an effective treatment for apathy in AD. We therefore performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of methylphenidate in a sample of 13 apathetic AD patients (6 men, 7 women; age mean 77.9 years [SD, 7.8 years]; Mini Mental Status Examination score, 19.9 [SD, 4.7]). Patients were treated with methylphenidate (10 mg PO twice a day) or an identical placebo in two 2-week phases separated by a 1-week placebo washout. All patients participated in a dextroamphetamine challenge test (one 10-mg oral dose) before treatment with methylphenidate to gauge the functional integrity of the dopamine brain reward system. Overall, patients demonstrated greater improvement with methylphenidate compared with placebo according to Apathy Evaluation Scale total change scores (end of treatment - baseline: Wilcoxon Z = -2.00; P = 0.047). However, a significantly greater proportion of patients experienced at least 1 adverse event with methylphenidate compared with placebo (3 vs 1; chi = 4.33, P = 0.038). Two patients experienced serious adverse events with methylphenidate, consisting of delusions, agitation, anger, irritability, and insomnia, which resolved upon discontinuation of the medication. Response to methylphenidate was associated with increases in inattention on a continuous performance task after dextroamphetamine challenge. Psychostimulants may be effective in treating features of apathy in AD, and dopaminergic changes may predict response.

T1  - Physical symptoms that predict psychiatric disorders in rural primary care adults
LA  - eng
SN  - 1365-2753
Y1  - 2008/06/
ET  - 2008/03/24
AB  - RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: There is a robust association between physical symptoms and mental distress, but recognition rates of psychiatric disorders by primary care doctors are low. We investigated patient-reported physical symptoms as predictors of concurrent psychiatric disorders in rural primary care adult outpatients. METHOD: A convenience sample of 1092 patients were assessed with a two-stage diagnostic system consisting of a brief screening questionnaire and a clinician-administered semi-structured interview that linked common physical symptoms with the concurrent presence of psychiatric disorders. RESULTS: Somatoform physical symptoms were highly predictive of the concurrent presence of a psychiatric disorder, with odds ratios ranging from 10.4 (fainting spells) to 54.6 (shortness of breath). Aggregate analysis of somatoform and non-somatoform symptoms relative to no physical symptom produced odds ratios of 3.0 or higher for headaches, chest pain, dizziness, sleep problem, shortness of breath, tired or low energy, and fainting spells. As the number of symptoms (especially somatoform) increased, the odds of a psychiatric disorder increased. CONCLUSION: Although individual physical symptoms are valid triggers for suspecting a psychiatric disorder, the most powerful correlates are total number of physical complaints and somatoform symptom status.

T1  - The Lille Apathy Rating Scale: validation of a caregiver-based version
LA  - eng
SN  - 1531-8257
Y1  - 2008/04/30
AB  - Apathy is reported in 16.5% to 70% of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Our recently developed Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) has been specifically validated for patient-based assessment of apathy in PD. The aim of the present study was to validate a caregiver-based version of the LARS. Sixty consecutive PD patients and their respective caregivers participated in the study. An informant-based version of the LARS (LARS-i) was developed to rate apathy via a caregiver-based structured interview. Apathy was also assessed in a patient-based interview using the LARS and the informant- and clinician-rated versions of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). Cronbach's alpha and standardized alpha coefficients were 0.872 and 0.877, respectively, and the split-half reliability was 0.901 (revealing good internal consistency). The test-retest and inter-rater reliability values were 0.960 and 0.996, respectively. Criterion-related validity (according to an independent, expert diagnosis) was good. Scores on the LARS and the LARS-i were highly correlated. However, apathy was rated significantly more severely by the caregiver than by the patient. This difference was significantly higher for demented than nondemented PD patients. The LARS-i was seen to have excellent psychometric properties and appears to be valid for use in PD with respect to the patient-based LARS and the informant- and clinician-rated versions of the AES.

T1  - Efficacy of music therapy in the treatment of behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 1546-4156
Y1  - 2008///Apr-Jun
AB  - BACKGROUND: Music therapy (MT) has been proposed as valid approach for behavioral and psychologic symptoms (BPSD) of dementia. However, studies demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To assess MT effectiveness in reducing BPSD in subjects with dementia. METHOD: Fifty-nine persons with dementia were enrolled in this study. All of them underwent a multidimensional assessment including Mini Mental State Examination, Barthel Index and Neuropsychiatry Inventory at enrollment and after 8, 16, and 20 weeks. Subjects were randomly assigned to experimental (n=30) or control (n=29) group. The MT sessions were evaluated with standardized criteria. The experimental group received 30 MT sessions (16 wk of treatment), whereas the control group received educational support or entertainment activities. RESULTS: NPI total score significantly decreased in the experimental group at 8th, 16th, and 20th weeks (interaction time x group: F3,165=5.06, P=0.002). Specific BPSD (ie, delusions, agitation, anxiety, apathy, irritability, aberrant motor activity, and night-time disturbances) significantly improved. The empathetic relationship and the patients' active participation in the MT approach, also improved in the experimental group. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that MT is effective to reduce BPSD in patients with moderate-severe dementia.

AB  - Participants in psychogeriatric day care differ in their ability to enjoy the activities and to be engaged in the day care program. In order to reveal individual differences in the quality of participant engagement, an 18-item questionnaire was drafted and completed for 126 visitors of a psychogeriatric day care centre. Scalability of the items was tested according to criteria of nonparametric item response theory (IRT). Construct validity was determined by comparing the results with independent behaviour ratings of cognitive impairment and apathy, and scores on the Amsterdam Dementia Screening Test (ADS), a neuropsychological test of multiple cognitive domains. Nine items formed a strong primary Participation Scale with a coefficient H of 0.63. Behaviour ratings of cognitive impairment and apathy were significant predictors of the participation score. The same was true for the subtests Design Copying and Category Fluency of the ADS. Two meaningful small secondary scales were found, representing motivation and emotional stability, which add to the predominantly cognitive content of the primary scale. Total scores of the secondary scales correlated with affective parameters, but not with cognitive indices. The Participation Scale deserves to be expanded with items referring to motivation and emotional experience.

T1  - Reliability of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) for patients with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers
LA  - eng
SN  - 1041-6102
Y1  - 2008/04/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioral symptoms and caregivers' responses may differ among various ethnic and cultural groups. Therefore it is important to have a reliable instrument to assess behavioral disturbances of dementia in various cultures. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) has been widely used in many countries. To date there has been no reliability study of this instrument in Brazil. METHODS: The psychometric properties of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the NPI were studied in a sample of 36 Alzheimer's disease (AD) outpatients from southern Brazil. Test-retest, inter-rater reliability and internal consistency were estimated. The profile of neuropsychiatric symptoms and caregiver distress were also evaluated. The NPI was translated into Portuguese and then back translated to English. RESULTS: The Brazilian Portuguese version of the NPI showed good inter-rater and test-retest reliability with the coefficients of all scales > 0.85. Internal consistency was also good (Cronbach's alpha 0.70 for total severity and distress). Apathy provided higher NPI scores of total severity and distress. CONCLUSIONS: This NPI version was found to be a reliable instrument for the evaluation of neuropsychiatric symptoms and caregiver distress due to dementia in AD. The profile of behavioral disturbances was similar to that observed in other countries. Severity of dementia may have biased some caregivers' answers.

T1  - Unmet needs of gynaecological cancer survivors: implications for developing community support services
LA  - eng
SN  - 1099-1611
Y1  - 2008/04/
AB  - After treatment completion, gynaecological cancer survivors may face long-term challenges and late effects, specific to this disease. Available research on supportive care needs of women with gynaecological cancer is limited. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and correlates of unmet needs within a population of gynaecological cancer survivors. Eight hundred and two women participated in a population-based mail survey in 2004 (56% response rate). The questionnaire included a validated instrument to assess 45 need items across multiple supportive care domains, and a range of measures to evaluate related correlates consistent with a social-ecological perspective. Forty-three per cent of respondents reported having at least one moderate- or high-level unmet need. The five highest included needing help with fear about the cancer spreading (17%), concerns about the worries of those close to them (15%), uncertainty about the future (14%), lack of energy/tiredness (14%), and not being able to do things they used to do (14%). Subgroups of women with higher odds of reporting 'some' unmet needs across multiple supportive care domains include those who, are not in remission, live with lymphoedema or are unable to work due to illness. Odds were also higher for women who had undergone more recent treatment, and who lived in rural or remote locations. Further assistance with the top specific concerns of gynaecological cancer survivors is recommended. Identified subgroups with higher needs are important targets for support.

T1  - Apathy in late-life depression among Taiwanese patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 1041-6102
Y1  - 2008/04/
ET  - 2007/07/26
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is defined as lack of motivation and occurs in a variety of neuropsychological disorders. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) has been shown to be valid and reliable for assessing apathy in depression but the validity and reliability of the Chinese version has never been examined. The aims of the study were to (1) evaluate the validity and reliability of the Chinese version of the AES in late-life depression and (2) evaluate the severity of apathy in late-life depression. METHODS: We translated the AES into Chinese and used a cross-sectional design to evaluate apathy in elderly subjects. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) -IV criteria and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) were applied for diagnosis and assessment. Three groups of subjects were recruited including one group (n = 31) of patients with major depressive disorder with current depression, the second group (n = 30) with major depressed disorder with remission, and the third group (n = 31) of healthy controls. Convergent validity was tested using four apathy-related items from the HDRS (loss of interest, psychomotor retardation, loss of energy, and loss of insight). Multiple forms of reliability (including internal consistency, test-retest, and interrater) and discriminant validity were examined. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the internal consistency (coefficient alpha = 0.90) and test-retest reliability (p < 0.001) were satisfied. Discriminant validity of apathy severity among these three groups was significant. The convergent validity and correlation coefficients based on the four apathy-related items from the HDRS and AES were acceptable. CONCLUSION: Apathy is a distinct syndrome which may be treatable when depression is effective managed. Further application of the Chinese version of the AES to study the association of apathy with other neuropsychological symptoms is necessary.

T1  - Behavioural problems in Huntington's disease using the Problem Behaviours Assessment
LA  - eng
SN  - 0163-8343
Y1  - 2008///Mar-Apr
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate behavioural problems in Huntington's disease (HD). METHOD: In 152 HD mutation carriers and a control group of 56 noncarriers at initial 50% risk, the Dutch version of the Problem Behaviours Assessment (PBA) was administered. Mutation carriers were divided into three groups according to the motor section of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS): pre-(motor) symptomatic, early and advanced symptomatic subjects. The factor structure and interrater reliability of the PBA were investigated. RESULTS: The clinically relevant interrater reliability of the PBA was 0.82 for severity scores and 0.73 for frequency scores. The PBA showed a three-factor solution: apathy, depression and irritability. Mutation carriers, including presymptomatic subjects, portrayed more apathy, depression and irritability than noncarriers. Early symptomatic subjects had more apathy, but not more depression or irritability, compared to presymptomatic subjects. Advanced symptomatic subjects had more apathy than early symptomatic subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The PBA is a reliable and sensitive instrument. Behavioural problems occur in all stages of HD and arise before the onset of motor symptoms. Apathy is related to disease severity, whereas depression and irritability are not. The broad clinical phenotype of HD therefore requires adequate service delivery with integrated and multidisciplinary patient care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is defined as an important loss of motivation in all domains of daily functioning. Especially in old age, apathy might be a specific neuropsychiatric syndrome separate from depression. There are indications that apathy in elderly subjects is related to vascular disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relation between vascular disease and apathy in subjects aged 85 years and older. METHODS: The Leiden 85-plus Study is a prospective, population-based study of 500 elderly subjects. Vascular disease including myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or myocardial ischemia, claudicatio intermittens, and arterial surgery was determined at baseline. Symptoms of apathy were assessed annually from age 85 through 90 years using the apathy questions of the 15-item Geriatric Depression Rating Scale (GDS). Diagnostic accuracy of the apathy questions was validated using the Apathy Scale at age 90 years. The association between vascular disease and apathy was estimated both at baseline and longitudinally. RESULTS: The apathy items of the GDS showed a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 85%. At baseline, 69 subjects with apathy but free of depression had significantly more cardiovascular pathologies compared to 287 subjects without apathy. In the 287 subjects who were free of apathy and depression, increase of apathy but not depression during follow-up was significantly higher for each additional cardiovascular pathology at baseline. CONCLUSION: In community dwelling elderly, those with vascular disease were at higher risk of developing apathy but not depression. This suggests that apathy and depression in old age have different etiologies.

Y1  - 2008/02/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are nearly universal in dementia, yet little is known about their longitudinal course in the community. OBJECTIVE: To estimate point and 5-year period prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in an incident sample of 408 dementia participants from the Cache County Study. METHODS: The Neuropsychiatric Inventory assessed symptoms at baseline and at 1.5 years, 3.0 years, 4.1 years, and 5.3 years. Point prevalence, period prevalence and mean symptom severity at each time point were estimated. RESULTS: Point prevalence for delusions was 18% at baseline and 34-38% during the last three visits; hallucinations, 10% at baseline and 19-24% subsequently; agitation/aggression fluctuated between 13% and 24%; depression 29% at baseline and 41-47% subsequently; apathy increased from 20% at baseline to 51% at 5.3 years; elation never rose above 1%; anxiety 14% at baseline and 24-32% subsequently; disinhibition fluctuated between 2% and 15%; irritability between 17% and 27%; aberrant motor behavior gradually increased from 7% at baseline to 29% at 5.3 years. Point prevalence for any symptom was 56% at baseline and 76-87% subsequently. Five-year period prevalence was greatest for depression (77%), apathy (71%), and anxiety (62%); lowest for elation (6%), and disinhibition (31%). Ninety-seven percent experienced at least one symptom. Symptom severity was consistently highest for apathy. CONCLUSIONS: Participants were most likely to develop depression, apathy, or anxiety, and least likely to develop elation or disinhibition. Give converging evidence that syndromal definitions may more accurately capture neuropsychiatric co-morbidity in dementia, future efforts to validate such syndromes are warranted.

T1  - Patient and caregiver perspectives of quality of life in dementia. An investigation of the relationship to behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 1421-9824
Y1  - 2008
ET  - 2008/08/04
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Behavioural and psychological symptoms have a high prevalence amongst patients with dementia and can be a significant source of distress to both patients and carers. The present study explored the relationships between quality of life and behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD) from both patient and carer perspectives. Contextual factors surrounding the occurrence of BPSD were explored. METHODS: Forty-six patients and 116 carers completed questionnaire measures of BPSD and quality of life. RESULTS: BPSD were negatively associated with both patient and carer ratings of patient quality of life. The symptoms related to lower quality of life differed between patient and carer ratings: depression and irritability were found to predict lower carer ratings of quality of life, whilst delusions and apathy indicated lower patient ratings. Carers were found to be poor at identifying antecedents and consequences of BPSD. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of BPSD is associated with lower quality of life in dementia. Interventions designed to improve the quality of life for patients should focus on the BPSD specifically associated with the patient's rating of quality of life. Information regarding the role of contextual factors in behaviour management should be made available to carers.

T1  - An open-label pilot study of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to promote functional recovery in elderly cognitively impaired stroke patients

AB  - BACKGROUND: Impairments in cognition and motivation are common after stroke and predict poor functional recovery. Pharmacological agents that enhance cognition and/or diminish apathy may, when combined with traditional rehabilitative efforts, improve functional recovery. We investigated the feasibility of using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in older patients with acute post-stroke cognitive impairment and examined their effects on functional recovery. METHODS: This 12-week open-label study prospectively treated ischemic stroke survivors aged > or =60 years who were undergoing inpatient rehabilitation and who had cognitive impairment in one or more domains (memory, attention or executive function). Participants received galantamine (maximum dose 24 mg/day) or donepezil (maximum dose 10 mg/day). Physical function was assessed using the Functional Independence Measure-motor subscale (FIM-motor); participants' functional gains were compared to those of a matched historical comparator group. Changes in cognition and apathy were also assessed. Since donepezil and galantamine have different pharmacologic profiles, they were examined separately. RESULTS: Forty participants started study medication; 14 participants terminated prematurely. Donepezil-treated participants experienced a 14-point greater improvement in the FIM-motor score compared to either galantamine-treated participants or the historical comparator group (repeated measures mixed model, group x time interaction p < 0.0001). Change in apathy, but not in cognition, was also associated with change in the FIM-motor score. CONCLUSIONS: In this open-label study, participants receiving donepezil had better functional recovery than participants receiving galantamine or the historical comparators. This improvement may reflect efficacy at the starting dose for donepezil but not galantamine. A randomized trial is in progress.

T1  - Dementia Care Mapping-Japanese version(DCM-J) as a research evaluation method for measuring quality of life among elderly patients with dementia: reliability and validity of Well-being and Ill-being value
LA  - jpn
SN  - 0300-9173
Y1  - 2008/01/
AB  - AIM: Dementia Care Mapping is a behavior evaluation tool that can be used to measure and improve the quality of life of elderly patients with dementia. However, the reliability and validity of the Dementia Care Mapping-Japanese version (DCM-J) has not yet been established. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to clarify the reliability and validity of the Well-being and Ill-being (WIB) value of the DCM-J as a method for evaluating quality of life. METHODS: The study was conducted from April 1, 2005 to June 30, 2006. The participants included 130 elderly patients (men 31, women 99, average age 82.65+/-7.69 years) who were given a diagnosis of dementia. We established inter-rater reliability during a parallel observation method and also used test-retest for reliability. The correlation between the WIB value of the DCM-J and the Japanese Quality of Life Inventory for Elderly with Dementia (QOL-D) was used to establish criterion-related validity. RESULTS: Forty-nine (37.7%) subjects were given a diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer's type, 80 (61.5%) had vascular dementia and 1 (0.8%) had dementia with Lewy bodies. The results showed correlation between the WIB value and social withdrawal measured by the behavioral category code (BCC) on the DCM-J and the three subscales of QOL-D: "interacting with surroundings", "expressing self", and "experiencing minimum negative behaviors". There was good internal consistency among these items. The interclass correlation coefficient was 82.32 (+/-5.85) for the WIB value of the DCM-J. The correlation coefficient of the retest, administered one week later, was 0.836 (p=0.001). The WIB value was significantly correlated with three sub-scales of QOL-D, and the correlation coefficient was greater than 0.53. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the WIB value of the DCM-J has good inter-rater reliability and test re-test reliability and criterion-related validity. In this study, the WIB value was shown to have similar reliability to the WIB value of the original DCM. Furthermore, our results suggest that the DCM-J could be useful for evaluating quality of life among elderly Japanese patients with dementia.

T1  - Beyond the "C" in MCI: noncognitive symptoms in amnestic and non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment
LA  - eng
SN  - 1092-8529
Y1  - 2008/01/
AB  - INTRODUCTION: How frequent and how clinically important are mood and behavioral symptoms among older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)? Although these noncognitive behavioral symptoms (NCBS) are not represented in the diagnostic criteria for MCI, their clinical significance is increasingly recognized. METHODS: To address this question, the authors identified a cohort of consecutively evaluated patients from a psychiatric hospital's outpatient memory clinic. These patients' records contained both a clinical assessment and a standardized set of evaluations including the Mini-Mental State Exam, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Using a standardized chart-review approach, the presence of any NPI-screened symptom was identified and the frequencies of specific NPI-screened symptoms were calculated for the Memory Clinic MCI cohort and for amnestic and non-amnestic MCI subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 116 patient records were reviewed. Thirty-eight patients with MCI were identified. Twenty-two of these met criteria for amnestic MCI by Mayo Clinic criteria while 16 met criteria for non-amnestic MCI. At least one NPI-screened mood or behavioral symptom was present in 86.8% of these MCI patients. Depression/dysphoria (63.3%), apathy (60.5%), anxiety (47.4%), irritability (44.7%), and nighttime behaviors (42.1%) were the most frequent. While depression/dysphoria was distributed similarly between amnestic and non-amnestic subgroups, apathy was significantly more frequently associated with the amnestic subtype of MCI, and nighttime behaviors were more frequently associated with the non-amnestic subtype. CONCLUSION: Although the presence of NCBS is not required for a diagnosis of MCI, these symptoms are frequently present and constitute an important source of morbidity. Apathy and depression may be difficult to differentiate, but targeted treatment of depression may fail to address apathy. Recognizing the limitations of this preliminary study, the authors suggest that apathy may be more characteristic of amnestic MCI while nighttime behaviors may be more characteristic of non-amnestic MCI.

T1  - Relationship between measures of dementia severity and observation of daily life functioning as measured with the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS)
LA  - eng
SN  - 1421-9824
Y1  - 2008
ET  - 2007/11/28
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is mostly regarded as the core symptom of dementia, but several other domains (such as daily functioning) are equally relevant to assess the severity of dementia. The relationship between these domains is unclear. The Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS) is a relatively unexplored instrument in people with dementia, measuring severity by direct observation. OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between the AMPS and scores on several commonly used outcome measures for the assessment of dementia severity, and to examine the possible influence of neuropsychiatric symptoms on these relationships in patients with cognitive disorders. METHODS: Cross-sectional data of 118 patients with cognitive disorders were used; data on cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE; CAMCOG), global severity (Global Deterioration Scale, GDS), daily life functioning (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, IADL), and neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, NPI) were collected and analyzed using correlation and regression analyses. Different combinations of the severity measures were tested for their ability to predict the AMPS process ability scores. RESULTS: Scores on the MMSE, CAMCOG and GDS were moderately associated with the AMPS process ability score. These measures explained between 27 and 44% of the variance in the AMPS score. The presence of apathy influenced the association between the cognitive measures and the AMPS score. CONCLUSION: Commonly used measures of dementia severity are only moderately associated with observation of performance on daily activities. This underlines the need for direct observation of daily activities in dementia patients. This relationship between several approaches of assessing dementia severity needs further study.

AB  - We examined the validity of the motivation/initiative item of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) section I as a screening and diagnostic measure for apathy in Parkinson's disease (PD). Fifty-eight patients with PD were evaluated with the UPDRS, the 14-item Apathy Scale (AS), and standardized rating scales of depression and cognitive impairment. Apathy was diagnosed using specific items of the AS together with proposed criteria for apathy. A score of 2 or more on the motivation/initiative item was adequate to screen for apathy, whereas a score of 4 had high diagnostic accuracy at the cost of unacceptable low sensitivity.

T1  - Two dimensions of anosognosia in patients with Alzheimer's disease: reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the Anosognosia Questionnaire for Dementia (AQ-D)
LA  - eng
SN  - 1323-1316
Y1  - 2007/12/
AB  - Although a number of studies have examined anosognosia of cognitive deficits in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), not much is known about the anosognosia of behavioral symptoms in AD. The aims of the present study were to establish a Japanese version of the Anosognosia Questionnaire-Dementia (AQ-D) and to examine its factor structure, reliability and validity, and to identify the effects of various variables on the AQ-D. Factor structure, internal consistency, test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of the Japanese version of the AQ-D were analyzed. Multiple regression was then done using the results of the AQ-D as dependent variables and entering all relevant predictor variables. Both the internal consistency and the test-retest reliability of the AQ-D were excellent. Factor analysis indicated four factors: anosognosia of basic and instrumental activities of daily living; that of episodic memory and orientation; that of disinhibited behaviors; and that of apathy and depression. The first two factors were regarded as anosognosia of cognitive deficits and were associated with Mini-Mental State Examination scores, while the latter two factors were regarded as anosognosia of behavioral symptoms and were associated with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score. A dissociation between the two domains of anosognosia was confirmed, namely of cognitive deficits and of behavioral symptoms using the Japanese version of the AQ-D. The knowledge that various factors may have different effects on different domains of anosognosia in patients with AD may serve as useful information for clinicians assessing anosognosia in AD.

T1  - Geriatric Pain Measure short form: development and initial evaluation
LA  - eng
SN  - 1532-5415
Y1  - 2007/12/
ET  - 2007/11/20
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate a short form of the 24-item Geriatric Pain Measure (GPM) for use in community-dwelling older adults. DESIGN: Derivation and validation of a 12-item version of the GPM in a European and an independent U.S. sample of community-dwelling older adults. SETTING: Three community-dwelling sites in London, United Kingdom; Hamburg, Germany; Solothurn, Switzerland; and two ambulatory geriatrics clinics in Los Angeles, California. PARTICIPANTS: European sample: 1,059 community-dwelling older persons from three sites (London, UK; Hamburg, Germany; Solothurn, Switzerland); validation sample: 50 persons from Los Angeles, California, ambulatory geriatric clinics. MEASUREMENTS: Multidimensional questionnaire including self-reported demographic and clinical information. RESULTS: Based on item-to-total scale correlations in the European sample, 11 of 24 GPM items were selected for inclusion in the short form. One additional item (pain-related sleep problems) was included based on clinical relevance. In the validation sample, the Cronbach alpha of GPM-12 was 0.92 (individual subscale range 0.77-0.92), and the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between GPM-12 and the original GPM was 0.98. The correlation between the GPM-12 and the McGill Pain Questionnaire was 0.63 (P<.001), similar to the correlation between the original GPM and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (Pearson r=0.63; P<.001). Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the GPM-12 covers three subfactors (pain intensity, pain with ambulation, disengagement because of pain). CONCLUSION: The GPM-12 demonstrated good validity and reliability in these European and U.S. populations of older adults. Despite its brevity, the GPM-12 captures the multidimensional nature of pain in three subscales. The self-administered GPM-12 may be useful in the clinical assessment process and management of pain and in pain-related research in older persons.

T1  - A neuropsychological longitudinal study in Parkinson's patients with and without hallucinations
LA  - eng
SN  - 0885-3185
Y1  - 2007/12/
AB  - The aim of this work was to determine the progression of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with or without hallucinations. Two years after the first assessment, 36 PD patients were re-evaluated on standardized neuropsychological tests, including the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and on rating scales for overall cognitive functioning, functional autonomy, behavioral disorders. Nine patients had hallucinations at baseline and endpoint assessments; 12 patients developed hallucinations during the follow-up; and 15 patients were hallucination-free throughout the study. Cognitive performance significantly declined in all three groups, but at endpoint assessment PD hallucinators scored significantly lower than nonhallucinators on phonological and semantic fluency tasks, immediate free recall and the go/no-go FAB subtest; moreover, they showed more severe apathy than nonhallucinators. Reduced phonological fluency at baseline (odds ratio [OR], 13.5; 95% CI: 1.34-135.98, P = 0.027) was the only independent predictor of onset of hallucinations after 2 years, whereas hallucinations (OR, 10.1; 95% CI: 1.94-51.54, P = 0.006) and poor phonological fluency (OR, 6.1; 95% CI: 1.04-35.03, P = 0.045) independently predicted development of diffuse cognitive impairment. We concluded that reduced verbal fluency scores may predict the onset of hallucinations, while hallucinations and poor phonological fluency may predict development of dementia in PD patients.

T1  - The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale: validation study of the mentation, behavior, and mood section
LA  - eng
SN  - 0885-3185
Y1  - 2007/11/15
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the validity of the mentation, behavior, and mood items included in Part I of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and to assess its usefulness to screen for dementia, psychosis, depression, and apathy. A consecutive series of 168 patients with PD were assessed by neurologists with the UPDRS, and by psychiatrists using a comprehensive neuropsychiatric evaluation blind to each other's ratings. ROC analysis demonstrated that a score of 2 or greater on the intellectual impairment item of the UPDRS had 60% sensitivity and 92% specificity to detect dementia, as diagnosed with DSM-IV criteria. When a score of 23 or lower on the MMSE was included as an additional classification variable, the sensitivity increased to 85%. A score of 2 or greater on the thought disorder item had 43% sensitivity and 92% specificity to detect psychotic symptoms (delusions or hallucinations). A score of 2 or greater on the depression item had 77% sensitivity and 82% specificity to detect major depression as diagnosed with DSM-IV criteria. Finally, a score of 2 or greater on the motivation/initiative item had 73% sensitivity and 65% specificity to detect apathy, as diagnosed with a standardized criteria. When the sample was divided into mild (i.e. Hohen-Yahr stages I and II) versus moderate-severe PD (i.e. Hohen-Yahr stages III-V), findings remained unchanged, except that the UPDRS show unacceptably low accuracy to detect psychosis in mild PD. The mentation, behavior, and mood section of the UPDRS is an adequate screen for depression and apathy, and has adequate sensitivity to detect dementia when combined with the Mini-Mental State Exam, but has low sensitivity to detect psychosis.

T1  - Gender differences in the symptoms of major depressive disorder
LA  - eng
SN  - 1539-736X
Y1  - 2007/11/
AB  - Data from the Canadian Community Health Survey 1.2 were used for a gender analysis of individual symptoms and overall rates of depression in the preceding 12 months. Major depressive disorder was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview in this national, cross-sectional survey. The female to male ratio of major depressive disorder prevalence was 1.64:1, with n = 1766 having experienced depression (men 668, women 1098). Women reported statistically more depressive symptoms than men (p < 0.001). Depressed women were more likely to report "increased appetite" (15.5% vs. 10.7%), being "often in tears" (82.6% vs. 44.0%), "loss of interest" (86.9% vs. 81.1%), and "thoughts of death" (70.3% vs. 63.4%). No significant gender differences were found for the remaining symptoms. The data are interpreted against women's greater tendency to cry and to restrict food intake when not depressed. The question is raised whether these items preferentially bias assessment of gender differences in depression, particularly in nonclinic samples.

T1  - Recognizing apathy in Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1936-5764
Y1  - 2007/11/
AB  - Apathy has been increasingly recognized as a neuropsychiatric symptom in many neurologic disorders. In this paper, we review the clinical features of apathy in Alzheimer's disease. We also review screening, the differential diagnosis including depression, medical illnesses, and mild cognitive impairment, and treating modalities and issues. It must also be recognized that apathy per se almost never occurs as an isolated syndrome, so it must be viewed in the context of an individual's entire behavioral and cognitive status.

T1  - Quality of life in dementia: care recipient and caregiver perceptions of quality of life in dementia: the LASER-AD study
LA  - eng
SN  - 0885-6230
Y1  - 2007/10/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality of Life (QoL) is a key outcome in dementia. AIM: To compare care recipients' (CR) and caregivers' (CG) views on CRs' QoL and identify determinants. METHODS: CRs and CGs completed the Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) scale. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-one CR/CG dyads were interviewed. There were differences between determinants of the CRs and CGs views about QoL. Family-CGs rated CRs' QoL higher when CRs had fewer depressive symptoms, less irritability, less apathy, less daily living impairment and lived at home. Fewer depressive symptoms, living at home and taking acetylcholinesterase-inhibitors (AChEI) predicted higher CR rated QoL. CONCLUSION: Proxy ratings in dementia do not replicate CRs' views of QoL. This is the first study to employ a validated QoL measure for people with dementia taking AChEIs. Randomised controlled trials are needed before drawing conclusions about their effect on QoL. Interpretation of correlations between QoL and symptoms should be cautious as QoL is designed to reflect the impact of psychological and physical symptoms.

T1  - Reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX) in Alzheimer's disease: validation of a behavioral rating scale to assess dysexecutive symptoms in Japanese patients with Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 0885-6230
Y1  - 2007/10/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both executive cognitive dysfunction and behavioral problems contribute to dysexecutive symptoms in daily life. The aim of the present study was to develop a behavior rating scale for assessing dysexecutive symptoms in Japanese patients with AD. METHOD: The Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX), devised by Burgess et al. (1998), was used to evaluate 122 Japanese patients with AD. The factor structure, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity of the Japanese version of the DEX were then examined. RESULTS: The Japanese version of the DEX demonstrated a good internal reliability and a good test-retest reliability. Factor analysis revealed three factors that were named 'apathy', 'hyperactivity' and 'planning and monitoring process of the purposive action'. The 'apathy' factor of the DEX was significantly correlated with the 'apathy' score of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), while 'planning and monitoring process' factor of the DEX was significantly correlated with the total score of the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and the 'hyperactivity' factor of the DEX was significantly correlated with the 'aggression', 'euphoria' and 'disinhibition' scores of the NPI. CONCLUSIONS: The Japanese DEX is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing executive dysfunction conveniently in real life situations of AD patients. While two factors, 'apathy' and 'hyperactivity', were associated with emotional and behavioral changes, the 'planning and monitoring process' was associated with the cognitive executive function in the patients with AD. These findings suggest that both a neuropsychiatric syndrome and cognitive function contribute to the dysexecutive symptoms experienced by AD patients in daily life.

T1  - Withdrawal, apathy and lack of vigor in late life depression: factorial validity and relationship to diagnosis
LA  - eng
SN  - 1360-7863
Y1  - 2007/09/
AB  - Withdrawal, apathy and lack of vigor (WAV) describe a pattern of lack of vitality and dropping of interests and activities in later life, which may or may not indicate depression. This study examines (a) whether the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) contains a measure of this symptom cluster, and if so, (b) whether the presence of WAV leads to more false positive predictions by the GDS. A total of 444 Chinese older persons responded to the GDS and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and were independently assessed by psychiatrists for depression and other diagnoses. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that six WAV symptoms formed a distinct cluster on the GDS. WAV was positively correlated with age and MMSE but most other symptom clusters measured on the GDS were not. Nonetheless, the ROC curves were essentially the same, regardless of whether the WAV items were included or not. Further analysis revealed that the optimal cutoff for the GDS without WAV produced fewer false positives, but also missed more true cases, than the full scale. The extent to which false positives become an issue depends on the specific threshold chosen (which entails a tradeoff with sensitivity) rather than the presence of WAV items.

T1  - Symptoms of dementia among adults with Down's syndrome: a qualitative study
LA  - eng
SN  - 0964-2633
Y1  - 2007/09/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dementia is common among adults with Down's syndrome (DS); yet the diagnosis of dementia, particularly in its early stage, can be difficult in this population. One possible reason for this may be the different clinical manifestation of dementia among people with intellectual disabilities. AIMS: The aim of this study was to map out the carers' perspective of symptoms of dementia among adults with DS in order to inform the development of an informant-rated screening questionnaire. METHOD: Unconstrained information from carers of people with DS and dementia regarding the symptoms, particularly the early symptoms of dementia, was gathered using a qualitative methodology. Carers of 24 adults with DS and dementia were interviewed. The interviews were recorded and fully transcribed. The transcripts were then analysed using qualitative software. RESULTS: There appeared to be many similarities in the clinical presentation of dementia in adults with DS and the non-intellectually disabled general population. Like in the non-intellectually disabled general population, forgetfulness especially, impairment of recent memory combined with a relatively intact distant memory and confusion were common, and presented early in dementia among adults with DS. However, many 'frontal lobe'-related symptoms that are usually manifested later in the process of dementia among the general population were common at an early stage of dementia among adults with DS. A general slowness including slowness in activities and speech, other language problems, loss of interest in activities, social withdrawal, balance problems, sleep problems, loss of pre-existing skills along with the emergence of emotional and behaviour problems were common among adults with DS in our study. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the similarities in the clinical presentation of dementia among the general population and people with DS with a particular emphasis on the earlier appearance of symptoms associated with the frontal lobe dysfunction among adults with DS.

T1  - Coping with recurrent breast cancer: predictors of distressing symptoms and health-related quality of life
LA  - eng
SN  - 0885-3924
Y1  - 2007/07/
ET  - 2007/06/04
AB  - Little is known about how postmenopausal women with recurrent breast cancer cope with distressing symptoms and which factors predict health-related quality of life (HRQOL). In the present study, 56 consecutively enrolled patients completed questionnaires measuring symptom occurrence, coping capacity, coping efforts, and HRQOL at the time of recurrence. Results from this study illustrate that women with recurrent breast cancer suffer from multiple, concurrent, and interrelated symptoms of illness, anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Highly prevalent symptoms are lack of energy, difficulty sleeping, pain, worrying, problems with sexual interest, feeling sad, and dry mouth. The most frequently occurring symptom is problem with sexual interest, and the most severe symptom is worrying. The most distressing symptom experienced is pain. The majority of the women report 10-23 symptoms. Women who experience multiple symptoms also report higher levels of symptom distress. The experience of distressing symptoms is predicted by coping capacity, and the coping efforts experienced predict HRQOL. Patients with lower coping capacity report higher prevalence of symptoms, experience higher levels of distress, and experience worse perceived health, which in turn may decrease their HRQOL. To help women manage recurrent breast cancer, it is important to use multidimensional measurement to identify, evaluate, and treat distressing symptoms, and not assess single symptoms only. Care must be based upon the awareness of critical factors that exacerbate vulnerability to distress, as well as the ability to adapt to a recurrent breast cancer disease.

T1  - Development of a short version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale specifically adapted for demented nursing home residents
LA  - eng
SN  - 1064-7481
Y1  - 2007/05/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Apathy is among the most frequent neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia, particularly Alzheimer disease. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) has been widely employed for assessing apathy in different patient groups. To further facilitate the usage of the AES, an abbreviated version was constructed. METHOD: On basis of a sample of 356 nursing home residents, a cross-validation procedure was carried out to develop a brief version of the AES. According to a thorough clinical examination, 85% of the residents were demented, 8% presented with mild cognitive impairment, whereas 7% did not present any cognitive deficits. After subdividing the patient group into two matched samples, the first subsample was used to identify problematic items due to defined psychometric and content-related criteria. The original 18-item scale was thus reduced to 10 items. Psychometric properties of the shortened version were subsequently reassessed in the second subsample. RESULTS: The short version demonstrated favorable psychometric properties that could be confirmed by cross-validation with the second sample. Correlations with the original full-length version were high (r = 0.97 for both subsamples); the shortened scale yielded no substantial losses regarding internal consistency or construct validity (correlations with the respective subscales of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory). CONCLUSION: The frequency of apathetic symptoms in the nursing home residents included confirms the clinical importance of apathy for understanding dementia. Given this specific patient population, setting, and mode of data collection, the short-version AES seems to be a valuable and time-efficient instrument for assessing apathy.

T1  - Clinical and psychometric distinction of frontotemporal and Alzheimer dementias
LA  - eng
SN  - 0003-9942
Y1  - 2007/04/
AB  - BACKGROUND: A proportion of patients who meet the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Associations criteria for Alzheimer disease (AD) have frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) confirmed at autopsy, with or without concomitant AD. Thus, the clinical phenotypes of the 2 disorders may overlap. OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical and psychometric indicators that distinguish AD from FTLD at initial presentation. DESIGN: Longitudinal study of memory and aging. SETTING: Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Washington University School of Medicine. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight clinically well-characterized cases of autopsy-confirmed FTLD (27 with psychometric testing results) were compared with 27 autopsy-confirmed AD cases. RESULTS: Behavioral abnormalities, particularly impulsivity (P<.001), disinhibition (P<.001), social withdrawal (P = .01), and progressive nonfluent aphasia, distinguished individuals with FTLD from those with AD. The individuals with FTLD performed better than those with AD on a visual test of episodic memory (P = .01), but worse on word fluency (P = .02) (performance correlated with aphasic features). Other cognitive and clinical features, including executive dysfunction and memory impairment, were comparable between the FTLD and AD groups. Concomitant histopathological AD was present in 11 of the 48 individuals with FTLD. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and cognitive features of FTLD may overlap with AD, although behavioral and language difficulties distinguish those with FTLD. Memory loss in those with FTLD may in part reflect word-finding difficulties stemming from language dysfunction. Compounding the overlap of FTLD and AD clinical phenotypes is the presence of histopathological AD in almost one fourth of individuals with FTLD.

T1  - Screening for depression among patients with multiple sclerosis: two questions may be enough
LA  - eng
SN  - 1352-4585
Y1  - 2007/03/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is common and has a significant impact on quality of life. As many as two-thirds of depressed MS patients receive no treatment for their depression. While guidelines for depression management suggest screening, the only validated screening tools are questionnaires, which have not been widely implemented in practice. This is the first study on the effectiveness of using two questions assessing mood and anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure) in screening for major depressive disorder (MDD) in MS. METHODS: MS patients under the care of neurologists were recruited from a large health maintenance organization (HMO). The MDD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV and screening questions was administered. RESULTS: Of the 260 participants, 26% met the criteria for MDD. Among patients with MDD, 67% received no anti-depressant medication. The MDD screen identified 99% (95% CI: 91-100%) of cases. DISCUSSION: A brief, two question screen is reliable in identifying MS patients with MDD. This suggests that asking these two brief questions could identify almost all MS patients meeting MDD criteria, with minimal numbers of false positives.

T1  - Premorbid personality and behavioral and psychological symptoms in probable Alzheimer disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1064-7481
Y1  - 2007/03/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous research investigating the influence of premorbid personality on behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD) has produced mixed findings. Addressing some limitations of previous studies, the authors aimed to investigate whether some of the common individual symptoms of BPSD (depression, anxiety, irritability, and aggression) were associated with key aspects of previous personality (neuroticism and agreeableness); and also to perform an exploratory investigation into the broader influence of personality factors on behavioral and psychological syndromes. METHODS: Two hundred eight patients with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer disease were assessed for the presence of BPSD over the disease course using the caregiver-rated Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). One or two knowledgeable informants rated patients' midlife personalities using a retrospective version of the NEO-FFI questionnaire. RESULTS: Premorbid neuroticism was correlated with anxiety and total NPI score, although not with depression. Premorbid agreeableness was negatively correlated with agitation and irritability. Principal components analysis of the 10 NPI behavioral domains identified three syndromes: "agitation/apathy," "psychosis," and "affect." In stepwise linear regression analyses, including personality domains from the Five-Factor Model and a range of potential confounders as independent variables; the only significant personality predictor of a behavioral syndrome was "agitation/apathy," predicted by lower premorbid agreeableness. CONCLUSION: Lower premorbid agreeableness is associated with agitation and irritability symptoms in Alzheimer disease and also predicts an "agitation/apathy" syndrome. The relationship between premorbid neuroticism and BPSD is less straightforward, and premorbid neuroticism does not appear to be associated with depression in Alzheimer disease or predict an "affect" syndrome.

T1  - Clinically defined vascular depression in the general population
LA  - eng
SN  - 0033-2917
Y1  - 2007/03/
ET  - 2006/11/01
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular depression is regarded as a subtype of depression, especially in, but not entirely restricted to, the elderly, characterized by a specific clinical presentation and an association with (cerebro)vascular risk and disease. It could have major implications for treatment if subjects at risk for such a depression could be easily identified by their clinical presentation in general practice. METHOD: We studied the symptom profile of depression in subjects with and without vascular risk factors in two large Dutch community-based studies, the Rotterdam Study and the Amsterdam Study of the Elderly (AMSTEL). RESULTS: We could not confirm the specific symptom profile in depressed subjects with vascular risk factors in either of the two cohorts. Depressed subjects with vascular risk factors showed more loss of energy and more physical disability than those without vascular risk factors. However, presumed specific symptoms of vascular depression, namely psychomotor retardation and anhedonia, were not significantly associated with any of the vascular risk indicators. Loss of energy was significantly associated with myocardial infarction and peripheral arterial disease. CONCLUSIONS: In these two large community-based studies we identified some differences between vascular and non-vascular depressed subjects but found no evidence for a specific symptom profile of vascular depression as previously defined.

T1  - Socioeconomic differences in adolescent stress: the role of psychological resources
LA  - eng
SN  - 1879-1972
SN  - 1054-139X
Y1  - 2007/02/
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate whether psychological resources influenced the association between parent education (PE), a marker of socioeconomic status (SES), and perceived stress. METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses were conducted in a sample of 1167 non-Hispanic black and white junior and senior high school students from a Midwestern public school district in 2002-2003. Hierarchical multivariable regression analyses examined relationships between PE (high school graduate or less = E1, > high school, < college = E2, college graduate = E3, and professional degree = E4), and psychological resources (optimism and coping style) on teens' perceived stress. Greater optimism and adaptive coping were hypothesized to influence (i.e., mediate or moderate) the relationship between higher PE and lower stress. RESULTS: Relative to adolescents from families with a professionally educated parent, adolescents with lower parent education had higher perceived stress (E3 beta = 1.70, p < .01, E2 beta = 1.94, p < .01, E1 beta = 3.19, p < .0001). Both psychological resources were associated with stress: higher optimism (beta = -.58, p < .0001) and engagement coping (beta = -.19, p < .0001) were associated with less stress and higher disengagement coping was associated with more stress (beta = .09, p < .01). Adding optimism to the regression model attenuated the effect of SES by nearly 30%, suggesting that optimism partially mediates the inverse SES-stress relationship. Mediation was confirmed using a Sobel test (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents from families with lower parent education are less optimistic than teens from more educated families. This pessimism may be a mechanism through which lower SES increases stress in adolescence.

T1  - Behavioral correlates of GABAergic disruption in Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1041-6102
Y1  - 2007/02/
ET  - 2006/07/27
AB  - BACKGROUND: Losses of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) have been variably demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may be related to the presence of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in AD. Our objective was to assess the relationship between plasma GABA (pGABA) levels and specific BPSD in patients with severe AD. METHODS: pGABA levels and BPSD were measured in 14 institutionalized AD patients (8M/6F, mean age +/- S.D. = 85.6 +/- 4.5 years) with severe cognitive impairment (Mini-mental State Examination score = 4.5 +/- 4.6) and prominent behavioral disturbances (Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score = 33.4 +/- 23.6). RESULTS: pGABA was positively correlated with depression and apathy scores on the NPI and negatively correlated with age. Apathy and age were independent predictors of pGABA levels. CONCLUSIONS: The final stages of AD are associated with GABAergic changes, which may contribute to depression and apathy in AD.

T1  - An appraisal of the psychometric properties of the Clinician version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-C)
LA  - eng

SN  - 1557-0657
Y1  - 2007
AB  - This article examines the psychometric properties of the clinician version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-C) to determine its ability to characterize, quantify and differentiate apathy. Critical appraisals of the item-reduction processes, effectiveness of the administration, coding and scoring procedures, and the reliability and validity of the scale were carried out. For training, administration and rating of the AES-C, clearer guidelines, including a more standardized list of verbal and non-verbal apathetic cues, are needed. There is evidence of high internal consistency for the scale across studies. In addition, the original study reported good test-retest and inter-rater reliability coefficients. However, there is a lack of replication on these more stable and informative measures of reliability and as such they warrant further investigation. The research evidence confirms that the AES-C shows good discriminant, convergent and criterion validity. However, evidence of its predictive validity is limited. As this aspect of validity refers to the scale's ability to predict future outcomes, which is important for treatment and rehabilitation planning, further assessment of the predictive validity of the AES-C is needed. In conclusion, the AES-C is a reliable and valid measure for the characterization and quantification of apathy.

T1  - The psychometric properties of the Swedish Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory MFI-20 in four different populations
LA  - eng
SN  - 0284-186X
Y1  - 2007
AB  - The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) scale is widely used for measuring fatigue in cancer care. This questionnaire has been translated into Swedish and used in Swedish cancer populations, and the aim of this study was to test the validity and reliability of the Swedish version in four populations, with a total of 584 patients. The participants were classified into four groups: palliative cancer patients, cancer patients receiving radiation therapy, non-cancer outpatients, and a group of hospital staff. The MFI-20 consists of five subscales of fatigue: General Fatigue (GF), Physical Fatigue (PF), Reduced Motivation (RM), Reduced Activity (RA) and Mental Fatigue (MF). We have tested the convergent validity of the MFI-20 using the Category Ratio instrument (CR-10). The validity and the reliability of MFI-20 were acceptable. All subscales of the MFI-20 were correlated, and all were also correlated with the CR-10 score (p < or = 0.001). General Fatigue was highly correlated with Physical Fatigue for the three patient groups, but this was not the fact for healthy staff. Deleting some items increased Cronbach's alpha of the subscale to which these items belonged (where alpha measures the reliability of the results). The level of non-response was low (less than 1.2%) and there was no pattern to the items omitted. We conclude that the MFI-20 is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring fatigue in patients and in healthy individuals. The results support, to some extent, earlier findings and one item can be removed from the Swedish version of the MFI-20.

T1  - Validation therapy (VT) in nursing home: a case-control study
LA  - eng
SN  - 0167-4943
Y1  - 2007
AB  - VT is a method for communicating with elderly people with dementia. It has been applied since 2001 at the "Istituto Giovanni XXIII" in Bologna, a public trust, housing over 500 not self-sufficient elderly people. Around 75% of these subjects suffer from cognitive impairment, associated to behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in over 35%. To assess the effectiveness of VT, we carried out a study involving 50 subjects divided in two groups, of cases and controls, made up by 27 and 23 patients, respectively. In both groups neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) and the Bedford Alzheimer nursing severity scale (BANSS) were used before the start and after the end of the study; the case group underwent both individual and group VT. The results show a marked decrease of the average NPI symptom score in the case group (from 22.0 to 9.5) vs. a rise in the control group (from 21.7 to 24.1). Agitation, apathy, irritability and nighttime behaviors were the most improved NPI items among the subjects who underwent the VT. In these patients also the NPI distress score turned out reduced, vs. a small increase in the control group. In the case group an improvement occurred with BANSS too, even if much slighter changes were registered vs. the control group. Although the small number of subjects enlisted does not allow to draw firm inferences, the study suggests that VT is able to reduce the severity and frequency of BPSD, thus improving the relationship with and the management of patients having diagnosis of dementia without any side effects.

LA  - eng
SN  - 0895-0172
Y1  - 2007///Winter
AB  - The psychometric properties of the clinician, informant, and self-rated versions of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-C/I/S) were examined using data on 121 outpatients seen in a behavioral neurology clinic for the assessment of dementia and associated neuropsychiatric disorders. Two factors, apathy and interest, were identified for the AES-C and the AES-I. The AES-S had only an apathy factor. The AES-C was found to have fairly good psychometric properties. However, from a diagnostic point of view, the AES-I provided the greatest sensitivity and the strongest positive and negative predictive values. Generally, the AES-S performed poorly compared with the AES-C and AES-I.

T1  - Short-term stability of diagnoses of major and minor depression in older medical inpatients
LA  - eng
SN  - 0033-3182
Y1  - 2007///Jan-Feb
AB  - The authors sought to determine the short-term stability of diagnoses of major and minor depression in older medical inpatients. The investigation was a test-retest design involving comparisons between different pairs of interviewers who assessed patients independently on medical wards of two acute-care, university-affiliated hospitals by use of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) at intervals between 1 and 51 days. Patients were 380 cognitively-intact patients age > or =65, assessed twice with the DIS. Core depressive symptoms (depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure) were more stable than the other depressive symptoms. The presence of moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms, moderate-to-severe disability, and depression symptoms of > or =6 months' duration were associated with a higher short-term stability of diagnosis. Age, gender, language, education, rater, interval between assessments, baseline number of medications, medical comorbidity, severity of medical illness, acute physiology score, and cognitive functioning were not associated with short-term depression stability. Stability of diagnosis may be improved by emphasis on core depressive symptoms or the presence of more severe depressive symptoms, moderate-to-severe disability, and duration of symptoms > or =6 months.

T1  - Psychometric properties of a German version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale
TT  - Die Apathy Evaluation Scale: Erste Ergebnisse zu den psychometrischen Eigenschaften einer deutschsprachigen Ubersetzung der Skala
LA  - ger
SN  - 0720-4299

AB  - Apathy is a common feature of a variety of different psychiatric, neurological, and medical disorders. It can be defined as lack of motivation affecting cognitive, emotional, and overt behavioural aspects. Despite being associated with other clinical disorders, apathy can also occur as an independent syndrome (e. g., after brain injuries), now depicting a primary loss of motivation. However, apathy is predominantly assessed within the scope of superordinate psychiatric disorders. As a syndrome-independent scale, the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) claims to assess levels of apathy in different disorders. The aim of the present study is to provide German speaking researchers with an authorized German translation of the AES (AES (D)). The scale was evaluated in a sample of 217 subjects, consisting of patients suffering from dementia (n=120), remission-phase schizophrenia (n=20), Parkinson's disease (n=12), stroke (n=28), as well as elderly healthy controls (n=37). Preliminary results concerning the factorial structure, item characteristics, reliability, and construct validity demonstrate favourable statistical properties and suggest that the AESD is comparable to its original. The scale seems well-suited to detect apathy in different clinical groups. Differences between informant sources (clinician interview, self-, and informant ratings) seem to be related to the severity of symptoms or expert practice.

T1  - Impact of androgen deprivation therapy on physical and cognitive function, as well as quality of life of patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer
LA  - eng
SN  - 0022-5347
Y1  - 2006/12/
AB  - PURPOSE: Many patients with prostate cancer receive androgen deprivation therapy for long periods. We compared physical and cognitive function, and quality of life in a cross-sectional study of 57 patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer and 51 healthy age matched controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Physical and daily function were measured by the 6-minute walk test, grip strength, the timed up and go test, and activities of daily living measures. Cognitive function was evaluated by the High Sensitivity Cognitive Screen and by a self-report prototype Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy cognitive function subscale. Quality of life was assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General with the subscale for fatigue and by the Patient-Oriented Prostate Utility Scale. RESULTS: Androgen deprivation therapy was given for a median of 1.8 years (range 0.4 to 7.4). Patients had lower median hemoglobin than controls (134 vs 148 gm/l, p <0.0001). Performance on physical tests was similar in the 2 groups. Moderate or severe cognitive impairment by the High Sensitivity Cognitive Screen was similar for patients (23%) and controls (35%, p = 0.2). Self-reported cognitive dysfunction was also similar. Scores for the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General were similar but the Patient Oriented Prostate Utility Scale summary score was worse for patients (median 71 vs 86, p <0.001). More patients reported severe fatigue (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue score less than 35, p = 0.03). Low energy, poor bladder control and loss of sexual function were reported in 36%, 47% and 95% of patients, and in 16%, 34% and 33% of controls, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy experience more symptoms and have worse fatigue than controls, but this study did not detect any effect on physical or cognitive function.

T1  - Promoting enhanced patient and family caregiver congruence on lung cancer symptom experiences
LA  - eng
SN  - 1538-0688
Y1  - 2006/11/03
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To test the effects of different perspective-taking instructional sets, gender, caregivers' personal histories with cancer, and caregiving relationship factors on family caregiver and patient perceptual agreement of symptom experiences of patients with lung cancer. DESIGN: Counterbalanced. SETTING: Thoracic oncology outpatient clinical setting in Canada. SAMPLE: 98 dyads consisting of patients with lung cancer and their family caregivers. METHODS: Data were collected on a one-time basis by employing an abbreviated version of the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale targeting lack of energy and worrying. Caregivers were randomized to one of six counterbalanced conditions of perspective-taking instructions. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Caregiver discrepancy scores, instructional sets (i.e., neutral, self-report, and imagine-self and imagine-patient perspective-taking), order effects, gender, caregivers' personal history with cancer, and caregiving relationship factors. FINDINGS: No order effects were found for the instructional sets. Instructions to imagine the patient's perspective over imagining how the caregiver would feel if he or she had cancer were most effective in enhancing the caregiver's ability to estimate the patient's lack of energy and worrying. Gender had no significant effects. The amount of patient-caregiver communication had a positive impact on the accuracy of caregivers' perspectives. CONCLUSIONS: The patient-oriented instructions had a limited impact on enhancing patient-caregiver congruence on patient symptoms. This likely is related to the study's convenience sample of caregivers who appear to naturally engage in empathic processes of patient-oriented perspective-taking when they assessed and reported on patient symptom conditions. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Further exploratory work should identify interpersonal conditions that negatively hamper the effects of caregiver perspective-taking on their reasonable understanding of patient symptoms.

T1  - Depression in acute stroke
LA  - eng
SN  - 1180-4882
SN  - 1488-2434
Y1  - 2006/11/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Depression is one of the most frequent neuropsychiatric disturbances in stroke patients. The clinical aspects and correlations of depression in the first days after acute stroke are less known. This study aimed to 1) assess the frequency of depression, 2) describe the profile of depression of stroke patients and 3) analyze the relation between depression and demographic, predisposing and precipitating conditions, and clinical and imaging data, in acute stroke patients. METHODS: We used the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale to assess depression in 178 consecutive acute (<or= 4 days) stroke (26 subarachnoid hemorrhage, 31 intracerebral hemorrhage, 121 cerebral infarct) patients (mean age 57 yr) and in a control group of 50 acute coronary patients (mean age 59 yr). RESULTS: Eighty-two patients (46%) presented acute depression; apathy/loss of interest was the most frequent clinical feature. In logistic regression, the best model to predict depression (backward model) identified previous mood disorder (odds ratio 2.2-12.9) as an independent predictor. There were no significant differences in the frequency or severity (p > 0.45) of depression between control subjects and acute stroke patients. CONCLUSIONS: Depression was present in almost one-half of the acute stroke patients and was related to previous mood disorder but not not to stroke type or location. Apathy/loss of interest was the predominant clinical feature.

T1  - ADCS Prevention Instrument Project: behavioral measures in primary prevention trials
LA  - eng
SN  - 0893-0341
Y1  - 2006///Oct-Dec
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for the development of inexpensive, reliable, and valid instruments that can be used in large-scale primary prevention trials of compounds aimed at ameliorating progression from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease. The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study launched a Prevention Instrument Project to develop such methodologies. Behavioral changes are common in diseases causing dementia and may occur prior to a point when cognitive changes are sufficiently severe to allow diagnosis of a dementia syndrome. Experimental behavioral measures were included in the protocol to examine this hypothesis. METHODS: Six hundred forty-four individuals with CDR 0 or 0.5 were randomly assigned to receive a brief in-clinic behavioral assessment or telephonic administration of the same assessment. The questions were asked to the individual and their research partner. The Prevention Instrument Project included behavioral measures of depression, anxiety, irritability, and apathy. RESULTS: All measures demonstrated acceptable test-retest reliability at 3-month intervals except for the single-item depression screen by the subjects' research partner. Behavioral changes are significantly more common among patients with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores of 0.5 compared with CDR scores of 0. Behavioral alterations including irritability, anxiety, and apathy are more common among ethnic minorities than among the White population. Depression, irritability, anxiety, and apathy are significantly correlated with each other. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral changes are common among those with mild degrees of cognitive compromise (CDR 0.5). Telephonic assessment of behavioral changes is feasible. The predictive value of these alterations for progression to Alzheimer disease or other dementias will be assessed longitudinally.

T1  - Improvement in the health-related quality-of-life symptoms of hyperparathyroidism is durable on long-term follow-up
LA  - eng
SN  - 0039-6060
Y1  - 2006/10/
ET  - 2006/08/30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subjective symptoms such as decreased energy, chronic fatigue, and depression are associated with hyperparathyroidism. Studies have shown that these symptoms are improved during short-term follow-up after parathyroidectomy. This study evaluates the durability of this subjective improvement in quality-of-life symptoms in a large population of patients with follow-up greater than 1 year after operation. METHODS: Between 2002 and 2005, 258 patients underwent parathyroidectomy, 100 (81 females and 19 males) of whom were available for this study. The patients were evaluated with a survey based on the Health Outcomes Institute Health Status Questionnaire. Some answers were quantified on a 1 to 6 scale, while others consisted of "yes" or "no" responses. Patients completed a questionnaire prior to parathyroidectomy and postoperatively at 1 month, 3 to 6 months, and 1 to 2 years or greater intervals. Statistical analysis was used to detect changes attributable to parathyroidectomy. A P value <.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: At 1-month follow-up, patients' perceptions of their overall health, energy level, and mood significantly improved. At 6-month follow-up, significant improvements in muscle strength, health, endurance, and relief of anxiety were documented. At the interval of 1 to 2 years, overall health, energy level, endurance, and relief of anxiety were improved. There was no significant decrement in the quality of life in these patients after parathyroidectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Parathyroidectomy for hyperparathyroidism is associated with significant lasting improvement in subjective symptoms. The potential durable improvement in these quality-of-life symptoms is a valid indication for parathyroidectomy.

Y1  - 2006/09/
ET  - 2006/06/20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although a reduced quality of life (QoL) has been reported after long-term cure of functioning pituitary adenomas, the effect of successful treatment of nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenoma (NFMA) on QoL has not been fully addressed. Therefore, we evaluated a broad spectrum of QoL parameters in patients successfully treated for NFMA in our center. DESIGN: We conducted a case-control study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed QoL in 99 adult patients (mean age, 61.9 yr; range, 24-86 yr) in remission during long-term follow-up after surgical (n = 99) and additional radiotherapeutic (n = 37) treatment for NFMA by four validated health-related questionnaires (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Multidimensional Fatigue Index, Nottingham Health Profile, and Short Form-36). Patient outcomes were compared with 125 controls and with age-adjusted reference values derived from the literature. RESULTS: NFMA patients reported significantly impaired QoL in all questionnaires compared with the 125 controls and the age-adjusted reference values. All subscales of fatigue, assessed using the Multidimensional Fatigue Index (general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduction in activity, reduction in motivation, and mental fatigue) were impaired. The scores in the Nottingham Health Profile pointed toward reduced energy and affected emotional reaction. In several subscales of the Short Form-36 (social functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, role limitations due to emotional problems, and general health perception), NFMA patients reported a reduced QoL. CONCLUSION: QoL is considerably reduced in patients after successful treatment of NFMA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: First degree relatives of patients with colorectal carcinoma are at a higher risk of having the disease than the general population. Therefore, they should be subjected to screening colonoscopy. AIM: To assess the effectiveness of colonoscopy among first degree relatives of patients with colorectal carcinoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A free colonoscopy was offered to first degree relatives of patients operated on for colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2000. As inclusion criteria, subjects had to be asymptomatic, older than 40 years or less than 10 years younger than the index case. Each subject was contacted twice, inviting him/her to have a colonoscopy performed. RESULTS: Two hundred forty three relatives were contacted for the study and in 76, a colonoscopy was performed. Among the latter, a neoplasm was found in 13 (17%): One adenocarcinoma and 12 adenomas. Three of these lesions were located in the right colon. The main reason given by the 176 subjects that did not agree to have a colonoscopy was lack of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Screening colonoscopy is effective to detect adenoma and adenocarcinoma among first degree relatives of patients with colorectal carcinoma, however only 31% of all potential relatives agreed to undergo a colonoscopy.

T1  - Correlation between the Overactive Bladder questionnaire (OAB-q) and urodynamic data of Parkinson disease patients affected by neurogenic detrusor overactivity during antimuscarinic treatment
LA  - eng
SN  - 0362-5664
Y1  - 2006///Jul-Aug
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Parkinson disease (PD) patients present urinary symptoms during the course of the disease, very often suggestive of overactive bladder and sustained by neurogenic detrusor overactivity. These symptoms cause a severe lowering of quality of life determining social withdrawal and they need to be early diagnosed to restore social interaction and prevent urinary tract complications. Today overactive bladder diagnosis is easier, thanks to the availability of new investigative tools, particularly voiding questionnaires. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reliability of the Overactive Bladder screener (OAB screener/OAB-questionnaire), a new voiding questionnaire specifically developed for the overactive bladder diagnosis in PD subjects suffering from overactive bladder symptoms. Clinical data obtained by the questionnaire were compared with urodynamic outcomes, at basal conditions and after antimuscarinic treatment, to better explorate the questionnaire reliability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty PD patients have been enrolled in the protocol, and submitted to the OAB screener, voiding diary and urodynamic investigation before and after antimuscarinic treatment. OAB-score and urodynamic parameters were statistically analyzed and compared. RESULTS: The OAB-q well correlated with voiding diary and urodynamic data of Parkinson subjects either at baseline or after the antimuscarinic treatment. The study suggests that this clinical tool might be used for neurogenic overactive bladder diagnosis and that it seems to be a useful outcome measure for treatments of neurogenic OAB.

T1  - International multicenter pilot study of the first comprehensive self-completed nonmotor symptoms questionnaire for Parkinson's disease: the NMSQuest study
LA  - eng
SN  - 0885-3185
Y1  - 2006/07/
AB  - Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) of Parkinson's disease (PD) are not well recognized in clinical practice, either in primary or in secondary care, and are frequently missed during routine consultations. There is no single instrument (questionnaire or scale) that enables a comprehensive assessment of the range of NMS in PD both for the identification of problems and for the measurement of outcome. Against this background, a multidisciplinary group of experts, including patient group representatives, has developed an NMS screening questionnaire comprising 30 items. This instrument does not provide an overall score of disability and is not a graded or rating instrument. Instead, it is a screening tool designed to draw attention to the presence of NMS and initiate further investigation. In this article, we present the results from an international pilot study assessing feasibility, validity, and acceptability of a nonmotor questionnaire (NMSQuest). Data from 123 PD patients and 96 controls were analyzed. NMS were highly significantly more prevalent in PD compared to controls (PD NMS, median = 9.0, mean = 9.5 vs. control NMS, median = 5.5, mean = 4.0; Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and t test, P < 0.0001), with PD patients reporting at least 10 different NMS on average per patient. In PD, NMS were highly significantly more prevalent across all disease stages and the number of symptoms correlated significantly with advancing disease and duration of disease. Furthermore, frequently, problems such as diplopia, dribbling, apathy, blues, taste and smell problems were never previously disclosed to the health professionals.

T1  - Risk factors for specific upper limb disorders as compared with non-specific upper limb pain: assessing the utility of a structured examination schedule
LA  - eng
SN  - 0962-7480
Y1  - 2006/06/
ET  - 2006/04/20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few community-based epidemiological investigations of upper limb disorders (ULDs) have classified cases by validated procedures involving a structured clinical examination. AIM: To compare risk factor profiles for different diagnostic categories of ULD using one such examination scheme. METHODS: A questionnaire about upper limb pain and demographic, occupational and psychosocial risk factors was mailed to 10,264 adults from two English general practices, followed by standardized physical examination in those with arm or neck pain. Logistic regression was used to compare those with specific ULDs and non-specific arm pain with those who had no neck or arm symptoms. RESULTS: There was a 59% response rate. A total of 1,197 subjects with arm or neck pain underwent standardized physical examination and were classified as having one or more of 11 specific ULDs or non-specific regional pain. Among these, 250 subjects with specific ULDs and 176 with only non-specific arm pain were compared with 2,248 subjects who had no neck or arm symptoms. Certain physical risk factors were more strongly associated with specific disorders than with non-specific pain. In comparison with pain-free subjects, the odds ratios (ORs) in keyboard users (>or=1 h versus <1 h/day) were 3.1 (95% CI 1.3, 7.8) for hand-wrist tendonitis but 1.3 (0.8, 2.1) for non-specific hand-wrist pain. Other differential associations were found with age, sex, manual versus non-manual employment and smoking. Unexpectedly, low vitality was similarly associated with both specific disorders and non-specific pain. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the schedule may usefully distinguish disorders that differ in their association with physical risk factors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the earliest symptoms of anosognosia in people with Alzheimer's disease and to validate a criteria-guided strategy to diagnose anosognosia in dementia. METHODS: A consecutive series of 750 patients with very mild or probable Alzheimer's disease attending a memory clinic, as well as their respective care givers, was assessed using a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation. RESULTS: The factors of anosognosia for (1) basic activities of daily living (bADL), (2) instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), (3) depression and (4) disinhibition were produced by a principal component analysis on the differential scores (ie, caregiver score minus patient score) on the anosognosia questionnaire for dementia. A discrepancy of two or more points in the anosognosia-iADL factor was found to have a high sensitivity and specificity to identify clinically diagnosed anosognosia in people with Alzheimer's disease. By logistic regression analysis, the severity of dementia and apathy were both shown to be noticeably associated with anosognosia in people with Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: Anosognosia in those with Alzheimer's disease is manifested as poor awareness of deficits in iADL and bADL, depressive changes and behavioural disinhibition. The frequency of anosognosia is found to increase considerably with the severity of dementia. The validity of a specific set of criteria to diagnose anosognosia in people with Alzheimer's disease was shown, which may contribute to the early identification of this condition.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer disease and cognitively impaired, nondemented elderly from a community-based sample in Brazil: prevalence and relationship with dementia severity
LA  - eng
SN  - 1064-7481
Y1  - 2006/05/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to describe the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia in Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitively impaired nondemented (CIND) subjects from a community-based Brazilian sample and to correlate these symptoms with severity of cognitive deficits. METHOD: A total of 1,563 randomly selected subjects were evaluated with the following screening tests: Mini-Mental Status Examination, Fuld Object Memory Evaluation, Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, and Activities of Daily Living-International Scale. Screen positives were submitted to a workup for dementia, physical and neurologic examination, cranial computed tomography or cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Diagnosis was made according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria. RESULTS: Sixty patients with AD, 25 CIND, and 78 healthy elderly subjects were evaluated. Informants reported that 78.33% of patients with AD had one or more neuropsychiatric symptoms. Apathy (53.33%), depression (38.33%), sleep alterations (38.33%), and anxiety (25%) were the most prevalent disturbances in AD subjects. These disturbances were more prevalent in patients with AD than in the comparison group and CIND individuals. In the CIND group, the most frequent neuropsychiatric symptoms were anxiety and sleep alterations (both with 24%) followed by depression (16%). Total NPI scores were significantly different between AD and CIND groups, AD and comparison groups, and CIND and the comparison group. Apathy was the only neuropsychiatric symptom that was significantly different between the groups divided according to the CDR being more frequent in subjects with moderate to severe dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms seem to be as common in patients living in a developing country as they are in demented patients from the developed world. Indeed, the fact that some of our results are similar to other population-based studies may suggest that cultural factors play a minor role in the emergence of these symptoms, at least in a Latin American country like Brazil.

T1  - The Lille apathy rating scale (LARS), a new instrument for detecting and quantifying apathy: validation in Parkinson's disease
LA  - eng

SN  - 1468-330X
Y1  - 2006/05/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apathy is usually defined as reduced interest and participation in various activities. It is a frequent consequence of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although various scoring methods have been proposed, there is a lack of validated, standardised instruments for detecting apathy and assessing its severity. OBJECTIVE: To develop an apathy rating scale using a structured standardised interview capable of distinguishing between the condition's various features. METHODS: The Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) is based on a structured interview. It includes 33 items, divided into nine domains. Responses are scored on a dichotomous scale. The participants used to validate the scale consisted of 159 patients with probable Parkinson's disease and 58 healthy control subjects. The Marin Apathy Scale, the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale were also administered. RESULTS: Principal component analysis showed that the LARS probed a single construct which forms the root of an oblique factor structure reflecting four dimensions: intellectual curiosity, self awareness, emotion, and action initiation. The main psychometric properties of the LARS (internal consistency, inter-rater and test-retest reliability) were satisfactory. Concurrent validity was evaluated by reference to the Marin scale and to judgements provided by expert clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: Standard validity indices showed that the LARS is sensitive and capable of distinguishing between apathy and depression. As a screening tool, the scale is able to support dichotomous judgements accurately and, when greater measurement sensitivity is required, also determine the severity of apathy within a four category classification.

AB  - There are seldom studies on dietary behavior of patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). The aim of this study has been to know, by means of a previously validated questionnaire, which are the psycho-sociocultural factors that affect, and to what extent, assumption and adherence the dietary therapy while determining the degree of disease perception and several factors related with it. The study population is comprised by 81 patients from the nephrology clinic of the "12 de Octubre" Hospital of Madrid, with CRF in a pre-dialysis status. Seventy-seven point seventy-four percent answered "well" or "very well" to questions relating to disease knowledge and perception. Emotional and auto-management factors have little relevance according to 69.87% of patients. Fifty-nine point twenty-six percent feel a high level of familial support, and 35.77% alters dietary behavior when environmental conditions change. Most of the interviewees (87.65%) do not have difficulties finding the prescribed foods, and 70.37% considers their cost is not excessive. For almost half of the patients (48.76%), renal protection diet represents a variation in their dietary habits, a similar percentage expresses difficulty with elaboration. Food palatability is not a problem in 67.90% of the cases. Fifty-one point twenty-four percent does not perceive difficulty with cooking procedures. Seventy point ninety-nine percent feels support in one way or the other, by health care staff, although just 56.79% reports that the diet has not been explained to them. Only 18.51% questions the diet effectiveness as regards to their disease course. As for the gender variable, there were significant differences (p < 0.05), with a higher influence on men, in sections relating to disease knowledge, and influence of apathy and family support, the women those having the highest scores for food management, diet transgression at family meetings, and less information received about the prescribed diet. As for family support, there are significant differences only by age groups, patients aged more than 65 years being those feeling more this psychological support. The group of patients with a creatinine clearance less than 25 mL/min is the one expressing less categorically their appreciation on diet effectiveness. There are factors in which significant difficulty percentages are observed and that may induce diet transgression, in some cases without the patient being completely aware of, such as environmental changes, change in traditional habits, the degree of diet explanation, the organoleptic characteristics, and the lack of knowledge of appropriate cooking procedures. All these indicators confirm the need for enhancing nutritional education of these patients and their family environment, also showing the need for a nutritional intervention that completely supports patients in the process of adaptation and maintenance of their new dietary habit.

T1  - The measurement of social disablement and assessment of psychometric properties of the Social Behaviour Schedule (SBS-BR) in 881 Brazilian long-stay psychiatric patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 0020-7640
Y1  - 2006/03/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on the prevalence of social disablement in long-stay psychiatric patients, and the assessment of the psychometric properties of the instruments that evaluate social behaviour in this population are scarce in Brazil. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to estimate the prevalence rates of social disablement in a population of long-stay psychiatric patients from the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, and assessed the psychometric properties of the Social Behaviour Schedule (SBS). METHOD: Data were collected from a population of 881 psychiatric patients housed in the Municipal Mental Health Institute using the 21-item SBS. RESULTS: Most of the patients were women (59%), the mean age was 65.8 years (SD = 11) and the mean length of stay was 37.3 years (SD = 11.5). Of the population, 50.6% were scored as having poor self-care, 46% with little spontaneous communication, 41.1% with poor attention span, and 37.1% with underactivity. Comparing our data with international studies that used the same instrument, we found that our population was more disabled than the others, especially on the social withdrawal factor. Regarding psychometric properties, the inter-rater kappa was 0.709, the inter-informant kappa was 0.500, and the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.766. The groups of patients in the six settings of the institute presented significant statistical differences in the total score (F = 11.447, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the high rates of social disablement in this population. The precarious conditions of the institution where the patients have been living for decades and unmet individual care may have exacerbated their social disablement. Furthermore, the SBS-BR had satisfactory psychometric properties, particularly reliability, showing it to be an adequate instrument for measuring social disablement in Brazil.

T1  - A flexible item to screen for depression in inner-city minorities during palliative care symptom assessment
LA  - eng
SN  - 1064-7481
Y1  - 2006/03/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is inconsistent evidence for the validity of a single item to screen depression. In inner-city minority populations, the "yes/no" forced-response option may encourage bias, especially in elders and men, who view depression as stigmatizing or the healthcare system as untrustworthy. In contrast, an open-choice format with a category for ambivalent and missing responses could be acceptable if administered during the legitimized context of a physical symptom assessment. METHOD: Retrospective data were analyzed from 146 black and Latino inner-city patients receiving palliative care for various physical conditions. Bivariate analyses and ordinal regressions are based on the most recent comprehensive patient assessment conducted by a black female nurse and a bilingual Latina social worker. RESULTS: The depression item (no, unknown, yes) predicts pain and symptom attitude, which is more "hopeful" in older men with unknown depression status than in younger and older women with unknown depression status or no depression. CONCLUSIONS: The more "hopeful" pain and symptom attitudes by older men in the unknown category for depression suggest that depression, apathy, and resignation in older minority men may be hidden from clinicians in the absence of the open-choice depression item.

T1  - A comparison of depressive mood of older adults in a community, nursing homes, and a geriatric hospital: factor analysis of Geriatric Depression Scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 0891-9887
Y1  - 2006/03/
AB  - The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)-15 was used in 607 adults aged 65+ years living in a community, nursing homes, and a general hospital to explore characteristics of depressive mood in different care settings. Factor analysis of GDS-15 extracted 4 factors labeled unhappiness, apathy and anxiety, loss of hope and morale, and energy loss. The scale scores labeled unhappiness, apathy and anxiety, and loss of hope and morale were negatively correlated with the Barthel Index and the Mini-Mental State Examination scores. The results classified the depressive patterns into 2 types, one fitting the nursing home residents and the other fitting the hospital patients. The dominant factors of the nursing-home type were unhappiness and loss of hope and morale, and the hospital type was highly related with apathy and anxiety. The results indicate an extended utility of the GDS-15 for a deeper understanding of depressive mood in various care settings.

T1  - Gender differences in bipolar-II disorder
LA  - eng
SN  - 0940-1334
Y1  - 2006/03/
ET  - 2005/07/05
AB  - Gender differences in bipolar-II disorder (BP-II) are understudied. STUDY AIM: was to test if there were gender differences in the clinical and family history features of BP-II. METHODS: Consecutive 374 BP-II private practice outpatients were interviewed by a senior psychiatrist using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, modified to improve the detection of BP-II (by Benazzi and Akiskal 2003, J Affect Disord 73:33-38), the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Hypomania Interview Guide, and the Family History Screen. Logistic regression was used to study associations and control for confounding. Alpha level was set at 0.05; P was two-tailed. RESULTS: Females represented 67.3% of the group. The female to male ratio was independent of age. Females were more common in younger onset BP-II. Females, versus males, had significantly lower age at onset, more axis I comorbidity, atypical depressions, intra-depression hypomanic symptoms (i. e., mixed depression), and family history of suicidal behavior. On the MADRS, females had more sadness, loss of energy, loss of interest, and suicidal ideas. The symptom structure of hypomanic episodes was similar between females and males. LIMITATIONS: Single interviewer, outpatient sample, private practice study setting. DISCUSSION: Clinical differences were found between BP-II females and males. Differences were found only on the depressive pole of the disorder. However, the magnitude of the differences had not a strong clinical significance, suggesting that at present, on the basis of the variables and the population studied, there is little ground to support a female BP-II depression.

T1  - Characterizing behavioral and cognitive dysexecutive changes in progressive supranuclear palsy
LA  - eng
SN  - 0885-3185
Y1  - 2006/02/
AB  - Frontal lobe dysfunction is a prominent feature of many neurological disorders. Early diagnosis may be enhanced by establishing a profile of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional change. Traditional psychometric assessment focuses on cognitive dysfunction and fails to identify behavioral changes, particularly those associated with orbitofrontal dysfunction. We examined progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a prototypical subcortical dementia with frontal features, using commonly available neuropsychological measures and a modification of the Katz Adjustment Scale-Relatives (KAS-R), an instrument first developed to assess dysexecutive changes in head-injured patients. Executive tests identified deficits in reasoning, planning, set shifting, verbal fluency, information processing speed, and response initiation. On the KAS-R, changes in apathy, social withdrawal, and independence were observed, with little change in belligerence, social irresponsibility, uncooperativeness, obstreperousness, anxiety, and depression. The results show the potential utility of this instrument in characterizing behavioral and emotional changes associated with frontal lobe dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease.

Y1  - 2006
ET  - 2006/01/16
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the neuropsychological characteristics of patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with and without apathy. METHODS: A cohort of 245 MCI patients (mean age = 72 +/- 5.5 years; mean MMSE = 27.5 +/- 1.3) was divided into two subgroups according to their Apathy Inventory score and underwent an extensive neuropsychological battery. RESULTS: There were 94 (38.4%) patients with and 151 (61.6%) patients without apathy. At baseline the apathetic subgroup had a significantly lower total score on the free and cued selective reminding test (FCSR). Furthermore, the apathetic subgroup showed a significant deterioration in FCSR total recall score between baseline and the 1-year assessment. In conclusion, the presence of apathy in MCI patients is not associated with frontal task performance but with a higher degree of memory impairment.

T1  - Determinants of the quality of life in Alzheimer's disease patients as assessed by the Japanese version of the Quality of Life-Alzheimer's disease scale
LA  - eng

ET  - 2006/01/09
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although QOL is an important indicator to assess multiple facets of life, the QOL of Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects with impaired cognitive ability due to dementia has not yet been fully investigated. In this study, we developed the Japanese version of the Quality of Life-Alzheimer's disease (QOL-AD) scale by means of back-translation, and ascertained its reliability and validity for evaluating the quality of life in AD subjects. We also hypothesized that the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms may determine the characteristics and determinants of both the patients' and the caregivers' responses to the patients' QOL questionnaire. METHODS: We administered the QOL-AD questionnaire to subjects with mild or moderate AD (n = 140). The test-retest reliability was evaluated by the same interviewer after a month's interval. Data from the following tests were also collected to ascertain the validity of the questionnaire: Short Memory Questionnaire (SMQ), Neuropsychiatry Inventory (NPI), Hyogo Activities of Daily Living Scale (HADL) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). RESULTS: The Japanese version of the QOL-AD questionnaire demonstrated good internal reliability for both the patients' (Cronbach's alpha = 0.84) and the caregivers' responses (Cronbach's alpha = 0.82) and good test-retest reliability for both the patients' (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.84) and caregivers' reports (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.91). The concordance between the patients' self-report and the caregivers' observation was moderate (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.60). The score for the 'mood factor' (apathy, depression/dysphoria) in NPI predicted the overall QOL score as determined from both the patients' and the caregivers' responses for subjects with mild (MMSE>or=21, n = 88) and moderate (MMSE< 21, n = 52) AD. The score for the 'psychosis factor' (delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, agitation, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor activity) in NPI predicted the total QOL score as determined by the patients and the caregivers among subjects with moderate AD only. CONCLUSIONS: As hypothesized, the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms may be an important predictor of both the patients' and caregivers' responses to the patients' QOL questionnaire. QOL-AD appears to be a promising measure of the QOL of subjects with mild to moderate AD in Japan.

T1  - Delirium-O-Meter: a nurses' rating scale for monitoring delirium severity in geriatric patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 0885-6230
Y1  - 2005/12/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common psychiatric disorder in general hospital elderly patients. Several delirium screening tests exist. Few nurse based delirium severity measures are available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the Delirium-O-Meter, a new nurses' behavioural rating scale that is an efficient and sensitive measure of delirium severity. METHODS: Analysis of cross sectional and repeated assessments data. Participants were 92 elderly general hospital patients; 56 with delirium, 24 with dementia or other cognitive disturbances (no delirium) and 12 with other psychiatric disorders or no mental disorder. Measures were the Delirium-O-Meter (DOM), Delirium Rating Scale-Revised version (DRS-R-98), Delirium Observation Scale (DOS), Behavioural observation scale for geriatric inpatients (GIP) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). RESULTS: The majority of DOM items show a (near-) normal score distribution. Reliability of the DOM was high; Cronbach's alpha values ranged from 0.87-0.92; Intra Class Correlation (ICC) range was 0.84-0.91 for total scores and 0.40-0.97 for item scores. Factor analysis produced a 'Cognitive/Motivational' factor explaining almost half of variance and a smaller 'Psychotic/Behavioural' factor. The two-factor model results support the conceptual distinction between hyperactive and hypoactive delirium. DOM observations differentiated delirium from non delirium patients. DOM total scores were highly related to the DRS-R-98, DOS, MMSE and GIP apathy and cognitive sub scales, but less so to the GIP affective disturbances subscale, indicating convergent and divergent validity. Temporal difference scores calculated for DRS-R-98 and DOM assessments on subsequent days were also highly related (rho = 0.80-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: The newly constructed DOM is a brief and valid nurses' behavioural rating scale that can be useful for measuring different aspects of delirium and for efficiently monitoring delirium severity in elderly patients.

T1  - The construct of minor and major depression in Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 0002-953X
Y1  - 2005/11/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the frequency of major and minor depression in Alzheimer's disease and determined whether these types of depression have a different functional and psychopathological impact and whether there is a change in the prevalence of major and minor depression throughout the stages of Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: A consecutive series of 670 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV; specific instruments to rate the presence and severity of depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, delusions, pathological affective crying, performance of activities of daily living, and social functioning; and a standardized neuropsychological evaluation. Diagnoses of major and minor depression were generated from DSM-IV criteria. RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of the patients had major depression, 26% had minor depression, and 48% were not depressed. Major depression was significantly associated with sad mood in all three stages of the illness, although this association dropped significantly for minor depression in severe Alzheimer's disease. Both major and minor depression were significantly associated with more severe psychopathology, functional impairments, and social dysfunction. Depressive symptoms that most strongly discriminated between Alzheimer's disease patients with and without sad mood were guilty ideation, suicidal ideation, loss of energy, insomnia, weight loss, psychomotor retardation/agitation, poor concentration, and loss of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that DSM-IV criteria for major and minor depression identify clinically relevant syndromes of depression in Alzheimer's disease, mild levels of depression can produce significant functional impairment, and the severity of psychopathological and neurological impairments increases with increasing severity of depression.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with profound changes in social and emotional function. The emergence of increasingly sophisticated methods for measuring brain volume has facilitated correlation of local changes in tissue content with cognitive and behavioural changes in neurodegenerative disease. The current study examined neuroanatomical correlates of behavioural abnormalities, as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, in 148 patients with dementia using voxel-based morphometry. Of 12 behaviours examined, 4 correlated with tissue loss: apathy, disinhibition, eating disorders and aberrant motor behaviour. Increasing severity across these four behaviours was associated with tissue loss in the ventral portion of the right anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) and adjacent ventromedial superior frontal gyrus (vmSFG), the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC) more posteriorly, the right lateral middle frontal gyrus, the right caudate head, the right orbitofrontal cortex and the right anterior insula. In addition, apathy was independently associated with tissue loss in the right vmSFG, disinhibition with tissue loss in the right subgenual cingulate gyrus in the VMPC, and aberrant motor behaviour with tissue loss in the right dorsal ACC and left premotor cortex. These data strongly support the involvement of the right hemisphere in mediating social and emotional behaviour and highlight the importance of distinct regions on the medial wall of the right frontal lobe in regulating different behaviours. Furthermore, the findings underscore the utility of studying patients with dementia for understanding the neuroanatomical basis of social and emotional functions.

T1  - Alzheimer's disease and frontal variant of frontotemporal dementia-- a very brief battery for cognitive and behavioural distinction
LA  - eng
SN  - 0340-5354
Y1  - 2005/10/
ET  - 2005/05/23
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate whether a brief neuropsychological battery consisting of a limited number of cognitive tests and an evaluation of the behavioural domains intended to discriminate between frontotemporal dementia (fv-FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), constitutes a useful instrument for making a differential clinical diagnosis between these two pathologies. Nineteen fv-FTD and 39 AD patients were compared on cognitive tasks (assessing memory, executive functions, language and constructional praxis) and on the NPI behavioural assessment. A stepwise discriminant analysis was performed to identify the linear combination of cognitive and behavioural measures able to best discriminate between the two groups. One test for each of the investigated cognitive domains (Delayed Prose Recall, FAS verbal fluency, Boston naming test, Rey's Figure A Copy) and the four subscales of the Neuropsychiatry Inventory (NPI) which best differentiated between fv-FTD and AD patients (apathy, disinhibition, euphoria, aberrant motor behaviour) were used. The analysis selected Rey's Figure A Copy, FAS verbal fluency and NPI apathy subscale as the best discriminants between fv-FTD and AD patients. The final equation assigned 73.7% of the fv-FTD patients and 94.7% of the AD patients to the correct diagnostic group. A validation study conducted on a new independent sample of 11 fv-FTD and 22 AD patients confirmed the high sensitivity (82.6 %) and specificity (81.8%) of the diagnostic equation in assigning fv-FTD and AD patients to the correct dementia group. Although both cognitive and behavioural differences exist between FTD and AD, previous studies have aimed at differentiating the two pathologies by considering the two aspects separately and discriminant analyses were focused only on neuropsychological or neuropsychiatric evaluations. The present results emphasise the importance of rating both cognitive and behavioural clinical features of the two syndromes as objectively as possible to improve differential diagnostic accuracy.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia-frequency, relationship to dementia severity and comparison in Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 0022-510X
Y1  - 2005/09/15
AB  - Noncognitive behavioral and psychiatric disturbances are common in dementia and help in the clinical differentiation of the various subtypes. We studied the frequency of neuropsychiatric disturbances, their relationship to dementia severity and compared these disturbances in Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) using the 12-item Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). A total of 98 patients (AD-44, VaD-31, FTD-23) were evaluated. All subjects were community dwelling at the time of evaluation. The three groups were comparable on global dementia severity and functional ability. All patients had clinically significant scores on the NPI with apathy, irritability and agitation being very common (>90% of patients). AD and VaD patients in Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) stage 2 had significantly higher scores on the total NPI, agitation and disinhibition subscales compared to those in CDR stage 1. Mean scores in the domains of aberrant motor behavior, disinhibition and appetite/eating behavior differentiated FTD from AD and VaD. Neuropsychiatric disturbances in dementia appear to be universal with agitation, disinhibition and irritability being more frequent in the later stages. In this cohort disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior and appetite/eating disturbances could reliably differentiate AD and VaD from FTD. There were no significant differences between the neuropsychiatric profiles of AD and VaD.

LA  - eng
SN  - 1064-7481
Y1  - 2005/09/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Authors examined the temporal stability of symptoms of major and minor depression and apathy in dementia. METHODS: A consecutive sample of 65 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and depression at baseline evaluation received a follow-up psychiatric assessment that included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression an average of 17 months later. RESULTS: Half of the sample had no depression at follow-up, and showed a significant improvement in sadness, guilt, suicidal ideation, disruption in sleep, loss of interest, loss of energy, thoughts of death, social withdrawal, psychomotor changes, changes in appetite/weight, and symptoms of anxiety. No significant changes were found on scores of irritability or apathy. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates the specificity of depressive symptoms in AD and suggests that apathy and depression are different behavioral domains.

T1  - Impact of cognitive impairment on the phenomenology of geriatric depression
LA  - eng
SN  - 1064-7481
Y1  - 2005/08/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dementia and depressive syndromes demonstrate substantial symptom overlap. As a result, it is challenging to differentiate depression symptoms from nonspecific symptoms of an underlying dementia syndrome. The author addressed the impact of cognitive impairment on the phenomenology of depression symptoms by determining whether more impaired patients were more likely to endorse certain self-report depressive symptoms independent of their underlying level of depression severity. METHODS: Author used data from 576 geriatric rehabilitation inpatients for MIMIC model analyses examining the impact of cognitive impairment on both depression severity and endorsement of symptom clusters. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Geriatric Depression Scale, and cognitive impairment was measured with the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale total score. RESULTS: The reliability (internal consistency) of self-reported depressive symptoms did not change as a function of cognitive impairment. More severe cognitive impairment was associated with greater depression severity but was also associated with two depression symptom clusters after controlling for underlying levels of depression severity. Patients who were more impaired endorsed greater social withdrawal and less psychomotor agitation, independent of their underlying depression severity. Level of cognitive impairment alone did not affect the endorsement of depressed mood and positive affect. CONCLUSIONS: Certain symptoms on depression inventories may be endorsed at a greater level by cognitively impaired patients, independent of their level of underlying depression severity. These symptoms may be nonspecific features of the underlying dementia syndrome and may not be specific to depressive episodes, but instead may represent other syndromes, such as apathy.

SN  - 1468-330X
Y1  - 2005/08/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whereas apathy is increasingly recognised as a frequent abnormal behaviour in dementia, its overlap with depression remains poorly understood. AIMS: To assess the psychometric characteristics of a structured interview for apathy, and to examine the overlap between apathy and depression in dementia. METHODS: A total of 150 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) underwent a comprehensive psychiatric and cognitive assessment. RESULTS: Twelve per cent of the sample met criteria for both apathy and depression, 7% met criteria for apathy only, and 31% met criteria for depression only. Apathy (but not depression) was significantly associated with more severe cognitive deficits. Apathy and anxiety scores accounted for 65% of the variance of depression scores in dementia, and the diagnosis of apathy had a minor impact on the rating of severity of depression. CONCLUSIONS: The Structured Interview for Apathy demonstrated adequate psychometric characteristics. Using a novel structured interview for apathy in AD we demonstrated that whereas the construct of depression primarily consists of symptom clusters of apathy and anxiety, apathy is a behavioural dimension independent of depression.

T1  - Self-injurious behaviour in nursing home residents with dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 0885-6230
Y1  - 2005/07/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the phenomenology and prevalence of Self-Injurious Behaviour (SIB) in nursing home patients with dementia. METHOD: Cross-sectional study of 110 nursing home patients with dementia. Nurses' ratings of SIB and other behavioural disturbances were compared to independent resident physician ratings of medical charts data pertaining to dementia type, dementia severity, prescribed psychotropic drugs, immobility and measures to restrain the patient. Instruments used were the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS, modified), Behaviour Rating Scale for Psychogeriatric Inpatients (GIP), Rating scale for Older Patients (BOP). RESULTS: SIB was observed in 22% of the dementia patients. Pinching or scratching oneself and banging one's fist against objects were most frequently reported. Five patients showed a combination of two types of SIB. As expected, SIB was modestly related to Aimless repetitive behaviour and Aggression and no association was found between SIB and Apathy. Correlates of SIB were prescribed psychotropics (i.e. benzodiazepines), immobility and measures to restrain the patient. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data suggest that SIB is a specific psychopathological phenomenon that is highly prevalent in nursing home patients with dementia. Future research should focus on the aetiology and treatment of SIB.

T1  - Prevalence of symptoms possibly related to PADAM, in a Swedish population aged 55, 65 and 75 years
LA  - eng
SN  - 0378-5122
Y1  - 2005/03/14
AB  - OBJECTIVES: With age there is an average decline in the concentration of biologically active testosterone. It is still controversial if this leads to a clinically relevant deficit, "partial androgen deficiency of the ageing man" (PADAM). Our objective was to investigate the prevalence of a series of symptoms possibly associated with PADAM in an assumed normal-population of older men. METHODS: We developed a questionnaire including items about symptoms possibly associated with PADAM as well as background data covering demography, medical history, mood status, medication, castration therapy, as well as smoking, exercise and alcohol habits. The 10 items of the ADAM-questionnaire, designed to predict low bio-available T, were also included. The questionnaire was sent to all 1885 men 55, 65 or 75-years-old, living in Linköping, Sweden. RESULTS: We identified a number of symptoms that differed significantly (P < 0.01) between age groups, e.g., "increased abdominal circumference", "decrease in muscle strength and/or endurance", "decreased libido", "less strong erection" and "lack of energy". From factorial analysis we found that the symptoms co-varied in four different groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of a number of symptoms differed significantly between age groups, but we cannot infer that there is a causal connection between an average age-dependent decline in testosterone function and these symptoms. There are several other ways to interpret these results like the existence of concurrent somatic and/or mood disorders or ageing as such. For this purpose further studies including measurements of testosterone concentrations relating to the findings of this study have to be performed.

T1  - Use of the QOL-AD for measuring quality of life in people with severe dementia--the LASER-AD study
LA  - eng
SN  - 0002-0729
Y1  - 2005/03/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) scales are particularly important in older people as global outcome measures for interventions. It is known that people with mild to moderate dementia can provide valid assessments of their own QOL, but it is unclear whether these instruments are useful in those with severe dementia. OBJECTIVE: We examined the usefulness of the QOL scale in Alzheimer's disease (QOL-AD) in people with severe dementia by considering the ability of older people with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of <12 and their caregivers to complete this scale, as well as its construct validity and internal consistency. METHODS: Data were collected from people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers using a range of instruments measuring cognition, mood, behaviour, QOL and functional ability. RESULTS: Of 79 participants and their caregivers, 41 (52%) could complete the QOL-AD. Cognition and functional abilities were significantly higher in the completers than in the non-completers (P < 0.001). The QOL-AD showed internal consistency and construct validity as it correlated with ability to look after self, fewer limitations due to physical health, positive mood status and low levels of apathy. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence for the validity and reliability of the QOL-AD in people with MMSE scores of 3-11, as well as the practicality of administering the scale in this population. The scale is unlikely to generate useful information for people with MMSE scores of <3. QOL does not decrease as cognition worsens. This throws into question most people's assumption that decreasing cognition worsens QOL. We consider that it may be important to inform the public of this, as living wills are used increasingly in our culture.

T1  - Effects of methylphenidate on cognition and apathy in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a case study and review
LA  - eng
SN  - 0268-8697
Y1  - 2005/02/
AB  - The psychostimulant methylphenidate has been previously shown to improve cognitive performance in both normal control volunteers and patient populations. In the present case study, the effects of methylphenidate on cognitive and behavioural function were examined in a single patient with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) who had undergone ventriculoperitoneal shunting. A double-blind placebo-controlled ABBA drug design was employed, with the administration of two different doses of methylphenidate followed by neuropsychological assessment on a number of psychometric tests and cognitive tasks drawn from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Methylphenidate produced a dose-dependent positive improvement in behavioural measures in the patient associated with a reduction in apathy. It also had a dose-independent enhancing effect on performance of a Spatial Recognition task. These findings require replication in a large sample of patients to determine whether methylphenidate may prove to be generally useful in enhancing cognition and reducing apathy in normal pressure hydrocephalus.

T1  - Symptom profile of DSM-IV major and minor depressive disorders in first-ever stroke patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 1064-7481
Y1  - 2005/02/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Depressive disorders are very common in stroke patients. However, vegetative and cognitive symptoms primarily derived from brain damage could hypothetically be indistinguishable from those directly derived from neuropsychiatric disorders, and this could invalidate the diagnostic assessment. Thus, authors aimed to detect the frequency of clinically-rated DSM-IV depressive symptoms and the diagnostic validity of depressive disorders in stroke patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD), minor depressive disorder (MIND), and those free of any neuropsychiatric disorders (NODEP). METHODS: First-ever stroke patients (N=200) were approached within 3 months of the acute stroke and were interviewed with the SCID-P and administered the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Ham-D), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Barthel Index, and the Mini-Mental State Exam. RESULTS: Fifty patients (25%) had MDD, 62 (31%) had MIND, and 88 (44%) had NODEP. Global cognitive level, functional impairment, total scores, and psychic and somatic subscores of the Ham-D and the BDI were different among the three groups. The only symptom that did not differ among patients with MDD, MIND, and NODEP was Feelings of Guilt; all the other eight DSM-IV symptoms were significantly different. In particular, the frequency of Depressed Mood, Diminished Interest or Pleasure, Fatigue or Loss of Energy, Insomnia, and Psychomotor Agitation/Retardation was higher in MIND patients than in NODEP patients. CONCLUSIONS: During the diagnostic procedure for depressive disorders in stroke patients, clinicians should consider equally important vegetative, cognitive, and psychological depressive symptoms, despite their nature.

T1  - Motivational symptoms of depression mask preclinical Alzheimer's disease in elderly subjects
LA  - eng
SN  - 1420-8008
Y1  - 2005
ET  - 2004/09/21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Althoughthe relationship between depressive disorders and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is debated, there is evidence that depression may be an early symptom of dementia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate depression features prospectively in elderly subjects with a view to identifying a subgroup affected by preclinical AD. METHODS: We performed a cohort study on cognitive performances with a 12-month follow-up in out-patients referred to the local Neuropsychology Clinic complaining of memory problems. Two hundred and twenty-two consecutive non-demented subjects were studied using a neuropsychological battery and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and assessed again 1 year later for the possible onset of cognitive impairment. Multivariate analysis was performed to detect independent predictors of dementia development among age, education, neuropsychological test scores and BDI scores and subscores. BDI subscores were obtained by dividing items into three domains corresponding to mood-related, somatic and motivation-related symptoms. RESULTS: At the time of the first evaluation, 124 of the 222 subjects were depressed according to DSM-III-R criteria. At 1 year, 31 of the 124 depressed subjects and 2 non-depressed ones had AD according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. Stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that the subjects who went on to develop dementia had significantly higher total BDI scores and motivational BDI subscores. Among depressed subjects, the probability of being diagnosed with dementia during follow-up was significantly associated with a motivational BDI subscore > or = 7 (odds ratio: 3,885, 95% Cl 154-97,902). COMMENT: Close neuropsychological follow-up of depressed elderly subjects complaining of memory failure and showing apathy is recommended to detect the early stage of AD.

T1  - Confirmatory factor analysis of the geriatric depression scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 0016-9013
Y1  - 2004/12/
AB  - PURPOSE: The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is widely used in clinical and research settings to screen older adults for depressive symptoms. Although several exploratory factor analytic structures have been proposed for the scale, no independent confirmation has been made available that would enable investigators to confidently identify scores for the subdimensions of depression represented in the scale. DESIGN AND METHODS: This article describes a confirmatory factor analysis of the 30-item GDS, with the factor structure based on an exploratory principal components analysis that was published earlier. The original study sample consisted of 327 community-dwelling adults aged 65-94 years. The confirmatory factor analysis was performed on data from an independent sample of 294 adults aged 60-98 years who resided in retirement facilities. RESULTS: The proposed final measurement model uses 26 of the items from the GDS in five factors and obtains a goodness-of-fit index of.90. The resulting distinct subdimensions are Dysphoric Mood, Withdrawal-Apathy-Vigor, Hopelessness, Cognitive, and Anxiety. IMPLICATIONS: Although results should be considered preliminary, the use of these five subdimensions as subscales for scoring purposes may improve the precision and utility of the GDS as an assessment tool for older adults in health, mental health, and research contexts.

T1  - Patients' perspectives on noncompliance with diabetic retinopathy standard of care guidelines
LA  - eng
SN  - 1529-1839
Y1  - 2004/11/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodic dilated eye examinations are recommended by the American Optometric Association, American Academy of Ophthalmology, and American Diabetes Association to detect sight-threatening conditions in diabetic patients. However, many patients with diabetes do not receive this recommended eye care and there is limited research to explain why. The objective of this study was to determine reasons some diabetic patients do not receive a dilated eye examination at least every year. METHODS: A chart review identified patients at The Ohio State University College of Optometry who had not been examined for more than a year, but less than two years. A telephone interview was attempted for all subjects. RESULTS: Of 100 eligible subjects, 43 completed the telephone interview. The reasons patients with diabetes did not return for a recommended dilated eye examination included transfer of care to another eye doctor, limited personal mobility due to poor overall health, last examination at a homeless clinic, self-reported lack of insurance, and self-reported apathy. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to improve compliance of patients with diabetes should include reaching patients of low socioeconomic status and those institutionalized for poor overall health. Improved compliance may also come by encouraging patients to use medical insurance for eye examinations and using patient recall systems.

T1  - The reliability of clinical and biochemical assessment in symptomatic late-onset hypogonadism: can a case be made for a 3-month therapeutic trial?
LA  - eng
SN  - 1464-4096
Y1  - 2004/11/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether testosterone (T) supplementation in men considered to have symptomatic late-onset hypogonadism (SLOH) can be evaluated clinically and biochemically. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To assess the relevance of the clinical and biochemical diagnosis of hypogonadism we investigated patients referred for the diagnosis and treatment of SLOH. Patients were assessed clinically and completed a screening questionnaire. The pituitary-adrenal-gonadal axis was comprehensively assessed biochemically. Those with a clinical diagnosis of hypogonadism and serum levels of T supporting such a diagnosis received exogenous T for >/= 3 months and were assessed for any clinical and biochemical response. Of an initial group of 45 men (mean age 59.2 years) 38 completed the study. RESULTS: Most men presented with symptoms of sexual dysfunction, lack of energy and/or depression. There were differences before and after treatment only in bioavailable T (BT), with none in the levels of total T (TT). There was a strong correlation before and after treatment in the levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, and a weak negative correlation between gonadotrophins and BT. Neither TT nor BT had predictive value for the treatment response. There was a trend to a correlation between BT levels and treatment success. Changes in serum prostate specific antigen were insignificant during the limited period. CONCLUSION: The lack of accurate methods for diagnosing SLOH suggests that a therapeutic trial of T supplementation is warranted in men in whom there are no contraindications. The 3-month period largely circumvents the placebo effect and has minimal risks for serious adverse effects (mostly in relation to prostate safety). This controversial position needs further evaluation with a larger cohort and other biochemical measurements.

T1  - Behavioural and psychological syndromes in Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 0885-6230
Y1  - 2004/11/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The origins of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia are still poorly understood. By focusing on piecemeal behaviours as opposed to more robust syndrome change valid biological correlates may be overlooked. Our understanding of BPSD via the identification of neuropsychiatric syndromes. METHODS: We recruited 435 subjects from old age psychiatry and elderly care memory outpatient clinics fulfilling the criteria for diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease. Behavioural and psychological symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Principal components factor analysis was carried out on the composite scores of the 12 symptom domains to identify behavioural syndromes (factors). Results were confirmed by performing three different rotations: Varimax, Equamax and Quartimax. RESULTS: Four factors were identified (which accounted for 57% of the variance): 'affect' factor-depression/dysphoria, anxiety, irritability/lability and agitation/aggression; 'physical behaviour' factor-apathy, aberrant motor behaviour, sleep disturbance and appetite/eating disturbance; 'psychosis' factor-delusions and hallucinations; 'hypomania' factor-disinhibition and elation/euphoria. These groups were unchanged when different methods of rotation were used. CONCLUSIONS: We report novel observations that agitation/aggression/irritability cluster within a depressive symptom factor and apathy is found within a physical behaviour factor.

T1  - Routine screening for depression in radiation oncology patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 1537-453X
Y1  - 2004/10/
AB  - PURPOSE: Depression is a debilitating illness with symptoms that overlap those of cancer and radiotherapy. We sought to measure the frequency of depression in adult radiation oncology patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) was incorporated into routine clinical evaluation of patients. Results were analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four patients were screened and 19 (15%) endorsed significant depressive symptoms. Of these, levels of depression were: 58% mild, 32% moderate, and 10% severe. Twenty-six percent of the depressed group had a history of previous psychiatric diagnoses and 32% previously had been placed on psychotropic medications. The most frequent somatic symptoms for the entire group were loss of energy (73%) and tiredness or fatigue (69%). All depressed patients endorsed some somatic symptoms, but these alone were insufficient to score in the range of depression. CONCLUSIONS: A simple tool can be administered in the clinic by radiation oncologists to screen for depression. The frequency of depression in our patients was 15%. Somatic symptoms alone were insufficient to score as depressed.

T1  - Potential treatment effects of donepezil not detected in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials: a physician survey
LA  - eng
SN  - 0885-6230
Y1  - 2004/10/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clinical trials of the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil have used standard psychometric tools to evaluate treatment efficacy. These trials, however, appear not to capture clinically demonstrable, but otherwise unmeasured, beneficial treatment effects. We sought to identify and categorize clinically recognizable effects of donepezil treatment in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: A list of potential effects was developed using clinical trials data and the experience of an expert panel. These were incorporated in a questionnaire, which was tested with a focus group, revised and then used in a postal survey of physicians. Data were classified by cognitive domain, and reviewed by a second panel. RESULTS: Items that were most often rated as being improved were related to frontal systems function, including attentional capacity and initiative. Behavioral symptoms that were among the highest rated items were apathy, mood, and agitation. The top two other items were social interactions and involvement in domestic activities. Of the top ten symptomatic treatment effects, only four appeared to be readily identified by current standard measures. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians recognize as important several treatment effects that are not well captured by current standard measures. New methods are needed to capture such effects, which also have the potential to offer insight into the neurobiology of the human cholinergic system.

METHODS: Using a correlational, descriptive design, 206 southern rural African American women were invited to participate in a face-to-face interview that occurred in a variety of community-based settings. RESULTS: The factor analysis of the Beck Depression Inventory-II resulted in a two-factor solution. Symptoms such as pessimism and worthlessness loaded high on the first factor (cognitive). The second factor explained somatic-affective symptoms of depression, with factor loadings high on tiredness and fatigue and loss of energy. CONCLUSIONS: The application of the Beck Depression Inventory-II among African American people would generate needed information about how depressive symptoms may be expressed among them. Knowledge gained from this study promises to be useful for developing appropriate research studies and population-specific treatment approaches for this group of women.

T1  - Factor structure and differential validity of the expanded Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 1073-1911
Y1  - 2004/06/
AB  - The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is one of the most widely used measures in psychiatric outcome and clinical psychopharmacology research. To date, however; research on the psychometric properties of the expanded version of the BPRS (BPRS-E) has been limited. An exploratory factor analysis (n = 360) using maximum likelihood extraction with oblimin rotation found a four-factor solution (Thought Disturbance, Animation, Mood Disturbance, Apathy) to underlie the BPRS-E. Furthermore, these factors were logical in nature and estimates of internal consistency were acceptable. A confirmatory factor analysis conducted on a second, independent sample (n = 280)found that for the five models currently available in the literature, the model developed herein provided the best fit to the data. Again, estimates of internal consistency were found acceptable. Finally, the four factors demonstrated appropriate differential validity with regards to both demographic variables and various psychiatric diagnoses.

T1  - Case-finding for depressive and exhausted mood in the general population: reliability and validity of a symptom-driven diagnostic scale. Results from the prospective MONICA/KORA Augsburg Study
LA  - eng
SN  - 1047-2797
Y1  - 2004/05/
AB  - PURPOSE: Depressed and exhausted mood warrants epidemiological scrutiny as a cardiovascular risk factor. We evaluated the reliability and validity of a symptom-driven diagnostic scale. METHODS: To assess a depressed mood, items were derived from an extended battery of psychosocial questionnaires in a population-based study including 11,949 subjects aged 25 to 74 years. RESULTS: Eight items from the 24-item von Zerssen checklist were extracted by factor analysis resulting in an approximately normally distributed scale (range 0-24; mean=8.23, SD 4.76). Median for men was 8.00 and 10.00 for women. Its internal consistency was high (Cronbach's alpha 0.88). Test-retest reliability of a sub-sample was 0.83. Determining concurrent validity, correlation coefficients against a single depression questionnaire in 8237 subjects (p < 0.001) and SF-36 subscales (vitality and mental health) (both p < 0.0001) in 4226 subjects proved to be significant. Construct validity was confirmed by significant associations (all p < 0.001) with sleeping complaints, social isolation, and unhappiness. Test values for men above the 80th percentile exhibited significant hazard ratios for subsequent total mortality (80th percentile: HR 2.17, 95% CI: 1.31-13.55). CONCLUSION: The scale comprises eight items describing motivational depletion, decreased vitality, irritability, and an anxious mood with sufficient internal and external reliability, concurrent and construct validity. Its normal distribution allows a graduated analysis of different thresholds. The instrument may be particularly useful to identify exhausted and depressed mood of otherwise apparently healthy subjects in the general population.

T1  - Paroxetine does not improve symptoms and impairs cognition in frontotemporal dementia: a double-blind randomized controlled trial
LA  - eng
SN  - 0033-3158
Y1  - 2004/04/
ET  - 2003/12/10
AB  - RATIONALE: Patients with frontal variant frontotemporal dementia (fvFTD) present with disinhibition, impulsiveness, apathy, altered appetite and stereotypic behaviors. A non-randomized clinical trial found improvement in these symptoms after treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). OBJECTIVES: We aimed to subject a SSRI, paroxetine, to a more rigorous test of its efficacy using a double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental design. METHODS: Ten subjects meeting the consensus criteria for FTD were entered into a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Doses of paroxetine were progressively increased to 40 mg daily. The same regimen was used for placebo capsules. Subjects were assessed with a battery of cognitive tests in the sixth week of paroxetine and placebo treatment. At each assessment, caregivers were interviewed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and asked to complete the Cambridge Behavioral Inventory. RESULTS: There were no significant differences on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory or the Cambridge Behavioral Inventory. Paroxetine caused a decrease in accuracy on the paired associates learning task, reversal learning and a delayed pattern recognition task. There were no changes on the decision-making task, in spatial span, spatial recognition, spatial working memory, digit span and verbal fluency. CONCLUSIONS: This study finds no evidence for the efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of fvFTD. The results suggest that a chronic course of paroxetine may selectively impair paired associates learning, reversal learning and delayed pattern recognition. This pattern of deficits closely resembles that seen after tryptophan depletion. Results are discussed with respect to current theories on serotonergic modulation of orbitofrontal/ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

T1  - Validity and reliability of the newly translated Hellenic Neuropsychiatric Inventory (H-NPI) applied to Greek outpatients with Alzheimer's disease: a study of disturbing behaviors among referrals to a memory clinic
LA  - eng
SN  - 0885-6230
Y1  - 2004/03/
AB  - CONTEXT: No rating scales of the neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients with dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have previously been developed or translated. OBJECTIVES: To develop a Hellenic translation of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), to evaluate it's reliability and validity, and to compare NPI results in Greek patients referred to a neuropsychiatry clinic for either of two reasons: disturbing behaviors evoking embarrassment and disturbing behaviors evoking fear in the caregiver. METHODS: The Hellenic translations of the NPI, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and Emotional Distress Scale (EDS) were compared in evaluating 29 consecutive referrals of patients with AD. RESULTS: The Hellenic NPI (H-NPI) demonstrated a high degree of internal consistency reliability, and of concurrent validity when compared to the BPRS or the EDS. Patients referred for behaviors evoking embarrassment presented with higher scores on NPI ratings of apathy. However, patients referred for behaviors evoking fear presented with higher scores on NPI ratings of aggression and irritability. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the H-NPI is a reliable instrument, able to detect differences in clinically referred groups of AD patients.

T1  - Do maternal psychotic symptoms predict offspring's psychotic disorder? Findings from the Helsinki High-Risk Study
LA  - eng
SN  - 0165-1781
Y1  - 2004/02/15
AB  - The Helsinki High-Risk (HR) Study is a follow-up study of 179 offspring born to mothers with DSM-IV-TR diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, other schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and affective psychoses. Mothers comprised all female patients born between 1916 and 1948 who had been treated with hospital diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or schizoaffective psychoses in any mental hospital in the city of Helsinki up to 1974, and who had given birth in Helsinki between 1960 and 1964. In this report we conducted a principal factor analysis of maternal symptoms using 12 items of the Major Symptoms of Schizophrenia Scale (MSSS), the global ratings of anhedonia-asociality and avolition-apathy from the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), and the global rating of bizarre behavior from the Scale for the Assessment of Positive symptoms (SAPS), and examined whether the factor scores predicted the offspring's morbidity from psychotic disorders. We found a four-factor solution (negative, positive, catatonic, and affective symptom factors). High maternal positive symptom factor score significantly predicted decreased morbidity from schizophrenia among offspring (P=0.0098). Our result suggests that maternal positive symptoms are less harmful to the child than other maternal psychotic symptoms, and supports the view that positive symptoms are non-specific symptoms of psychosis rather than core features of schizophrenia.

T1  - Perception of males' aging symptoms, health and well-being in elderly community-dwelling men is not related to circulating androgen levels
LA  - eng
SN  - 0306-4530
Y1  - 2004/02/
AB  - Aging in men is associated with a progressive but variable decline in androgen production. In aging men there is also an increased occurrence of symptoms such as lack of concentration, nervousness, impaired memory, depressive mood, insomnia, lack of energy and general sense of well-being, decreased libido and erectile dysfunction, periodic sweating, bone and joint complaints, reduction of strength and increased adiposity. This ill-defined male climacterium syndrome is often referred to as "andropause", with the underlying implication that it is at least in part related to (relative) androgen deficiency. Recently an "aging males" symptoms' (AMS) rating scale was developed aimed at a more systematic description of severity of symptoms related to a clinically defined "male climacteric". We studied the relationship of male climacteric symptoms as assessed by the AMS with androgen levels and other questionnaires assessing the perception of health and well-being. Serum levels of sex steroids, sex hormone binding globulin and gonadotropins were measured in blood samples of 161 healthy, ambulatory, elderly men, aged 74-89 years who also completed the AMS scale. Mean value of total, free and bioavailable testosterone in this group was 401.6, 6.8 and 151.4 ng/dl, respectively, with 24.7, 32.4 and 52.2% of the values under the normal range for young men. The results of the AMS scores mostly suggested mild psychological and mild to moderate somatovegetative symptoms. However, clear sexual symptoms were reported in 88% of cases. None of the three AMS domain scale scores significantly correlated with testosterone, free testosterone or bioavailable testosterone. Significant correlations were observed between results for the AMS scores and those for other health questionnaires, but none of the subscores for the latter questionnaires correlated with androgen serum levels. In conclusion, the results of this study have shown that, as assessed by the AMS, healthy ambulatory elderly males over 70 had a high perception of sexual symptoms with mild psychological and mild to moderate somatovegetative symptoms. These data failed to support the view that in healthy elderly men, "climacteric symptoms" can predict androgen levels.

T1  - Changing investment in activities and interests in elders' lives: theory and measurement
LA  - eng
SN  - 0091-4150
Y1  - 2004
AB  - Socioemotional selectivity and gerotranscendence, newer theories with roots in the disengagement theory of aging, provided the theoretical framework for a new measure of perceived change in investment in a variety of pursuits. The 30-item Change in Activity and Interest Index (CAII) was given to a sample of 327 outpatients aged 65-94. Items with at least 30% decreased investment responses included Entertaining in my home, Concern with others' opinions, Shopping and buying things, and Attending social events with new people. Principal Components Analysis of the index with dichotomous recoding (less vs. more or same investment) resulted in four factors: Active Instrumental (AI), Social Intellectual (SI), Spiritual Concerns (SC), and Transcendence (TR). Support for socioemotional selectivity and gerotranscendence is evident in the reported increase of importance of SI pursuits, with concurrent decrease in importance of AI activities among these respondents. Zero-order correlations of component scores with study variables suggest that AI and SI are more clearly related to older age, functional impairment, and negative affect than are SC and TR. The CAII appears to tap several dimensions of change in interests; the index gives geriatric mental health practitioners and researchers a tool to measure an aspect of social development that has been neglected in gerontology.

T1  - The use of the Minimum Data Set to identify depression in the elderly
LA  - eng
SN  - 1525-8610
Y1  - 2003///Nov-Dec
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether depression in the elderly in institutionalized settings could be identified using the mood indicators in the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0 (Section E1, Items A-P). DESIGN: Descriptive study. SETTING: Three nursing homes in the southeastern part of the country. PARTICIPANTS: Residents aged 65 and above. MEASUREMENTS: The items in "Indicators of Depression, Anxiety and Sad Mood" on the MDS 2.0 were used to identify observable features of depression in the elderly. The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) was used to validate the MDS indicators. Consensus analysis, which controls raters' bias, raters' ability, and item difficulty, was used to analyze data. RESULTS: No depressive patterns were detected using the MDS indicators. On the CSDD, distinct depressive features were identified: anxiety, sadness, lack of reaction to pleasant events, irritability, agitation, multiple physical complaints, loss of interest, appetite loss, and lack of energy. CONCLUSION: The incongruent findings on the MDS indicators the CSDD may be reflective of the assessment process used with the MDS rather than its ability to identify features of elderly depression. The practice of allowing nondirect caregivers to complete the MDS may have serious implications for the accuracy of the data collected.

LA  - dut
SN  - 0167-9228
Y1  - 2003/08/
AB  - Apathy is defined as a disorder of motivation that expresses itself at an emotional, cognitive and behavioural level. Apathy can occur as a symptom and a syndrome. In the recent years diagnostic criteria and a number of scales for measuring apathy in elderly with psychiatric or neurological disorders have been introduced. Two scales are specifically developed to measure apathy, the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) from Marin and the Apathy Scale (AS) from Starkstein. Both scales have been translated into Dutch. The AS is more convenient. The AS in addition can be used when applying the criteria for the apathy syndrome which has been introduced in 2001 by Starkstein. In addition, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the 'Gedragsobservatieschaal voor de Intramurale Psychogeniatrie' (GIP) (a scale in Dutch) have an apathy domain. Conceptual problems surrounding apathy have only partly been resolved. The criteria for the apathy syndrome can only be used for assessing the extent of the problem. Apathy and depression are strongly correlated. Studies show that apathy as a syndrome can occur without concomitant depression in the elderly, but regularly occurs besides a depressive disorder, in percentages varying between 9% and 53% of the population under study. Especially the varying validity of an apathy syndrome in relation to late life depression needs further clarification.

T1  - A comparison of three fatigue measures in veterans with cancer
LA  - eng
SN  - 0735-7907
Y1  - 2003/06/
AB  - Fatigue is a highly prevalent and distressing symptom in cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of three fatigue measures [the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Fatigue Subscale (FACT-F), and the lack of energy item from the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale Short Form (MSAS-SF)] and compare these measures in relation to broader quality-of-life (QOL) constructs and clinical factors in veteran cancer patients. One-hundred-eighty cancer patients completed the BFI, FACT-F, FACT-G, MSAS-SF, and the Zung depression scale with concurrent Karnofsky performance status (KPS), laboratory tests, and demographic data. The Cronbach alpha coefficient was from 0.93 to 0.94 for BFI fatigue scales and 0.94 for FACT-F. There were significant correlations between BFI subscales, FACT-F, and lack of energy from MSAS-SF (p < 0.0001). All three fatigue measures showed significant correlation with MSAS-SF symptom subscales (p < 0.0001), FACT-G subscales (p < 0.0001), depression (p < 0.0001), KPS (p < 0.0001), inpatient status (P < 0.0001), insomnia (p < 0.05), hemoglobin (p < 0.05), and albumin levels (p < 0.01). Distress from lack of energy discriminated among levels from the BFI, FACT-F, and FACT-G subscales and MSAS-SF subsclea by one-way of variance analysis. Patient responses to BFI, FACT-F, and the lack of energy item yielded similar information about broader QOL constructs and clinical factors. Single questions about lack of energy, or fatigue severity, may provide a simple and acceptable way to assess fatigue.

T1  - Apathy and executive function in depressed elderly
LA  - eng
SN  - 0891-9887
Y1  - 2003/06/
AB  - Apathy and executive cognitive dysfunction (ECD) are important though conceptually different aspects of late-life depression. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship of apathy to ECD. The authors also evaluated the relationship of apathy and ECD to global cognitive impairment and word generation. Fifty-two elderly subjects with major depression and MMSE scores of 15 or greater were evaluated with apathy-related items from the Hamilton rating scale for depression (ApHRSD), the Executive Interview (EXIT), the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), and the Controlled Oral Word Association test (COWA). ApHRSD scores were not significantly correlated with any of these variables. EXIT scores were correlated significantly with DRS and COWA. The results suggest that apathy and ECD may be independent of each other in some samples of elderly with late-life depression. Correlations may have been reduced by low variance for the variables of interest and by psychometric limitations of the ApHRSD.

T1  - Fatigue in the general population
LA  - eng
SN  - 0378-584X
Y1  - 2003/04/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue symptoms are often found in cancer patients. One test to assess fatigue is the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20). It has been successfully applied to specific groups of cancer patients. However, until now population-based norm values are missing. METHODS: We conducted an investigation on a representative sample of the adult German population, which comprised 2,037 subjects aged 14-92 years. RESULTS: The reliability of the 5 MFI-20 subscales (general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced activity, reduced motivation, and mental fatigue) is satisfying. The correlations between MFI-20 subscales and the fatigue scale of the quality-of-life questionnaire EORTC indicate convergent validity. As an important result we found that all subscales of the MFI-20 showed a clear and nearly linear dependency on age with higher fatigue values for older subjects (p < 0.0001). Females as compared with males are characterized by higher mean values in all MFI-20 subscales (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results show that it is necessary to take into account age and sex when different groups of cancer patients have to be compared.

T1  - Validation evidence for the French Canadian adaptation of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory as a measure of cancer-related fatigue
LA  - eng
SN  - 0162-220X
Y1  - 2003/04/
AB  - Cancer-related fatigue is the most reported symptom among patients with cancer. Researchers in the field of psychooncology have encouraged the development of short instruments, which allow for easier completion by clinical populations while still maintaining solid psychometric properties. The current study examined the validity and reliability of the French Canadian adaptation of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) among women (n = 277) and men (n = 327) undergoing therapy for breast or prostate cancer, respectively. An exploratory factor analysis of the selected 15-item MFI yielded the following four factors: general/physical, mental, reduced motivation, and reduced activity. This was supported by a confirmatory factor analysis. The reliability, as evaluated by test-retest and Cronbach alpha internal consistency reliability coefficients of the French Canadian shortened MFI, was acceptable. In addition, the four factor-based scores correlated in a theoretically meaningful manner with existing measures of mood disturbance (Profile of Mood States and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), cancer-related stressors (Inventory of Recent Life Experiences), coping with illness (Coping with Health Injuries and Problems Scale), quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire), and insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), suggesting good construct, convergent, and concurrent criterion validity. Although further validation is recommended, the results for the French Canadian MFI in assessing cancer-related fatigue in both women and men undergoing cancer treatments showed good psychometric qualities.

T1  - Social networks, social integration, and social engagement determine cognitive decline in community-dwelling Spanish older adults
LA  - eng
SN  - 1079-5014
SN  - 1758-5368
Y1  - 2003/03/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the influence of social networks and social engagement on cognitive decline in a population-based cohort of elderly people, and to assess gender differences in the effect of social relations on cognition. METHODS: A longitudinal study of community-dwelling people over 65 was carried out. Cognitive function (orientation and memory) in 1997 and cognitive decline (absent, mild, and severe) over 4 years (1993-1997) were assessed using an instrument previously validated for populations with a low level of education. The effect of social networks, social integration, and social engagement with friends, children, and relatives on cognitive function and cognitive decline was estimated by multiple linear and logistic regressions after adjusting for age, sex, education, depressive symptoms, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and functional status. RESULTS: Poor social connections, infrequent participation in social activities, and social disengagement predict the risk of cognitive decline in elderly individuals. The probability of cognitive decline was lower for both men and women with a high frequency of visual contact with relatives and community social integration. Engagement with friends seemed to be protective for cognitive decline in women but not in men. DISCUSSION: This longitudinal study indicates that few social ties, poor integration, and social disengagement are risk factors for cognitive decline among community-dwelling elderly persons. The nature of the ties that influence cognition may vary in men and women.

T1  - Executive dysfunction and apathy predict functional impairment in Alzheimer disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1064-7481
Y1  - 2003///Mar-Apr
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which executive cognitive dysfunction and frontally-mediated behavioral disturbances are associated with functional impairment in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: Patients with AD (N=45) completed the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, and patients' caregivers completed the Frontal Systems Behavioral Inventory and a modified form of the Lawton and Brody Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) Questionnaire. RESULTS: Multiple-regression analyses revealed that executive cognitive dysfunction and apathy scores accounted for 44% of the variance in instrumental activities of daily living; executive cognitive dysfunction alone explained 17% of the variance in instrumental ADLs, and apathy scores explained an additional 27%. Executive dysfunction and frontal-behavioral impairment explained 28% of the variance in basic ADLs (BADLs), and, after accounting for executive dysfunction, apathy was the only symptom found to explain additional unique variance in BADLs. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that specific cognitive and behavioral symptoms are associated with functional impairment in patients with AD.

T1  - Lifetime depressive and somatic symptoms as preclinical markers of late-onset depression
LA  - eng
SN  - 0940-1334
Y1  - 2003/02/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several risk factors of depression, i. e., female gender and life-stress, have been identified. Few studies have focussed on symptoms as preclinical markers of depression. In these studies current symptoms like dysphoria, tiredness and increased appetite predicted later depression. Even though of possible interest for treatment, no study focussed on lifetime symptoms as preclinical markers of depression. Consequently, we examined lifetime depressive and somatic symptoms with respect to later development of late-onset depression. METHODS: 664 non-depressed elderly subjects without lifetime diagnoses of depression at the initial examination were selected for a prospective follow-up study (mean follow-up +/- SD: 5.02 +/- 2.44 years). 51 subjects (mean age +/- SD: 66.6 +/- 11.3) developing late-onset depression (defined as depression starting after age 60) were compared to those remaining non-depressed (mean age +/- SD: 59.1 +/- 16.0) during follow-up using the CIDI. To determine the influence of lifetime symptoms on the development of depression, chi-square statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: The following symptoms being present over a period longer than two weeks were individual preclinical markers of late-onset depression: dysphoria, increased appetite, insomnia, lack of energy, morning depth, lack of joy and interest, inferiority feeling, lack of self-confidence, poor concentration, indecisiveness, thinking about death, wish to die and joint pain. The most important symptoms elevating the risk of late-onset depression in a multivariate model were lack of joy and interest, poor concentration, increased appetite, lack of energy and joint pain. CONCLUSIONS: Different symptoms can be used individually and in combination to predict later depression. This might allow early treatment.

T1  - The apathy inventory: assessment of apathy and awareness in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and mild cognitive impairment
LA  - eng
SN  - 0885-6230
Y1  - 2002/12/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to establish the validity and reliability of the apathy inventory (IA), a rating scale for global assessment of apathy and separate assessment of emotional blunting, lack of initiative, and lack of interest. METHOD: Information for the IA can be obtained from the patient or from a caregiver. We evaluated 115 subjects using the IA, consisting of 19 healthy elderly subjects, 24 patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), 12 subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 60 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). RESULTS: Internal consistency, item reliability, and between-rater reliability were high. A test-retest reliability study demonstrated that caregiver responses to IA questions were stable over short intervals. A concurrent validity study showed that the IA assesses apathy as effectively as the Neuro Psychiatric Inventory apathy domain. In the caregiver-based evaluation, AD subjects had significantly higher scores than controls, both for global apathy score and for the lack of interest dimension. When the AD patients were subdivided according to diagnostic criteria for apathy, apathetic patients had significantly higher scores than non apathetic patients. With the patient-based evaluations, no differences were found among the AD, MCI and control groups. The scores in the patient-based evaluations were only higher for the PD group versus the control subjects. The results also indicated that AD patients had poor awareness of their emotional blunting and lack of initiative. CONCLUSIONS: The IA is a reliable method for assessing in demented and non-demented elderly subjects several dimensions of the apathetic syndrome, and also the subject's awareness of these symptoms.

T1  - Depression induced by treatment with interferon-alpha in patients affected by hepatitis C virus
LA  - eng
SN  - 0165-0327
Y1  - 2002/12/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies found a high incidence rate of neuro-psychiatric complications during long-term therapy with interferon alpha (IFNalpha), e.g. slowness, severe fatigue, hypersomnia, lethargy, depressed mood, mnemonic troubles, irritability, short temper, emotional lability, social withdrawal, and lack of concentration. The aim of this study was to examine the incidence of depressed mood and major depression in patients who were treated with IFNalpha. METHODS: 30 patients, affected by chronic active C-hepatitis, have been evaluated at baseline and 3 months after IFNalpha treatment. The evaluation consisted of psychometric assessments employing the DSM-IV criteria and the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: At end-point, 40.7% of the patients suffered from a full blown major depression, according to the DSM-IV criteria for major depression. IFNalpha treatment induced a significant increase in the MADRS score from baseline to 3 months later. The MADRS items which were significantly increased at end-point were: expressed and unexpressed sadness; irritability; insomnia; loss of appetite; and asthenia. DISCUSSION: The results show that prolonged IFNalpha treatment may induce depressive symptoms and major depression in a considerable number of subjects.

Y1  - 2002/12/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess apathy in patients with Parkinson's disease and its relation to disability, mood, personality, and cognition. METHODS: Levels of apathy in 45 patients with Parkinson's disease were compared with a group of 17 similarly disabled patients with osteoarthritis. Additional neuropsychiatric data were collected concerning levels of depression, anxiety, and hedonic tone. Personality was assessed with the tridimensional personality questionnaire. Cognitive testing included the mini-mental state examination, the Cambridge examination of cognition in the elderly, and specific tests of executive functioning. RESULTS: Patients with Parkinson's disease had significantly higher levels of apathy than equally disabled osteoarthritic patients. Furthermore, within the Parkinson sample, levels of apathy appear to be unrelated to disease progression. The patients with Parkinson's disease with the highest levels of apathy where not more likely to be depressed or anxious than those with the lowest levels of apathy, though they did show reduced hedonic tone. No differences in personality traits were detected in comparisons between patients with Parkinson's disease and osteoarthritis, or between patients in the Parkinson group with high or low levels of apathy. As a group, the patients with Parkinson's disease tended not to differ significantly from the osteoarthritic group in terms of cognitive skills. However, within the Parkinson's disease sample, the high apathy patients performed significantly below the level of the low apathy patients. This was particularly evident on tests of executive functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Apathy in Parkinson's disease is more likely to be a direct consequence of disease related physiological changes than a psychological reaction or adaptation to disability. Apathy in Parkinson's disease can be distinguished from other psychiatric symptoms and personality features that are associated with the disease, and it is closely associated with cognitive impairment. These findings point to a possible role of cognitive mechanisms in the expression of apathy.

T1  - Nationwide longitudinal study of psychological responses to September 11
LA  - eng
SN  - 0098-7484
Y1  - 2002/09/11
AB  - CONTEXT: The September 11, 2001, attacks against the United States provide a unique opportunity to examine longitudinally the process of adjustment to a traumatic event on a national scale. OBJECTIVE: To examine the degree to which demographic factors, mental and physical health history, lifetime exposure to stressful events, September 11-related experiences, and coping strategies used shortly after the attacks predict psychological outcomes over time. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A national probability sample of 3496 adults received a Web-based survey; 2729 individuals (78% participation rate) completed it between 9 and 23 days (75% within 9 to 14 days) after the terrorist attacks. A random sample of 1069 panelists residing outside New York, NY, were drawn from the wave 1 sample (n = 2729) and received a second survey; 933 (87% participation rate) completed it approximately 2 months following the attacks. A third survey (n = 787) was completed approximately 6 months after the attacks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: September 11-related symptoms of acute stress, posttraumatic stress, and global distress. RESULTS: Seventeen percent of the US population outside of New York City reported symptoms of September 11-related posttraumatic stress 2 months after the attacks; 5.8% did so at 6 months. High levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms were associated with female sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-2.31), marital separation (OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.06-6.14), pre-September 11 physician-diagnosed depression or anxiety disorder (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.33-2.56) or physical illness (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.99), severity of exposure to the attacks (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11-1.55), and early disengagement from coping efforts (eg, giving up: OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.27-2.20; denial: OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.07-1.64; and self-distraction: OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07-1.59). In addition to demographic and pre-September 11 health variables, global distress was associated with severity of loss due to the attacks (beta =.07; P =.008) and early coping strategies (eg, increased with denial: beta =.08; P =.005; and giving up: beta =.05; P =.04; and decreased with active coping: beta = -.08; P =.002). CONCLUSIONS: The psychological effects of a major national trauma are not limited to those who experience it directly, and the degree of response is not predicted simply by objective measures of exposure to or loss from the trauma. Instead, use of specific coping strategies shortly after an event is associated with symptoms over time. In particular, disengaging from coping efforts can signal the likelihood of psychological difficulties up to 6 months after a trauma.

T1  - An informant-based assessment of apathy in Alzheimer disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 0894-878X
Y1  - 2002/09/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To standardize a new rating scale for the assessment of apathy in Alzheimer disease (AD) and report on its reliability, structure, and relation to other clinical features of AD. BACKGROUND: apathy is a common prominent behavioral syndrome accompanying AD and is associated with excess disability and increased caregiver burden. Current instruments for the assessment of apathy in AD do not explicitly and systematically attempt to differentiate limited activity and engagement due to lack of interest from inability or longstanding, premorbid personality traits. The present assessment, the Dementia Apathy Interview and Rating (DAIR), was developed taking these discriminations into account in question construction and interview format. METHODS: One hundred participants (50% women) in the University Memory and Aging Center Research Registry with Probable or Possible AD (by NINCDS-ADRDA criteria) were assessed through caregiver interview or direct patient assessment for apathy, depression, and severity of cognitive and functional deficits. Item distribution characteristics, factor analysis, and evaluation of reliability were used to develop the final item set for the DAIR, and correlations with other measures were examined. RESULTS: A 16-item unidimensional apathy scale with excellent internal consistency (alpha = 0.89) and temporal reliability ( = 0.85 over 2 months) was developed. Individual differences in apathy on the DAIR were unrelated to dysphoria. Apathy was significantly associated with functional and cognitive impairment, while depression was not. CONCLUSIONS: The DAIR is a reliable informant-based assessment of apathy in persons with AD. Although apathy is assessed with respect to behaviors within the repertoire of patients, this behavioral syndrome remains associated with more severe deficits in cognitive and adaptive functioning. Associations between depression and dementia severity reported in some studies may reflect the confounding of apathy and depression in some assessment instruments.

T1  - The Key Behaviors Change Inventory and executive functioning in an elderly clinic sample
LA  - eng
SN  - 1385-4046
Y1  - 2002/08/
AB  - The Key Behaviors Change Inventory (KBCI) was developed to assess executive, behavioral, and emotional functioning following brain insults and to track the course of recovery. The purpose of this study was to investigate, in an elderly memory disorder clinic sample, the convergent and discriminant validity of the KBCI by examining the relationships between various measures of executive functioning and the KBCI scales that theoretically relate to executive functions. The KBCI was administered to the caregivers of 97 consecutive patients who came to a memory disorders clinic seeking services. The KBCI scales of Inattention, Apathy, Unawareness of Problems, and Communication Problems were significantly correlated with cognitive measures of executive functioning but not with measures of memory, visuospatial abilities or global cognitive functioning. In contrast, KBCI scales of Interpersonal Difficulties, Somatic Difficulties, and Emotional Adjustment were not related to any cognitive measures, either executive or nonexecutive. Contrary to predicted findings, the Impulsivity Scale was not associated with cognitive measures of executive functioning. This lack of relationship most likely reflects the failure to include executive measures of orbitofrontal functioning in this study. Results provide convergent and discriminant validity support for the KBCI. The KBCI may be a useful tool for assessing and tracking the executive, behavioral, and emotional sequelae of neurologic disorders.

AB  - The GIP-28 is the shortened version of the 82-item Behavior Rating Scale for Psychogeriatric Inpatients. Originally it was meant and psychometrically evaluated for use in psychogeriatric and elderly psychiatric inpatients. We supposed that the GIP-28 might be useful to detect psychosocial and cognitive problems in residents of homes for the elderly. It was therefore tested in 15 residential homes (n = 949). The instrument consists of three, factor-analytically derived, scales: 'Apathy', 'Cognition' and 'Affect'. These three principal components were also identified in the data of the inhabitants of the residential homes. Internal consistency of the scales, as measured with Cronbach's Alpha is .75, .66, .80 respectively. Construct validity of the GIP-28 is satisfactory: the correlation between the Affect scale and the GDS was .36 and between the Cognition scale and the MMSE was -.36. The GIP-28 was associated with another observation scale for care needs (r = .54). The GIP-28 can be used to detect mental health problems in the population of residential homes. However, it is neither meant nor suited to replace psychiatric diagnostic procedures.

T1  - Cutoff score on the apathy evaluation scale in subjects with traumatic brain injury
LA  - eng
SN  - 0269-9052
Y1  - 2002/06/
AB  - This cross-sectional study was designed to determine a cutoff score on the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) that predicts a clinician's designation of a subject with TBI as apathetic or not. Forty-five outpatients with TBI completed the AES-S, and 37 family members, friends, or significant others filled out the AES-I. Three clinicians prospectively gave their impressions of the presence or absence of apathy and retrospectively chose the degree of apathy on a 7-point subjective rating scale. The data was analysed by logistic regression and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated. No cutoff score on the AES-S or AES-I was found to have reasonable sensitivity and specificity with respect to the ability to predict the clinician's designation of a subject as apathetic. The AES requires further study if it is to be used to measure apathy following TBI.

T1  - Measuring change in psychiatric symptoms using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory: Nursing Home version
LA  - eng
SN  - 0885-6230
Y1  - 2002/05/
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) is a modified version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Accurate interpretation of change in the symptom ratings on the NPI-NH, as with any measure, is a concern for both clinicians and researchers. The purpose of this article is to present data for the interpretation of reliable change in the NPI-NH scores for acute geriatric neuropsychiatry patients. METHOD: Fifty-two geriatric psychiatry inpatients were administered the NPI-NH twice, at a 72-hour interval. Standard errors of difference scores were used to calculate confidence intervals for each of the NPI-NH subscales and the total score. RESULTS: Based on the calculations described above, estimates of reliable change on the individual subscales ranged from plus or minus 1.29 points on the Euphoria/Elation subscale to 5.13 points on the Anxiety subscale. Statistically meaningful change on the Agitation and the Apathy subscales was established at 4.0 and 4.3 points, respectively. A change in the total score of plus or minus 22 points is required to exceed the possible range of measurement error, at a 0.80 confidence interval (CI). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results of this study indicate that the clinician evaluating elderly psychiatric inpatients should interpret a change in the total score of less than 22 points with caution, because it may be due to measurement error.

T1  - Apathy and executive function in Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1355-6177
Y1  - 2002/03/
AB  - Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have linked the presence of apathy to alterations in frontal lobe functions, but few studies have explored the relationship using standard neuropsychological measures in patients with AD. We administered a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests and a behavior rating scale to 80 patients with AD. We explored the relationship of apathy to executive dysfunction. AD patients with apathy performed significantly worse on tests of executive function (WAIS-R Digit Symbol, Trail-Making, Stroop Color Interference Test) than AD patients without apathy. The presence of dysphoria did not modify these results and no significant relationships were found between tests of executive functions and dysphoria. Performance on executive measures as a group were effective in correctly classifying patients as apathetic or nonapathetic with 75% accuracy. Neuropsychological measures not dependent on executive functions were unrelated to apathy. Apathy is associated with executive dysfunction and not with other neuropsychological deficits. Apathy is distinct from dysphoria.

T1  - Association between neuropsychiatric and autonomic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 0959-9851
Y1  - 2002/02/
AB  - We sought to determine whether there was an association between specific neuropsychiatric deficits and autonomic dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We studied 20 patients and 20 age-matched control subjects with neuropsychiatric tests (Blessed, Cornell depression and NPI scores) and autonomic tests (Deep breath (HRdb), 30:15 ratio and orthostatic hypotension (Bpoh)). The 30:15 ratio was consistently reduced in AD patients as compared to control subjects (1.05+/-0.07 for patients and 1.18+/-0.1 for controls, p 0.001). Whereas there were no significant differences in the HRdb and presence of Bpoh. In AD patients with an abnormal 30:15 ratio, there were significant abnormalities in the Blessed score and in the apathy, delusions and aberrant motor behavior items of the NPI. The other autonomic tests did not correlate with any neuropsychiatric score. The relationship between abnormal cortical function and impaired 30:15 ratio suggested that a lack of cortical modulation of autonomic circuits may underlie cardiovascular instability in these patients.

T1  - Use of the Chinese version of the Beck Depression Inventory for screening depression in primary care
LA  - eng
SN  - 0022-3018
Y1  - 2002/02/
AB  - Many Asian-Americans are unfamiliar with depression and its treatment. When depressed, they generally seek treatment from their primary care physicians and complain about their physical symptoms, resulting in under-recognition and under-treatment of depression. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the Chinese version of the Beck Depression Inventory (CBDI) for screening depression among Chinese-Americans in primary care. A total of 503 Chinese-Americans in the primary care clinic of a community health center were administered the CBDI for depression screening. Patients who screened positive (CBDI > or = 16) were interviewed by a psychiatrist using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, patient version (SCID-I/P) for confirmation of the diagnosis. Patients who screened negative (CBDI < 16) were randomly selected to be interviewed using the depression module of the SCID-I/P. The results of the SCID-I/P interview were used as the standard for evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of the CBDI. A total of 815 Chinese-Americans in a primary care clinic were approached, and 503 completed the CBDI. Seventy-six (15%) screened positive (CBDI > or = 16), and the prevalence of major depression was 19.6% by using extrapolated results from SCID-I/P interviews. When administered by a native-speaking research assistant, the CBDI has good sensitivity (.79), specificity (.91), positive predictive value (.79), and negative predictive value (.91). Despite the commonly believed tendency to focus on physical symptoms rather than depressed mood, Chinese-Americans are able to report symptoms of depression in response to a questionnaire. The CBDI, when administered by research assistants, has good sensitivity and specificity in recognizing major depression in this population. Lack of interest among Chinese-American patients in using the CBDI as a self-rating instrument has limited its use for depression screening in primary care settings.

T1  - Snoezelen for dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 1469-493X
Y1  - 2002
AB  - BACKGROUND: Snoezelen, multi-sensory stimulation, provides sensory stimuli to stimulate the primary senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell, through the use of lighting effects, tactile surfaces, meditative music and the odour of relaxing essential oils (Pinkney 1997). The clinical application of snoezelen has been extended from the field of learning disability to dementia care over the past decade. The rationale for its use lies in providing a sensory environment that places fewer demands on intellectual abilities but capitalizes on the residual sensorimotor abilities of people with dementia (e.g. Buettner 1999, Hope 1998). Practitioners are keen to use snoezelen in dementia care, and some encouraging results have been documented in the area of promoting adaptive behaviours (e.g. Baker, Long 1992, Spaull 1998). However, the clinical application of snoezelen often varies in form, nature, principles and procedures. Such variations not only make examination of the therapeutic values of Snoezelen difficult, but also impede the clinical development of snoezelen in dementia care. A systematic review of evidence for the efficacy of snoezelen in the care of people with dementia is therefore needed to inform future clinical applications and research directions. OBJECTIVES: This review aims to examine the clinical efficacy of snoezelen for older people with dementia. SEARCH STRATEGY: "Snoezelen", "multi-sensory", "dement*", "Alzheimer*", "randomized control/single control/double control" were used as keywords to search seven electronic databases (e.g. MEDLINE, PsyLIT). The list of trials was compared with those identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group. SELECTION CRITERIA: All RCTs in which Snoezelen or multi-sensory programmes were used as an intervention for people with dementia were included in the review. Trial data included in the review were restricted to those involving people aged over 60 years suffering from any type of dementia, except one subject of Baker's study was aged below 60 years. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Only two RCTs fulfill the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Two reviewers independently extracted the data from these two inclusion studies. Quantitative synthesis of the comparable data from the two trials was performed. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials were included. Both Baker (and Kragt examined the short-term values of snoezelen on the behaviours of people with dementia. Although the pooled results were insignificant, the trend was in the direction of favouring treatment (hence a negative value of the SMD). The standardized mean difference (SMD) was -1.22, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) (-4.08, 1.64). Kragt's result, weighted 47%, was significant in favour of treatment, with a SMD of -2.77 and a 95% CI (-4.24, -1.29). During the snoezelen session, Kragt's subjects presented significantly fewer apathetic behaviours (t=-8.22, p<0.01), fewer restless behaviours (t=-3.00, p=0.01), fewer repetitive behaviours (t=-.822, p<0.01), and fewer disturbances (t=-4.91, p<0.01). Baker's result was slightly not in favour of the treatment, with a SMD of 0.16 and a 95% CI (-0.41, 0.73). The control subjects touched objects/equipment more appropriately within the activity sessions than the subjects who participated in snoezelen sessions (F(1,47)=5.96, p=.001). Kragt did not examine the carryover and long-term effects of snoezelen, so only Baker's results were analysed. Baker used the Behavioural and Mood Disturbance scale (BMD), the REHAB, the CAPE and MMSE to assess patients mood, behaviour and cognition after (but not immediately after) four treatment sessions and eight treatment sessions. Some assessments were carried at home, some at day hospital. There were many subscores and mostly there were no differences between treatment and control. The following significant differences were found with benefit in favour of snoezelen compared with control after four sessions: apathy ezelen compared with control after four sessions: apathy score of the BRS (CAPE) (MD -3.00, 95%CIs -5.87 to -0.13, P=0.04), after eight sessions: mood score of the BRS (CAPE) (MD -2.60, 95%CIs -4.92 to -0.28, P=0.03), total score of the BRS (CAPE) (MD -6.92, 95%CIs -13.13 to -0.7, P=0.03), speech skills of the REHAB (MD 1.46, 95%CIs 0.01 to 2.82, P=0.03), psychomotor subscore of the cognitive assessment scale of CAPE (MD -3.12, 95%CIs -5.31 to -0.93, P<0.01). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Two trials were reviewed. Although both studies examined the short-term values of snoezelen on people with dementia, it is not feasible to draw a firm conclusion at this stage, for two main reasons. Firstly, very limited data were available for analysis, thus limiting data inference and generalization. Secondly, different methodology and control conditions were adopted in the two trials. Such variations not only require a careful interpretation of results but also make the comparison of results across studies less valid. Hence, there is an urgent need for more systematic and scientific research studies to examine the clinical value of snoezelen for people with dementia. To our knowledge, there are four RCTs currently in progress. It is hoped that the data and results of these trials will enrich the systematic review of snoezelen for dementia in the next update.

T1  - Development and Preliminary Validation of an Athlete Burnout Measure
LA  - eng
SN  - 1543-2904
Y1  - 2001/12/
AB  - The purpose of this research was to develop a psychometrically sound measure of athlete burnout. In Study 1, exploratory factor analysis revealed burn-out dimensions reflective of emotional/physical exhaustion, reduced sense of swimming accomplishment, and swimming devaluation. In two subsequent studies, the psychometric properties of a refined version of this measure were examined. Independent samples of senior age-group swimmers and college athletes from a variety of sports completed a questionnaire that tapped the three burnout dimensions as well as stress- and motivation-related variables. Confirmatory factor analysis and alternative model testing supported the specified three-factor burnout model. In support of construct validity, the burnout subscales correlated positively with stress, trait anxiety, and amotivation, and correlated negatively with coping, social support, enjoyment, commitment, and intrinsic motivation indices across the two studies.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric assessment of Gilles de la Tourette patients: comparative study with other hyperkinetic and hypokinetic movement disorders
LA  - eng
SN  - 0885-3185
Y1  - 2001/11/
AB  - The role of the basal ganglia in conditions with co-occurring movement disorders and neuropsychiatric symptoms is not well known. It has been hypothesized that hyperkinesia -disinhibited behaviors and hypokinesia-inhibited behaviors result from an imbalance between the direct and indirect striatal output pathways, and that differential involvement of these pathways could account for the concurrent abnormalities in movement and behavior observed in these disorders. This study aimed to evaluate whether the pattern and the extent of the neuropsychiatric manifestations of patients with GTS, a hyperkinetic movement disorder of basal ganglia origin, differs from that of patients with other basal ganglia hyperkinetic (e.g., HD) or hypokinetic (e.g., PSP) movement disorders, and to determine whether patients with GTS show a greater frequency of hyperactive behaviors (e.g., agitation, irritability, euphoria, or anxiety) than PSP patients, and are comparable to patients with HD. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), a scale with established validity and reliability, was administered to 26 patients with GTS (mean age, 30.2 +/- 2.2 years), and the results were compared with that of 29 patients with HD (mean age, 43.8 +/- 2 years) and 34 with PSP (mean +/- S.D. age, 66.6 +/- 1.2 years). There was no difference between the groups in the total NPI scores. However, there was a double dissociation in behaviors: patients with hyperkinetic disorders (HD and GTS) exhibited significantly more agitation, irritability, anxiety, euphoria, and hyperkinesia, whereas hypokinetic patients (PSP) exhibited more apathy. Patients with GTS showed greater scores than HD patients in all those scores differentiating HD and GTS from PSP patients (e.g., agitation, irritability, anxiety and euphoria), and were differentiated in a logistic regression analysis from both HD and PSP patients in having significantly more anxiety. We found that patients with GTS manifested predominantly hyperactive behaviors similar but more pronounced than those presented by patients with HD, while those with PSP manifested hypoactive behaviors. Based on our findings and the proposed models of basal ganglia dysfunction in these disorders, we suggest that the hyperactive behaviors in GTS are comparable to those observed in HD, being both secondary to an excitatory subcortical output through the medial and orbitofrontal cortical circuits, while in PSP the hypoactive behaviors are secondary to hypostimulation of these circuits. Abnormalities of other brain structures (e.g., amygdala, brainstem nuclei) may account for the significantly higher anxiety scores differentiating GTS from HD patients.

T1  - Behavioral changes in Huntington Disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 0894-878X
Y1  - 2001///Oct-Dec
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to gain a better understanding of behavioral abnormalities in Huntington disease (HD) and to develop a method for reliably assessing these changes. BACKGROUND: Behavioral changes are a central feature of HD and often cause considerable distress and difficulty to patients and their relatives. However, they have received little attention from research despite their prevalence and clinical significance. METHODS: One hundred thirty-four patients with HD were assessed using the Problem Behaviors Assessment for Huntington Disease (PBA-HD), an instrument for rating the presence, severity and frequency of behavioral abnormalities in HD. RESULTS: The findings confirm that behavioral problems are common among patients with HD. The most common symptoms were loss of energy and initiative, poor perseverance and quality of work, impaired judgment, poor self-care and emotional blunting. Affective symptoms such as depression, anxiety and irritability occurred in around half the patients studied. Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) were rarely reported. Factor analysis distinguished three clusters of behavioral symptoms, which were interpreted respectively as reflecting Apathy, Depression and Irritability. The 'Apathy' factor was highly correlated with duration of illness, whereas no such relationship was observed for the 'Depression' and 'Irritability' factors. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that certain behavioral changes are fundamental to the progression of HD, whereas others have a more complex relationship to the disease process. The findings have implications for the choice of behavioral measures used to evaluate efficacy of therapeutic interventions.

T1  - A fall prevention program for the home environment
LA  - eng
SN  - 1084-628X
Y1  - 2001/10/
AB  - Falls are the leading cause of injury, death, and disability among people older than 65. When elders fall, they sustain such injuries as hip, spine, hand, and/or pelvic fractures. The prognosis after such a fall is poor--only half of older adults hospitalized for hip fractures are able to return home or live independently again. Even without injury, falls cause a loss of confidence that results in reduced physical activity, increased dependency, and social withdrawal. As a home care agency dealing with a geriatric population, our goal was to develop a user-friendly fall prevention program that would promote multidisciplinary assessment and intervention. We have developed a preventive approach through which clinicians and patients can collaborate on preventing falls in the home and maintaining our patients' first priority: quality of life.

T1  - Development of a scale for assessing lack of motivation in elderly persons
TT  - Construction d'une échelle d'appréciation de la démotivation chez la personne âgée
LA  - fre
SN  - 0013-7006
Y1  - 2001///Sep-Oct
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Apathy is made of depression and of loss of motivation. For patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer-type, the MMS score is inversely correlated with apathy and depression. The aim of this study is to build a scale aimed at loss of motivation and validated for elderly people. METHODS: The study was performed on 44 non-demented elderly people, 54 outpatients with dementia, mainly Alzheimer's type. After agreement of the patients and the family, patients were assessed using different scales: Cornell's for depression, Marin's for apathy, MMS for cognitive disorders. At the same time, we tested with caregivers a 21 items indirect scale listing various disorders related to loss of motivation, scored from 1 to 4: very often, often, sometimes, never. Patients were retested by 7 different caregivers, and different investigators, immediately and a month later to evaluate reproducibility, temporal stability using Cohen's Kappa and Spearman coefficients. The demotivation scale was then correlated with the other scales and Cronbach's alpha coefficient was studied. RESULTS: The 44 non-demented people were 80.25 years old +/- 7.75. 54 demented patients were included: 15 men and 39 women. The mean age was 81.47 years +/- 8.03. As Cohen's Kappa and Spearman coefficients were not sufficient for 6 items, the scale was reduced to 15 items (Presented). The depression scale is strongly and significantly correlated with the Marin's apathy scale. Internal coherence is particularly significant: Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.91. For the 54 patients with dementia, the depression score worsens significantly as cognitive disorders worsen. In these patients Marin's scale shows a progression of apathy with the impairment observed in MMS, but the MMS is not correlated with the score at the demotivation scale. So this latter scale seems to measure something close but independent from apathy. DISCUSSION: The loss of motivation is a frequent behavioral disorder in old patients. Loss of motivation can be present in any chronic disease with asthenia. This disorder is frequent in depression, in dementia and even in endocrine disease, for instance hyperthyroidism. It triggers a loss of commitment of old people and paves the way for the loss of autonomy. Apathy is a loss of motivation associated with an affective blunting. Demotivation is congruent with the actual presence of apathy in patients as measured using Marin's scale that has been used as a standard in this study. This paper presents a methodology for an evaluation scale aimed at the loss of motivation in old people. A psychologist and seven different caregivers working in a day care hospital on 98 patients performed an indirect assessment. An estimation of specificity, sensibility, reproducibility and homogeneity was tested with appropriate techniques. The results obtained with this scale answer the preliminary methodological queries, allowing us to trigger further researches for a final validation. According to our results, demotivation does not increase with age neither in demented nor in non-demented patients. Conversely, the aggravation of cognitive disorders in dementia is associated with increasing demotivation and depression. The loss of motivation participates to the learnt and acquired helplessness. Its care is necessarily global, using pharmacological, psychological and sociotherapeutic treatment. CONCLUSION: EAD scale appears a reliable tool to assess loss of motivation in old and very old patients.

T1  - Dimensions of fatigue during radiotherapy. An application of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory
LA  - eng
SN  - 0941-4355
Y1  - 2001/07/
AB  - The aim of the present study was to describe fatigue in a group of irradiated cancer patients. Fatigue was assessed prospectively in 81 Swedish cancer patients, using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), which was also validated in the study, the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and a Borg CR10 scale before curative radiotherapy, at the end of therapy and 1 and 3 months after treatment. The mean age of these patients was 56 years; 90% were female; and 65% were being treated for cancer of the breast. The absorbed radiation dose was 50 Gy or lower in 90% of the patients. A clear peak in experienced fatigue according to the three scales was seen at the end of treatment. In the MFI-20 the dimensions of General fatigue, Physical fatigue and Reduced activity, were more pronounced than the aspects of Mental fatigue and Reduced motivation. Comparison with other studies using the same instrument in other irradiated patients revealed a similar pattern. The internal consistency of the Swedish version of the MFI-20 was good. The MFI-20 is shown to be a valid instrument for assessing fatigue in patients undergoing radiotherapy.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric differences between Parkinson's disease with dementia and Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 0885-6230
Y1  - 2001/02/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the profile of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of a population-based sample of patients with PDD and AD patients matched for age, sex, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. METHOD: Patients were diagnosed according to published criteria for PD and AD. The diagnosis of dementia in PD was made according to DSM-III-R, and was based on clinical interview of the patient and a relative, psychometric testing (including MMSE, Dementia Rating Scale and tests assessing memory, executive functions and visuospatial functioning) and physical examination. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was administered to all patients. RESULTS: One or more psychiatric symptoms was reported in 95% of AD and 83% of PDD patients. Hallucinations were more severe in PD patients, while aberrant motor behavior, agitation, disinhibition, irritability, euphoria, and apathy were more severe in AD. In PDD, apathy was more common in mild Hoehn and Yahr stages, while delusions increased with more severe motor and cognitive disturbances. In PDD, only delusions correlated with the MMSE score. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common and severe in patients with PDD, with important implications for the management of these patients. AD and PDD patients have different neuropsychiatric profiles, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Cognitive impairment, psychopathology, and motor features progress independently in PDD patients

T1  - Peripheral neuropathic pain--a multidimensional burden for patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 1090-3801
Y1  - 2001
AB  - The present study was undertaken to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and burden of illness due to pain and its treatment for patients with peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP). It is the first step in finding reliable instruments/targets to evaluate treatment outcome in this patient population. Study population consisted of 126 patients suffering from neuropathic pain due to a peripheral nerve or root lesion, recruited from two multidisciplinary pain clinics. HRQoL was examined using Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey and Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). Pain intensity in four categories (at rest and evoked by movement, touch and cold) was rated on a visual analogue scale (VAS). Degree of discomfort from pain and 25 symptoms related to pain and side-effects was also assessed. Reduction in workload due to pain was recorded, as was the pain relief from previous and current treatments and the reasons for discontinuing previous treatments. All dimensions in SF-36 and NHP were significantly impaired. SF-36 was a valid instrument for describing the impact of pain on the HRQoL of patients with PNP. NHP had a lower reliability but has other advantages that might be of importance. Many patients experienced poor pain relief from ongoing pain treatments. Most previous treatments were discontinued owing to lack of efficacy and/or severe side-effects. Many patients experienced a high intensity of at least one type of pain; median VAS for the highest pain intensity score of each patient (any type of pain) was 74/100. Besides pain, patients were most bothered by difficulty in sleeping, lack of energy, drowsiness, difficulty in concentrating and dry mouth. Employment status was reduced owing to pain in 52% of the patients. The intense pain, other troublesome symptoms, limited efficacy and tolerability of available treatments, together with the impaired health and reduced work status, amount to a substantial burden for patients with PNP.

T1  - The Korean version of the neuropsychiatric inventory: a scoring tool for neuropsychiatric disturbance in dementia patients
LA  - eng

Y1  - 2000/12/
AB  - The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) is a standardized, validated, and reliable tool to assess neuropsychiatric derangements in dementia patients. The aim of this study is to develop the Korean version of the NPI (K-NPI) and to test its reliability and usefulness in dementia patients. The subjects were 49 normal controls and 92 patients with Alzheimer's disease (43), vascular dementia (32), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (11), and other causes (6). Their caregivers familiar with the subjects' everyday behavior were interviewed with the K-NPI. In a subgroup (29/141) of the caregivers, the K-NPI was repeated for test-retest reliability, average of 23.1 days after the initial test. Prevalence rates of 12 behavioral domains in dementia patients were comparable to those of the original NPI; apathy was the most common and hallucination was the least common behavior. Total K-NPI scores correlated positively with dementia severity assessed with the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination. Test-retest reliabilities of frequencies and severities of all subscales were significantly high. Depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, night-time behavior, and eating change were identified at very low rates in normal controls and were significantly less than those in dementia patients (p<0.001). The K-NPI, whose reliability and competency are comparable to those of the original version, may be a reliable and useful tool for measuring neuropsychiatric disturbances in Korean dementia patients.

T1  - The Geriatric Pain Measure: validity, reliability and factor analysis
LA  - eng
SN  - 0002-8614
Y1  - 2000/12/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain is a multidimensional experience that should be evaluated beyond an estimate of intensity. A multidimensional pain measure has not been developed for older persons undergoing comprehensive geriatric assessment. OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate validity and reliability of a multidimensional pain assessment instrument for older persons. RESEARCH DESIGN: A series of steps in instrument development and evaluation. SUBJECTS: A total of 176 subjects (mean age 84 +/- 6.0 years) in ambulatory geriatric clinics; 64% were women, and 73% had a history of chronic pain. MEASUREMENTS: Measurements included the Geriatric Pain Measure (GPM), the McGill Pain Questionnaire, Yesavage GDS, Katz ADLs, Lawton IADLs, Tinetti Gait and Balance, Folstein MMSE, and other demographic and clinical characteristics from interview and chart review. RESULTS: The GPM demonstrated a standardized alpha = 0.9445, homogeneity ratio =0.457, and average inter-item correlation =0.415. A subgroup of 50 subjects demonstrated concurrent validity of the GPM in comparison with the McGill Pain Questionnaire (Pearson's r correlation 0.6269 (P < .0000). Test-retest reliability was demonstrated in another subgroup of 50 subjects who repeated the GPM within 48 to 72 hours (Pearson's r = 0.9018; P < .0000). Factor analysis revealed five clusters of components: Pain Intensity, Disengagement, Pain with Ambulation, Pain with Strenuous Activities, and Pain with Other Activities. CONCLUSIONS: The GPM is a 24-item questionnaire that is easy to administer and has significant validity and reliability in older persons with multiple medical problems. The GPM may be a useful addition to the multidimensional geriatric assessment process.

T1  - Hosting a wellness day: promoting health in the old-old
LA  - eng
SN  - 1085-2360
Y1  - 2000/11/
AB  - The purpose of health promotion and disease prevention is to increase the number of years of life and ensure better quality of remaining life. Those in the oldest age group (> or = 90 years) are generally less likely to monitor their cholesterol intake, exercise, have their stools checked for occult blood, or undergo a mammogram, Papanicolaou test, or prostate or skin evaluation as recommended. The most common reasons given for not engaging in these activities are advanced age, absence of direction by primary health care providers, and lack of interest in following up abnormal findings. To promote primary and secondary disease prevention and health promotion, a Wellness Day was hosted in a continuing-care retirement community by the in-house geriatric nurse practitioner and a group of nurse practitioner students. The program offered cancer screening, cardiovascular health assessments, and exercise prescreening and education, as well as screening for diabetes and risk for osteoporosis. An individualized approach to health promotion was used, reviewing with each resident the pros and cons of participating in each of these behaviors.

T1  - Dementia with lewy bodies: findings from an international multicentre study
LA  - eng
SN  - 0885-6230
Y1  - 2000/11/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the baseline demographic, neuropsychiatric and neurological data of a large selected clinical sample of patients with dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) from an international multicentre trial with rivastigmine. To examine the usefulness of the Consensus Criteria for the diagnosis of DLB in different countries. METHODS: Seventeen centres from Spain, the UK and Italy recruited patients diagnosed clinically as probable DLB according to recent Consensus Criteria (McKeith et al., 1996). A standard clinical protocol including inclusion/exclusion criteria, collection of demographic and medical data, cognitive (Mini Mental State Examination: MMSE), motor (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale: UPDRS) and neuropsychiatric (Neuropsychiatric Inventory: NPI) examinations, was applied after obtaining informed consent. Data were summarised and compared across countries with uni- and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients were recruited: 56.7% males, mean (SD) age 73.9 (6.4) years, range 57 - 87 years. Sixty percent fulfilled all three core diagnostic features of DLB, and 40% only two ('parkinsonism' 92.4%, 'cognitive fluctuations' 89.1%, 'visual hallucinations' 77.3%). 'Systematised delusions' (46%) and 'repeated falls' (42%) were the most frequent supportive diagnostic features. There were no differences across countries in demographic, diagnostic or clinical features. Patients showed a wide range of psychopathology which was weakly correlated with cognitive impairment. Some mild extrapyramidal signs (EPS) were observed in most patients. CONCLUSIONS: The Consensus Criteria for DLB can be consistently applied across many different sites for multicentre studies. 'Parkinsonism' and 'cognitive fluctuations' as core features and 'systematised delusions' and 'repeated falls' as supportive features are the most frequent diagnostic clues. Neuropsychiatric disturbances, in particular apathy, delusions, hallucinations and anxiety, and mild symmetric EPS are frequent in DLB and are only related weakly to cognitive impairment.

T1  - Psychological constructs associated with emotional blood pressure response and white coat phenomenon
LA  - eng
SN  - 0393-9340
Y1  - 2000///Oct-Dec
AB  - Some hypertensive and non-hypertensive subjects have a striking blood pressure response to a medical environment (white coat phenomenon), although it is unlikely that its presence, degree, and duration can be routinely predicted. Despite the common observation that "anxious" patients may present with this reaction when a physician measures their blood pressure, no psychological variables have thus far been linked to white coat phenomenon in formal analyses. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a useful tool to disclose the phenomenon since it allows precise evaluation of repeated blood pressure measurements outside the medical environment. To investigate the possible relationship between psychological profile and white coat phenomenon, we have planned to administer a series of psychometric tests to 120 subjects undergoing ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The present data are derived from an analysis of the first set of 70 patients. Thirty-four subjects who presented with white coat phenomenon (defined as office blood pressure elevated by at least 15% over the mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure value) and 36 comparable subjects who did not have this reaction underwent a series of psychometric tests evaluating cognitive behavior, hostility, cynicism, anger, anxiety state, coping ability and strategies, and quality of life. Of the various psychometric tests, the scores of three relevant scales (healthcare-related fears, mental efficiency and behavioral disengagement) were significantly higher in the group of patients with white coat phenomenon, while in both groups, emotional instability was higher than the clinical cut-off point. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding signs and repression of anger (anger-out and anger-in), cynicism, hostility, or anxiety state. Our data seem to indicate that the subjects most likely to show an overt blood pressure increase in the medical environment are those who evidence healthcare-related fears and emotional instability but are not necessarily anxious. They exhibit high coping skills in cognitive resolution of stressing situations (such as blood pressure measurement) but do not combine these strategies with an adequate behavioral response and do not feel that behavioral involvement is necessary for the management of their clinical condition.

T1  - The nature of the depressive symptomatology preceding myocardial infarction
LA  - eng
SN  - 0896-4289
Y1  - 2000///Summer
AB  - Little is known about the nature of the depressive symptomatology preceding myocardial infarction (MI). Specification of the depressive symptomatology is important for the development of hypotheses about the biological mechanisms relating depressive symptoms to MI. To test the hypothesis that feelings of fatigue and loss of energy have the strongest predictive power of all depressive symptoms, the authors reanalyzed data from a prospective study of 3877 healthy men aged 40 to 65 years. The men's mental state was assessed using the Maastricht Questionnaire, a scale that measures vital exhaustion, which is characterized by unusual fatigue and lack of energy, increased irritability, and depressive symptoms, including demoralization. Oblique factor analysis was used to validate these dimensions. Results of Cox's regression analyses showed that the fatigue subscale has the strongest predictive power for incident MI and that depression and irritability subscales lose their predictive power when controlled for fatigue.

T1  - The Frontal Behavioral Inventory in the differential diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 1355-6177
Y1  - 2000/05/
AB  - A personality and behavioral disorder is an important and defining feature of frontal lobe dementia (FLD) or frontotemporal degeneration (FTD). The diagnosis usually depends on the progressive development of various behavioral symptoms rather than a set of neuropsychological measures. Quantification of the personality-behavior disorder is important for standardizing the diagnosis. An inventory was constructed to capture the major positive and negative behaviors and personality change, and it was administered prospectively to caregivers of 108 patients in a cognitive neurology clinic, at the time of first diagnostic assessment. The prevalence and extent of behavioral abnormality was quantitated in the clinic population of FLD, vascular dementia (VaD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), primary progressive aphasia (PPA), and depressive disorder (DD) patients. The mean scores of FLD patients were significantly above all other groups. Scores in VaD were also higher than in AD, PPA, and DD. Interrater reliability (Cohen's kappa of .90) and item consistency (a Cronbach alpha of .89) were both high. Perseveration, indifference, inattention, inappropriateness, and loss of insight rated highest in FLD, significantly different from all other groups. Apathy, aspontaneity, inflexibility, disorganization, impulsivity, personal neglect, and poor judgment were also significantly higher in FLD. Discriminant function correctly classified 92.7% versus all other patients (NON-FLD) in the study. A total of 18.8% of VaD patients were misclassified as FLD. Indifference, alien hand, and inappropriateness were the highest discriminant functions. Perseveration and verbal apraxia were important discriminatory items for FLD and PPA, respectively. The FBI is a standardized behavioral inventory useful to diagnose FLD, to differentiate it from other dementias, and to quantify the behavior disorder.

T1  - Mental and behavioral disturbances in dementia: findings from the Cache County Study on Memory in Aging
LA  - eng
SN  - 0002-953X
Y1  - 2000/05/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors report findings from a study of 5,092 community residents who constituted 90% of the elderly resident population of Cache County, Utah. METHOD: The 5,092 participants, who were 65 years old or older, were screened for dementia. Based on the results of this screen, 1,002 participants (329 with dementia and 673 without dementia) underwent comprehensive neuropsychiatric examinations and were rated on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, a widely used method for ascertainment and classification of dementia-associated mental and behavioral disturbances. RESULTS: Of the 329 participants with dementia, 214 (65%) had Alzheimer's disease, 62 (19%) had vascular dementia, and 53 (16%) had another DSM-IV dementia diagnosis; 201 (61%) had exhibited one or more mental or behavioral disturbances in the past month. Apathy (27%), depression (24%), and agitation/aggression (24%) were the most common in participants with dementia. These disturbances were almost four times more common in participants with dementia than in those without. Only modest differences were observed in the prevalence of mental or behavioral disturbances in different types of dementia or at different stages of illness: participants with Alzheimer's disease were more likely to have delusions and less likely to have depression. Agitation/aggression and aberrant motor behavior were more common in participants with advanced dementia. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of their findings in this large community population of elderly people, the authors conclude that a wide range of dementia-associated mental and behavioral disturbances afflict the majority of individuals with dementia. Because of their frequency and their adverse effects on patients and their caregivers, these disturbances should be ascertained and treated in all cases of dementia.

T1  - Coping, mood, and aspects of personality in Spanish translation and evidence of convergence with English versions
LA  - eng
SN  - 0022-3891
Y1  - 2000/02/
AB  - Research on stress and its influence on health and well-being has flourished for several decades, examining as predictors such psychosocial variables as personality and coping. This work now often targets multiethnic samples. Because many potential participants lack facility in English, a need exists for translations of measures into other languages. We translated 6 instruments into Spanish and studied their characteristics. Of these, 3 were measures of personality qualities: the Life Orientation Test--Revised (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994), the Behavioral Inhibition/Behavioral Activation Scales (Carver & White, 1994), and the Measure of Body Apperception (Carver et al., 1998). The others were the Brief COPE (Carver, 1997), the Center for Epidemiological Studies--Depression Scale (Radloff, 1977), and an abbreviated version of the Profile of Mood States (McNair, Lorr, & Droppelman, 1971). Correlations between English and Spanish versions in bilingual samples were all above. 72, except for the COPE's Behavioral Disengagement scale. Alpha reliabilities of the Spanish versions were comparable to those of the English versions. Correlations among measures in a sample of cancer patients were similar across languages.

T1  - Outcomes of trauma patients who survive prolonged lengths of stay in the intensive care unit
LA  - eng
SN  - 0022-5282
Y1  - 2000/02/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine a subgroup of severely injured patients spending > or = 3 weeks in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to determine their disposition and eventual functional outcome. METHODS: A retrospective review of our trauma registry and medical records over a 7-year period (January of 1991 to December of 1997) identified 115 patients with ICU length of stay (LOS) > or = 3 weeks. Variables selected included age, length of stay, injury severity score, injuries, disposition, and charges. Functional independence measures (FIM) were obtained in patients requiring inpatient rehabilitation and a written questionnaire (Rand 36-item Health Survey) was mailed to all patients alive at discharge. RESULTS: Mean ICU length of stay of the 115 patients was 36 days (range, 21-106 days); mean age, 49 years (range, 4-89 years); 73 patients (63%) were males, 42 patients (37%) were females. Overall mortality was 22% (n = 25). The remaining 90 patients survived to discharge with the following disposition: rehabilitation facility 60% (n = 54), home with temporary disability 22% (n = 20), nursing home 8% (n = 7), home with permanent disability 4% (n = 4), transferred 6% (n = 5). Mean hospital charge was $193,000 (range, $77,000-$528,000). No variable or combination could predict outcome except age. Elderly patients (age > or = 75, n = 24) had an overall mortality of 42% (n = 10). Eight of 14 survivors fulfilled admission criteria and entered our rehabilitation facility. The remaining six elderly patients either went to nursing homes or were permanently disabled. Complete FIM scores were available on 47 of 54 patients who went to rehabilitation facility. The mean rehabilitation facility admission FIM score was 52, indicating either complete dependence or the need for moderate assistance. After they had remained at the rehabilitation facility for a mean of 48 days (range, 7-278 days), patients' FIM scores improved to a mean of 86, signifying minimal contact assistance or supervision only. Three-month follow-up FIM scores continued to improve to a mean of 101, a score denoting complete independence. Elderly patients within the rehabilitation facility fared as well as the younger group. For the Rand-36 survey, 47 of 90 patients or family members were contacted. Twelve patients died since discharge, leaving 35 patients to complete the survey. Despite excellent FIM scores, overall mean health was only fair to good, with limitations to activity and lack of energy cited as the main problems. CONCLUSION: Despite tremendous resource utilization, the majority of trauma patients with prolonged ICU stays can eventually return to varying degrees of functional daily living and independence, but not to preinjury levels. A subgroup of severely injured elderly patients had a significantly higher mortality rate. However, elderly survivors that entered our rehabilitation facility fared as well as the younger patients.

T1  - Distress attributed to negative symptoms in schizophrenia
LA  - eng
SN  - 0586-7614
Y1  - 2000
AB  - The purpose of the study was to examine (1) to which negative symptoms schizophrenia patients attribute distress and (2) whether clinical variables can predict the levels of reported distress. With the help of a research assistant, 86 hospitalized patients completed a self-rating scale for negative symptoms. The 21 items of the self-rating scale were taken from the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). A psychiatrist rated the patients on a number of scales, including the SANS. When patients reported particular symptoms, they were asked whether those symptoms bothered or distressed them. Answers to this question were highly dependent on the type of symptom involved. Distress was most often attributed to symptoms in the subscale avolition-apathy. Patients were also asked how much they were bothered or distressed. Again, high levels of distress were most often attributed to items in the subscale avolition-apathy. A summary score was developed for the level of reported distress: the distress score. Regression analysis showed that distress scores were not associated with the observed severity of negative symptoms or with the level of psychiatric disability. High distress scores were best predicted by the combination of high scores for depression and high scores for insight into positive symptomatology. However, this model explained only a quarter of the variance in distress scores.

T1  - The use of the neuropsychiatric inventory in nursing home residents. Characterization and measurement
LA  - eng
SN  - 1064-7481
Y1  - 2000///Winter
AB  - The authors assessed the validity of the nursing home version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home Version (NPI-NH), comparing the responses of certified nurses' aides (CNAs) and licensed vocational nurses (LVNs) with research observations. Correlations were significant but moderate for all of the domains of the NPI-NH (delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression, apathy, disinhibition, euphoria, irritability/lability, and aberrant motor disturbances) except anxiety and appetite disturbance. The LVNs' ratings showed consistently higher correlations with the researchers' behavioral observations than did the CNAs', but were moderate and generally better for residents with high levels of neuropsychiatric symptoms, thus, caution should be used with any untrained rater in the nursing home setting. The NPI-NH used by non-research staff can be useful in identifying residents with significant neuropsychiatric disturbances, but may be limited as an instrument for tracking behavioral changes.

T1  - The interrelations between psychosis, behavioral disturbance, and depression in Alzheimer disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 0893-0341
Y1  - 1999/11/
AB  - Behavioral changes are common in Alzheimer disease (AD), and heterogeneous in their presentation. Subtle personality changes tend to occur early; these include apathy, irritability and inability to pay attention. Later agitation, aggression and disinhibited behaviors may appear. We have utilized the Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer's Disease to monitor a number of behavioral symptoms in 235 patients with early probable AD. Markov analyses were used to predict the probability of developing or retaining a given symptom at 6-month follow-up. The results show that the symptoms of psychopathology in AD fluctuate with time. Agitation was both the most frequent and persistent symptom, while paranoid delusions and hallucinations were less persistent. Most behavioral disturbances, except paranoid delusions, were associated with greater cognitive impairment. There was no association between depressive features and either cognitive or functional impairment. These results have important implications for the optimal treatment of the psychopathological symptoms of AD.

T1  - The spectrum of behavioral responses to cholinesterase inhibitor therapy in Alzheimer disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 0003-9942
Y1  - 1999/11/
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behavioral abnormalities are common in Alzheimer disease (AD); cholinergic treatment reduces the behavioral disturbances of some patients with AD. Characterizing the pretreatment profile of patients who are likely to respond to cholinergic therapy will aid the efficient use of clinical resources. OBJECTIVE: To determine the baseline behavioral profile for 86 patients with AD treated with the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil hydrochloride. METHODS: Open-label retrospective study of treatment-related behavioral assessments. Based on previous double-blind placebo-controlled experience using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), patients were divided into responder (> or =4-point total NPI score decrease, indicating improvement), unchanged (+/-3-point total NPI score change), or nonresponder (> or =4-point total NPI score increase, indicating worsening) groups. The Mini-Mental State Examination assessed cognitive response. RESULTS: Behavioral improvement was seen in 35 patients (41%), worsening in 24 (28%), and no change in 27 (31%). Comparison of profiles in behavioral responders vs nonresponders revealed significantly worse delusions (P = .04), agitation (P = .04), depression (P = .006), anxiety (P = .02), apathy (P = .003), disinhibition (P = .02), and irritability (P<.001) at baseline in responders. Five behaviors changed significantly from baseline, improving for the responders and worsening for the nonresponders: delusions (P = .003 for nonresponders, P = .004 for responders), agitation (P = .01), anxiety (P = .006 for nonresponders, P = .004 for responders), disinhibition (P = .02 for nonresponders, P = .05 for responders), and irritability (P = .003 for nonresponders, P = .001 for responders). The behavioral changes were dose dependent. Cognition did not change significantly with donepezil treatment within any group. CONCLUSIONS: Donepezil has psychotropic properties, and pretreatment behaviors help predict patients' responses to treatment.

T1  - Quality of life assessment in MND: development of a social withdrawal scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 0022-510X
Y1  - 1999/10/31
AB  - A scale to measure 'social withdrawal,' was developed specifically for use with MND patients. Scale design was based upon patient-focused interviews which were used to explore patients' concerns. The impact the condition had upon their social interactions with others was salient for all patients and affected their overall quality of life. Using issues raised by patients, a 23-item scale was generated to specifically and quantitatively measure social withdrawal and this scale was psychometrically evaluated. The scale was administered to a sample of 23 patients at varied stages of progression of MND, and to a control group of patients with arthritis with similar levels of physical disability. For MND patients withdrawal from the community was found to be closely related to severity of physical symptoms and depression. Specific patients were identified who are particularly susceptible to withdrawal and depression. Comparison of the pattern of withdrawal in the MND and arthritis patient groups suggested that there may be differences between the factors governing social withdrawal in different patient populations.

AB  - Fatigue describes reduced capacity to sustain force or power output, reduced capacity to perform multiple tasks over time and simply a subjective experience of feeling exhausted, tired, weak or having lack of energy. Pain and fatigue have several components in common, such as being subjective, prevalent in most patients with cancer and caused by multiple factors of both a physical and psychological nature. In order to explore the relationship between fatigue and pain, data from five studies were used: two random samples from the Norwegian population (n=2323 and n=1965), Hodgkin's disease survivors (n=459), palliative care patients (n=434) and patients with bone metastases (n=94). All patients had completed one or more of the following instruments: EORTC QLQ-C30, SF-36 and/or Fatigue Questionnaire. The level of fatigue was much higher in the two palliative care populations (54.4 and 63.2) as compared to the normal population samples (25.0). Patients with bone metastases had significantly more pain (72.0) than the patients in the palliative care trial (47.4) and norms (20.5). In the two palliative care and bone metastases populations fatigue was almost unchanged over time, while pain was reduced. In the palliative care population a high level of fatigue (80.3) and pain (57.8) was reported 0-1 month before death. The relationship between pain, fatigue and the health-related quality of life domains should be explored in more detail, especially in follow-up studies in order to assess possible changes over time. In addition, the validity of the existing instruments measuring fatigue should be investigated for use in patients with advanced disease and short life expectancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of the Spanish (Spain) version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Neuropsychiatric Inventory was administered to the caregivers of 63 subjects from the Dementia Unit, Hospital Santa Caterina, Girona. All patients had detailed neuropsychological assessment, and their non-cognitive symptoms were also examined with the CAMDEX. RESULTS: There was a high level of internal consistency reliability. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory subscores correlated with those of the CAMDEX, indicating an acceptable level of validity. The most frequent symptom was apathy (56%), followed by irritability (38%), depression/dysphoria (35%), aberrant motor behavior (30%), agitation/aggression (29%), anxiety (27%), disinhibition (24%), delusions (19%), hallucinations (14%) and euphoria (3%). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the Spanish version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory is a reliable instrument, which can briefly assess non-cognitive symptoms in demented patients. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory is a useful instrument for research and clinical practice in different culture around the world.

T1  - Psychopathology in the Dogon Plateau: an assessment using the QDSM and principal components analysis
LA  - eng
SN  - 0933-7954
Y1  - 1999/05/
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present paper reports the findings of principal components analysis performed on the basis of answers to the Questionnaire pour le Depistage en Santé Mentale (QDSM) administered to subjects from the Bandiagara plateau (Mali), who had been evaluated in a previously published report. METHODS: The study sample was made up of 466 subjects (253 males, 213 females), 273 of whom belonged to the Dogon ethnic group, 163 were Peul and the remaining 30 belonged to other groups (Sonrai, Bozo, Tuareg, Bambara). All subjects were submitted to QDSM, a structured interview derived from the Self Reporting Questionnaire. Data obtained were processed by means of principal components analysis, in order to obtain syndromic aggregations. RESULTS: Eight factors with an Eigen value greater than 1 were extracted, which provided sufficient explanation for the overall variance observed among the 23 items. These factors may be termed as follows: Sadness (factor 1); Dysphoria (factor 2); Nightmares (factor 3); Persecution (factor 4); Somatic symptoms (factor 5); Special powers (factor 6); Hopelessness (factor 7); Loss of Interest (factor 8). CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study support the hypothesis of an independence of "psychosomatic" from depressive symptoms. In particular, contrary to some evidence derived from other African studies, the present research appears to suggest a possible counterposition of these two ways of expressing depression, commonly considered as autonomous.

T1  - Development of the EURO-D scale--a European, Union initiative to compare symptoms of depression in 14 European centres
LA  - eng
SN  - 0007-1250
Y1  - 1999/04/
AB  - BACKGROUND: In an 11-country European collaboration, 14 population-based surveys included 21,724 subjects aged > or = 65 years. Most participating centres used the Geriatric Mental State (GMS), but other measures were also used. AIMS: To derive from these instruments a common depression symptoms scale, the EURO-D, to allow comparison of risk factor profiles between centres. METHOD: Common items were identified from the instruments. Algorithms for fitting items to GMS were derived by observation of item correspondence or expert opinion. The resulting 12-item scale was checked for internal consistency, criterion validity and uniformity of factor-analytic profile. RESULTS: The EURO-D is internally consistent, capturing the essence of its parent instrument. A two-factor solution seemed appropriate: depression, tearfulness and wishing to die loaded on the first factor (affective suffering), and loss of interest, poor concentration and lack of enjoyment on the second (motivation). CONCLUSIONS: The EURO-D scale should permit valid comparison of risk-factor associations between centres, even if between-centre variation remains difficult to attribute.

T1  - Fatigue and other symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: do women and men differ?
LA  - eng
SN  - 0884-2175
Y1  - 1999///Mar-Apr
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Describe the symptoms experienced by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), compare women and men with regard to their physical and psychologic symptoms, and determine the predictors of fatigue for the group as a whole and for women separately. DESIGN: Correlational, predictive. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred four (48 women/56 men) outpatients with severe COPD and a mean age of 60 years. MEASURES: Self-report of fatigue using the SF-36 energy/fatigue subscale and a "lack of energy" question. Self-report of dyspnea, general symptoms using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, and psychologic symptoms using the Brief Symptom Inventory. Pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gas levels. RESULTS: Patients reported a moderate level of fatigue (mean of 44 on the SF-36), with no difference in the reports of men and women. When reporting their "lack of energy" during the past week, women reported more fatigue than did men. Other symptoms in descending order of reporting were dyspnea and cough. More women reported "don't look like myself" than did men. Women and men were similar in their psychologic symptoms except anxiety, which was higher in women (t = 2.64, p < .01). Predictors of fatigue (SF-36 subscale) for the group as a whole were found to be dyspnea and physical symptoms, predicting 42% of the variance. For the women alone, dyspnea and physical symptoms entered the equation, to predict 67% of the variance in fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Predictors of fatigue were similar for women compared to the group as a whole, with symptoms having more of an impact on fatigue than did physiologic variables.

T1  - The clinical picture of frontotemporal dementia: diagnosis and follow-up
LA  - eng
SN  - 1420-8008
Y1  - 1999
AB  - Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) was diagnosed in 74 outpatients with a standardized assessment including neuropsychological tests, behavioural scale, structural and functional imaging. Clinical characteristics were consistent with the literature data. The cohort was followed for 2-6 years to determine the reliable variable for evaluating the progression of FTD. Every fourth patient died after a mean duration of 7 years. At first, FTD manifests itself in behavioural changes with relatively stable global cognition although language, verbal fluency and memory tests were reliable tools to follow the progression of the disease. Below 18 of Mini-Mental State Examination, mutism and apathy prevented from neuropsychological testing within the next 6 months. Behavioural disorders evolved with time but restlessness and hyperorality were long-lasting. Imaging showed the progression of a consistent pattern of anterior abnormalities with frequent leukoaraiosis.

T1  - Mechanisms underlying diminished novelty-seeking behavior in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 0894-878X
Y1  - 1999/01/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To better understand apathy and disengagement in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the authors investigated possible behavioral mechanisms underlying diminished novelty-seeking activity in patients with probable AD. BACKGROUND: Apathy and disengagement have been shown to be the most common behavioral changes associated with AD. METHOD: Patients and age-matched normal controls had their eye movements recorded while pairs of line drawings pitting an incongruous figure against a congruous figure were shown on a screen for 12 seconds. Characteristics of a subset of AD patients who were indifferent to novel visual stimuli as measured by exploratory eye movements were compared to those of a subset of AD patients who were attracted to novel stimuli to a degree similar to that of normal controls. RESULTS: The indifferent patients were judged by informants, who completed a personality questionnaire, to exhibit a greater degree of apathy. The two AD groups did not differ in overall dementia severity or performance on a Saccade-to-Target Task that required shifts of attention and gaze. In a separate task, the indifferent patients were able to accurately identify the more novel stimuli in 97.5% of trials. Normal control subjects exhibited a strong bias toward processing novel stimuli, directing a higher proportion of their first fixations and dwell time to the incongruous stimuli whether the analysis was run for 3, 6, or 12 seconds of viewing. Indifferent patients did not direct their initial fixation toward novel stimuli and distributed their looking time evenly between incongruous and congruous stimuli throughout all measured intervals. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the indifference to novelty observed in some patients with probable AD cannot simply be attributed to global cognitive decline, more elementary attentional deficits, more rapid habituation of response to novel stimuli, or an inability to discriminate upon demand between stimuli of varying degrees of novelty. It is more likely that their behavior reflects a disruption, by AD pathology, of neural systems that modulate behavioral engagement and maintain attentional bias toward novel events in the environment.

T1  - Presentation and stability of noncognitive symptom patterns in patients with Alzheimer disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 0893-0341
Y1  - 1998/12/
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate noncognitive symptoms in Alzheimer disease to identify symptom patterns and to study stability of such patterns prospectively. Furthermore, variables were examined that could be associated with certain types of symptom patterns or could be predictors of change of these patterns. Forty-eight patients with the clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer disease were included in this study and were assessed weekly over a 3-week period. Noncognitive symptoms were rated according to the Behavioral Abnormalities in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale and the Dementia Mood Assessment Scale and to a set of items that specifically assess misidentifications. By means of principal component factor analysis different noncognitive symptom patterns were obtained, yielding a four-factor solution. They mapped onto rational domains with respect to clinical experience: depression, apathy, psychotic symptoms/aggression, and misidentifications/agitation. Demographic and clinical variables were not associated with the factor solutions and did not predict change of the factor values. The results demonstrate that in Alzheimer disease there are distinct noncognitive symptom patterns that hold at least short-term prospective stability. None of the examined clinical variables, such as age at entry, the status of the patients (outpatient or inpatient), or dementia severity, exerted substantial influence on the noncognitive symptom patterns. Further investigations should concentrate on the pathological and prognostic correlates of noncognitive symptom patterns in Alzheimer disease.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric features of corticobasal degeneration
LA  - eng
SN  - 0022-3050
SN  - 1468-330X
Y1  - 1998/11/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterise the neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients with corticobasal degeneration (CBD). METHODS: The neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI), a tool with established validity and reliability, was administered to 15 patients with CBD (mean (SEM), age 67.9 (2) years); 34 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (66.6 (1.2) years); and 25 controls (70 (0.8) years), matched for age and education. Both patient groups had similar duration of symptoms and mini mental state examination scores. Semantic fluency and motor impairment were also assessed. RESULTS: Patients with CBD exhibited depression (73%), apathy (40%), irritability (20%), and agitation (20%) but less often had anxiety, disinhibition, delusions, or aberrant motor behaviour (for example, pacing). The depression and irritability of patients with CBD were more frequent and severe than those of patients with PSP. Conversely, patients with PSP exhibited significantly more apathy than patients with CBD. The presence of high depression and irritability and low apathy scale scores correctly differentiated the patients with CBD 88% of the time. The irritability of patients with CBD was significantly associated with disinhibition (r=0.85) and apathy (r=0.72). In CBD, apathy was associated with disinhibition (r=0.67); disinhibition was associated with aberrant motor behaviour (r=0.68) and apathy (r=0.67); and aberrant motor behaviour with delusions (r=1.0). On the other hand, depression was not associated with any other behaviour, suggesting that it has a different pathophysiological mechanism. Symptom duration was associated with total motor scores (r=0.69). However, total motor score was not associated with any behaviour or cognitive scores. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that frontosubcortical pathways mediating cognition, emotion, and motor function in CBD are not affected in parallel. Patients with CBD and PSP have overlapping neuropsychiatric manifestations, but they express distinctive symptom profiles. Evaluating the behavioural abnormalities of parkinsonian patients may help clarify the role of the basal ganglia in behaviour.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric assessment of patients with hyperkinetic and hypokinetic movement disorders
LA  - eng
SN  - 0003-9942
Y1  - 1998/10/
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of the basal ganglia in neuropsychiatric behaviors is not well known. Anatomical, neurophysiological, and neurochemical evidence supports the notion of parallel direct and indirect basal ganglia thalamocortical motor systems, the differential involvement of which accounts for the hypokinesia or hyperkinesia observed in basal ganglia disorders. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the neuropsychiatric manifestations of patients with a hyperkinetic movement disorder, such as Huntington disease (HD), vs a hypokinetic disease, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). To verify if patients with HD show a greater frequency of hyperactive behaviors (eg, agitation, irritation, euphoria, or anxiety), while those with PSP exhibit hypoactive behaviors (eg, apathy). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Neuropsychiatric Inventory, a tool with established validity and reliability, was administered to 29 patients with HD (mean +/- SD age, 43.8 +/- 2 years) and 34 with PSP (mean +/- SD age, 66.6 +/- 1.2 years), matched for education, symptom duration, and overall degree of dementia. RESULTS: There was no difference between the groups in the total Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores. However, there was a double dissociation in behaviors: patients with HD exhibited significantly more agitation (45%), irritability (38%), and anxiety (34%), whereas patients with PSP exhibited more apathy (82%) (P < .01). Euphoria was present only in patients with HD. CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients with HD manifested predominantly hyperactive behaviors, while those with PSP manifested hypoactive behaviors. Based on our findings and the anatomical lesions known to occur in these disorders, we suggest that the hyperactive behaviors in HD are secondary to an excitatory subcortical output through the medial and orbitofrontal cortical circuits, while in PSP the hypoactive behaviors are secondary to hypostimulation.

T1  - Cognitive and behavioral differentiation of frontal lobe degeneration of the non-Alzheimer type and Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1420-8008
Y1  - 1998///Jul-Aug
AB  - Neuropsychological differences between 14 patients with a clinical diagnosis of frontal lobe degeneration of non-Alzheimer type (FLD) and 15 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) were studied. The most efficient psychometric predictors of FLD were Digit Symbol, estimation tasks, word list recall, and particularly the FAS word fluency test. Behavioral predictors of FLD and AD showed a double dissociation: regression and impulsivity characterized FLD, whereas lack of motivation and slowness were typical of AD. Cognitive and behavioral differences between groups were not related to the degree of dementia, as measured by Mini Mental State Examination, indicating that differences remained during progression of the diseases.

T1  - The factor structure of the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia among probable Alzheimer's disease patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 1064-7481
Y1  - 1998///Summer
AB  - The authors rated 137 outpatients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) on the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) as part of routine evaluation. Principal-factors analysis with varimax rotation resulted in a four-factor solution that accounted for 43.1% of the common variance. The four factors included general depression (lack of reactivity to pleasant events, poor self-esteem, pessimism, loss of interest, physical complaints, psychomotor retardation, sadness); rhythm disturbances (difficulty falling asleep, multiple night awakenings, early morning awakenings, weight loss, diurnal variation of mood); agitation/psychosis (agitation, mood-congruent delusions, suicide); and negative symptoms (appetite loss, weight loss, lack of energy, loss of interest, lack of reactivity to pleasant events). The observed factor structure showed moderate concordance with the five symptom clusters proposed in the original presentation of the CSDD.

T1  - Invisible residents: the chronically mentally ill elderly in nursing homes
LA  - eng
SN  - 0883-9417
Y1  - 1998/06/
AB  - This article presents results from a retrospective study of psychological assessments of elderly persons with chronic mental illness residing in nursing homes. All residents (N = 570) received this assessment as part of federally mandated screening for mentally ill persons residing in long-term care. The process, the Preadmission Screening and Resident Review, was mandated by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA 87). These assessments were the first stage in a process to determine if the nursing home was the most appropriate placement for each resident. If nursing home care was deemed appropriate, then a psychological treatment program was to be established within the nursing home setting. The sample ranged in age from 50 to 104 (mean of 70). The majority had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and a history of psychiatric hospitalization occurring early in their life. The assessments did not include any quantifiable data on activities of daily living, cognitive functioning, or level of psychiatric impairment. Therefore, the researchers coded the narrative data so that it could be interpreted. The majority functioned within the none-to-mild range of cognitive impairment, and very few were completely dependent in the need for physical care. The most recorded symptom was social withdrawal. Neuroleptic medications were administered to 64% of elderly persons with chronic mental illness. Importantly, there was no relationship between demographic or clinical information and treatment recommendations. Implications of these findings for psychiatric nurses are discussed.

T1  - Use of the Apathy Evaluation Scale as a measure of motivation in elderly people
LA  - eng
SN  - 0278-4807
Y1  - 1998///May-Jun
AB  - Motivation plays an important part in an elderly individual's ability to recover from a disabling event. On the other hand, apathy is a lack of motivation. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is an 18-item instrument that rates a person's thoughts, actions, and emotions over the previous 4 weeks. The purpose of this study was to use the AES with 102 patients in a geriatric rehabilitation program to determine if it predicted improved function after rehabilitation. In addition, a short 7-item version of the AES was tested. A strong correlation was demonstrated between the 18-item AES and the 7-item AES, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and the Geriatric Depression Scale. In separate regression analyses, we found that admission function and both the 18-item and 7-item AES were significant predictors of discharge function, and that functional level at admission to rehabilitation accounted for 31% of the variance in function after rehabilitation. The findings suggest that the AES might be an appropriate measure of motivation in older adults and might predict success in rehabilitation. Moreover, the ability to identify patients with low motivation can alert healthcare providers to develop interventions to improve older adults' motivation and help them attain and maintain their highest functional level.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate noncognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease in order to identify symptom patterns and to study stability of such patterns prospectively. Furthermore, variables were examined which could be associated with certain types of symptom patterns or could be predictors of change of these patterns. Forty-eight patients with the clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease were included in this study and were assessed weekly over a three-week period. Noncognitive symptoms were rated according to the Behavioral Abnormalities in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD) and the Dementia Mood Assessment Scale (DMAS) and to a set of items specifically assessing misidentifications. By means of principal component factor analysis different noncognitive symptom patterns were obtained yielding a four-factor solution. They were mapped as rational domains with respect to clinical experience: 'depression', 'apathy', 'psychotic symptoms/aggression', 'misidentifications/agitation'. Demographic and clinical variables were not associated with the factor solutions and did not predict change of the factor values. The results demonstrate that in Alzheimer's disease there are distinct noncognitive symptom patterns with at least short-term prospective stability. None of the examined clinical variables, such as age at entry, the status of the patients (outpatient or inpatient) or dementia severity, exerted substantial influence on the noncognitive symptom patterns. Further investigations should concentrate on the pathological and prognostical correlates of noncognitive symptom patterns in Alzheimer's disease.

T1  - Behavioral disorders in Alzheimer disease: a transcultural perspective
LA  - eng
SN  - 0003-9942
Y1  - 1998/04/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare 2 samples of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), from Italy and the United States, in order to determine transcultural differences in the manifestation of noncognitive symptoms. To analyze the concurrent validity, internal consistency reliability, between-rater reliability, and test-retest reliability of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Scale (NPI). METHODS: The NPI was given to 50 Italian and 50 US patients with AD. To demonstrate the validity and reliability of the Italian version of the instrument, several different methods of analysis were used. The total score on the NPI and the score of single items in the different stages of the disease were compared in the 2 samples of patients. RESULTS: A high level of internal consistency reliability was confirmed, the between-rater reliability was very high, and the test-retest reliability was significantly correlated. Apathy was the most frequently recorded behavior in the Italian sample. Five of 10 NPI item scores showed a significant relation with the Mini-Mental State Examination scores in both samples. The Italian patients showed an increasing and significantly higher mean NPI total score at all levels of dementia severity when compared with the US patients. The scores on some NPI subscales, such as apathy, aberrant motor behavior, disinhibition, and agitation, were significant higher in Italian patients at different levels of severity covarying with educational level. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that NPI is a reliable instrument with which to study transcultural differences in the presentation of neuropsychiatric disturbances in patients with AD. The described similar pattern of behaviors between Italians and US patients with AD suggests a biological origin of the disorders. However, cultural influences must be taken in account when the focus of the study is on psychopathological aspects of dementia.

T1  - Assessing the impact of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease: the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Caregiver Distress Scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 0002-8614
Y1  - 1998/02/
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop an adjunct scale to the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) for assessing the impact of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients on caregiver distress. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive and correlational study. SETTING: University out-patient memory disorders clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-five AD subjects and their caregivers (54 spouses, 31 children). MEASUREMENTS: The NPI and NPI Caregiver Distress Scale (NPI-D) were used to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD patients and related caregiver distress, respectively. Criterion validity of the NPI-D was examined (N = 69) by comparison with an abridged version of the Relatives' Stress Scale (RSS'), a general measure of caregiver stress, using item clusters that had previously been correlated to behavioral disturbances in demented patients. Test-retest (n = 20) and inter-rater reliability (n = 16) of the NPI-D were also assessed. RESULTS: Test-retest and interrater reliability of the NPI-D were both adequate. Overall, caregiver NPI-D distress ratings were correlated significantly with the RSS' (r = .60, P < .001). RSS' ratings correlated strongly with NPI scores (r = .64, P < .001), even after controlling for degree of cognitive impairment based on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score (r = .61). MMSE scores showed a moderate correlation to RSS' ratings (-.30, P = .02), but this association was markedly attenuated when controlling for the degree of neuropsychiatric disturbance based on the NPI score (r = -. 14). NPI-D ratings for 9 of 10 NPI symptom domains correlated most strongly with either NPI symptom severity or total (frequency x severity) scores. Agitation, dysphoria, irritability, delusions, and apathy were the symptoms most often reported to be severely distressing to caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: The NPI-D provides a reliable and valid measure of subjective caregiver distress in relation to neuropsychiatric symptoms measured by the NPI. Neuropsychiatric alterations are more strongly associated than cognitive symptoms to caregiver distress. The NPI-D may be useful in both clinical and research settings for assessing the contribution to caregiver distress of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD patients.

T1  - Diagnosis and treatment of depression in patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias
LA  - eng
SN  - 0160-6689
Y1  - 1998
AB  - Depressive disorders--both major depression and other less severe but nonetheless clinically significant depressions--are common comorbidities, components, or complications of dementia. Depression with reversible cognitive impairment may be a prodrome for dementia rather than a separate and distinct disorder. Recent research has demonstrated that both the diagnosis of major depression and the assessment of typical depressive symptoms can be conducted reliably, even in patients with mild-to-moderate levels of cognitive impairment. Self-ratings of depressive symptoms with the Geriatric Depression Scale remain valid in patients with Mini-Mental State Examination scores of at least 15. Among interviewer-administered instruments, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Cornell Scale are the best established. Potential difficulties with assessment include problems with ascertainment (because families, in general, report greater depression in patients than do clinicians) and the ambiguity of symptoms (because apathy and related symptoms can result from both depression and Alzheimer's disease). Brain changes due to Alzheimer's disease may lead to fundamental differences in drug responses. Nevertheless, randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that depression in dementia responds to specific psychopharmacologic or psychosocial treatments.

T1  - Validity of specific subscales of the positive and negative symptom scales in older schizophrenia outpatients
LA  - eng
SN  - 0920-9964
Y1  - 1997/10/30
AB  - We investigated the construct validity of subscales of the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) along with other measures of psychopathology in 109 schizophrenia outpatients aged 45-84 years. Scores on subscales of the SAPS, SANS and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) were subjected to a principal components analysis and orthogonal rotation followed by an extension analysis. In both analyses, three of four SAPS subscales had their highest loading on the positive symptom factor and four of five SANS subscales had their highest factor loading on the negative symptom factor. The SAPS bizarre behavior subscale, however, had a much higher loading on the depressive symptom factor than on the positive symptom factor, and the SANS avolition-apathy subscale had moderate loadings on both the negative symptom factor and the depressive symptom factor. The use of SAPS and SANS subscales to represent two constructs was largely (but not entirely) validated among middle-aged and elderly schizophrenia outpatients. The SAPS bizarre behavior subscale and, to a lesser extent, the SANS avolition-apathy subscale appear to represent in this older population a separate construct which may be related to depressive symptoms.

T1  - "Are you depressed?" Screening for depression in the terminally ill
LA  - eng
SN  - 0002-953X
Y1  - 1997/05/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the performance of four brief screening measures for depression in a group of terminally ill patients. The methods included 1) a single-item interview assessing depressed mood, 2) a two-item interview assessing depressed mood and loss of interest in activities, 3) a visual analog scale for depressed mood, and 4) the Beck Depression Inventory-Short Form. METHOD: Semistructured diagnostic interviews for depression were administered to 197 patients receiving palliative care for advanced cancer. The interview diagnoses served as the standards against which the screening performance of the four brief screening methods was assessed. RESULTS: Single-item interview screening correctly identified the eventual diagnostic outcome of every patient, substantially outperforming the questionnaire and visual analog measures. CONCLUSIONS: Brief screening measures for depression are important clinical tools for terminally ill patients. For diagnostic purposes, however, they do not approach the validity of a single-item interview that asks, in effect, "Are you depressed?"

T1  - Japanese version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory--a scoring system for neuropsychiatric disturbance in dementia patients
LA  - jpn
SN  - 0006-8969
Y1  - 1997/03/
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neuropsychiatric disturbances are common and burdensome symptoms of dementias. Assessment and measurement of neuropsychiatric disturbances are indispensable to the management of patients with dementia and for clinical research. No standardized instruments have been developed for these purposes in Japan. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), developed by Cummings et al., is a standardized, validated, and reliable tool to assess a wide range of neuropsychiatric derangements in patients with dementia, and has been used in clinical studies in North America. In this study, we prepared a Japanese version of the NPI and tested its reliability and usefulness in dementia patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The subjects were 174 patients with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (140), frontotemporal dementia (12), vascular dementia (19), and normal pressure hydrocephalus (3), whose diagnosis was made on the basis of the results of extensive examinations including MRI and PET/SPECT of the brain and appropriate clinical diagnostic criteria for each disorder. The subjects consisted of 133 women and 41 men; their mean age was 72.6 +/- 7.7 years (S.D.; range: 49 to 88) years. An examiner (neurologist) used the NPI to interview a caregiver familiar with the patient's everyday behavior. In 24 randomly selected patients interview was repeated by another examiner (psychiatrist) one month later, and test-retest reliability was evaluated. The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) were used to assess the severity of the dementia and cognitive impairment. RESULTS: The MMSE scores ranged from 5 to 29 (mean +/- SD = 19.0 +/- 4.8) and the ADAS scores ranged from 7 to 63 (24.3 +/- 10.9). The CDR score was 0.5 in 17 patients, 1 in 95 patients, 2 in 52 patients, and 3 in 10 patient. Test-retest reliability of each score was acceptably high, and the correlation coefficient for each score obtained by repeated assessments in this study was similar to the coefficient in the original report. Apathy was the most common behavior in the ten abnormal behavioral domains, and euphoria was the least common. The prevalence of abnormal findings was also comparable to the results in the original report. The total NPI scores and many of the NPI subscale scores were significantly correlated with both the severity of dementia and cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: This Japanese version of NPI, whose reliability and competency are comparable to those of the original version, is a reliable and useful tool for measuring neuropsychiatric disturbances in dementia patients.

T1  - Frontal behavioral inventory: diagnostic criteria for frontal lobe dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 0317-1671
Y1  - 1997/02/
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To utilize the diagnostic criteria of frontal lobe dementia (FLD). METHODS: We studied 12 patients with FLD diagnosed clinically, with radiological confirmation in 10 and autopsy confirmation in 2; sixteen patients with Alzheimer's disease matched for stage and severity to FLD and 11 patients with depressive dementia were used as control groups. A 24-item Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) using the most relevant behavioral manifestations of FLD was administered in these populations. RESULTS: FLD patient scores on the FBI were much higher compared with control groups (AD and DD). Item analysis showed loss of insight, indifference, distractibility, personal neglect and apathy as the most frequent negative symptoms. Perseveration, disinhibition, inappropriateness, impulsivity, and irresponsibility were the most significant positive symptoms. An operational definition of FLD included a minimum FBI score of 27. Only one false positive was shown in the depressive group and none among the AD group, indicating little overlap between patient groups, and a high discriminating value of the FBI. CONCLUSIONS: The FBI appears to be a useful diagnostic instrument and a method to operate the behavioral criteria of FLD. Further prospective studies are warranted to establish validity.

T1  - Vegetative and psychological symptoms associated with depressed mood over the first two years after stroke
LA  - eng
SN  - 0091-2174
Y1  - 1997
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In patients with acute physical illness, symptoms used in the diagnosis of major depression such as sleep or appetite disturbance may be nonspecific for depression. This study was undertaken to examine the association of depressed mood with other depressive symptoms to determine which symptoms were most useful in the accurate diagnosis of major depression after stroke. METHODS: Using a structured mental status examination, 142 patients with acute stroke were followed at three, six, twelve, and twenty-four months. RESULTS: The median number of vegetative and psychological symptoms among patients with depressed mood was more than three times the respective rates among nondepressed patients at all time points over two years. Autonomic anxiety, morning depression, subjective anergia, worrying, brooding, loss of interest, hopelessness, and lack of self-confidence were significantly more frequent among depressed patients than nondepressed patients throughout the entire two-year period. Some symptoms such as anxious foreboding and loss of libido, as well as self-depreciation, feelings of guilt, and irritability were no longer significantly more common among depressed compared with nondepressed patients after six months. Standard DSM-IV diagnostic criteria and modified DSM-IV diagnostic criteria which included only specific symptoms of depression (i.e., symptoms which were significantly more frequent among depressed than nondepressed mood patients) yielded similar frequencies of major depression diagnosis. There were only a few patients (i.e., 2% to 3%) with depressive symptoms without a depressed mood (perhaps "masked" depression). CONCLUSIONS: Vegetative and psychological depressive symptoms are significantly more common in depressed patients over the first two years after stroke and DSM-IV criteria do not overdiagnose major depression even in this population with chronic physical illness. The symptoms which characterize major depression appear to change between the subacute and chronic post-stroke periods.

T1  - Reliability of the Japanese version of the Inventory to Diagnose Depression
LA  - eng

Y1  - 1996/10/
AB  - The reliability of the Japanese version of the Inventory to Diagnose Depression (IDD) which is a self-report to diagnose major depressive disorders (MDD) of DSM-III-R, was investigated in 30 cases with MDD and 30 control subjects. On test-retest reliability, the agreement of diagnostic performance was substantial (kappa = 0.64, P < 0.001) for 60 subjects, and scores of total and individual items correlated significantly (P < 0.001) between test and retest except for decreased energy, decreased interest, and decreased concentration. The average score of the total IDD severity at test (38.4) was significantly higher than that at retest (28.0; P < 0.01). However, excluding the recovered 10 cases, there was no significant difference seen on the average total score between test and retest (38.8, 30.1, respectively). Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.80) and split-half reliability (0.79) were sufficient, and item-total correlations of the IDD were significant (P < 0.01) except for weight gain. The IDD might be useful as a screening tool and for clinical evaluation of subjects in Japan; however, it is necessary to examine the validity of this instrument.

T1  - Fibromyalgia outcome: the predictive values of symptom duration, physical activity, disability pension, and critical life events--a 4.5 year prospective study
LA  - eng
SN  - 0022-3999
Y1  - 1996/09/
AB  - Forty-four fibromyalgia patients were followed through 4.5 years to assess the extent to which symptom duration, physical activity level, disability pensions, and the occurrence of critical life events would predict long-term outcome. Outcome measures included pressure tenderness (dolorimeter score), work capacity (ergometer cycle test), global subjective improvement (verbal rating scale), and visual analogue scale ratings of pain, disturbed sleep, lack of energy, and depression. Significant outcome predictors were identified by means of separate multiple regression analyses on each outcome measure at follow-up, using symptom duration, physical activity level, disability pension status, and occurrence of critical life events as independent variables, together with baseline symptom intensity and age, which were adjusted for. An adequate physical activity level and increasing age predicted a positive outcome, while receiving a permanent disability pension or having experienced an excess of major negative life events predicted a negative outcome. Symptom duration did not affect outcome.

T1  - The ABCs of managing hyperthyroidism in the older patient
LA  - eng
SN  - 0016-867X
Y1  - 1996/05/
AB  - Hyperthyroidism in the older patient often presents with nonspecific symptoms, such as apathy, weight loss, and atrial fibrillation. General screening is not cost-effective, with the exception of two populations: women over age 40 with one or more nonspecific complaints and patients being admitted to a specialized geriatric unit. The sensitive TSH test is an excellent screen; a low TSH should be confirmed by an actual or estimated high free thyroxine test (FT4). The RAIU can help narrow the differential diagnosis. Radioiodine is the preferred treatment for the older patient with Graves' disease, the most common form of thyrotoxicosis. Graves' must be differentiated from thyroiditis and toxic nodular goiters, as treatment regimens differ for each disorder.

T1  - Effect of continuation treatment on residual symptoms in late-life depression: how well is "well"?
LA  - eng
SN  - 1091-4269
Y1  - 1996
AB  - The objectives of this report were (1) to describe residual depressive symptoms in elderly patients during continuation therapy with combined nortriptyline and interpersonal psychotherapy; (2) to determine which symptoms were persistent; (3) to determine the clinical correlates of residual depressive symptoms; and (4) to document distinct response pattern clusters during combined continuation therapy. METHOD: Box plot analyses of Hamilton depression scores and Global Assessment Scale scores, repeated twice monthly over 4 months, were conducted using data from 105 elderly depressives. Temporal trends in the data were examined via random regression analysis. Individual trajectories for each of the 105 patients were examined for patterns of response during continuation therapy. RESULTS: We observed a low mean Hamilton rating of 7 (SD = 2.3) at the start of continuation therapy and 5 (SD = 3.0) at the end. Both Hamilton and GAS scores showed modest but significant improvement over time. Hamilton variability was most apparent in symptoms of mood lowering, apathy, anxiety (psychological and somatic), feelings of guilt, anergia, insomnia, and loss of libido; other symptoms (retardation, agitation, hypochondriasis, loss of appetite, loss of weight, suicidal ideation, and loss of insight) showed clear resolution. A diagnosis of RDC situational depression was associated with higher levels of residual symptoms, while level of chronic medical burden, personality dysfunction, and social support were not. Examination of response patterns showed that a quarter of patients experienced one or more brief symptomatic exacerbations. CONCLUSION: On average, an excellent level of symptom resolution was achieved for most patients with Hamilton scores comparable to those seen in healthy elderly controls. These data support a position of therapeutic optimism in late-life depression and underscore full remission as an achievable therapeutic goal.

T1  - Application of the multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI-20) in cancer patients receiving radiotherapy
LA  - eng
SN  - 0007-0920
SN  - 1532-1827
Y1  - 1996/01/
AB  - In this paper the psychometric properties of the multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI-20) are established further in cancer patients. The MFI is a 20-item self-report instrument designed to measure fatigue. It covers the following dimensions: general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced activity, reduced motivation and mental fatigue. The instrument was used in a Dutch and Scottish sample of cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. The dimensional structure was assessed using confirmatory factor analyses (Lisrel's unweighted least-squares method). The hypothesised five-factor model appeared to fit the data in both samples (adjusted goodness of fit; AGFI: 0.97 and 0.98). Internal consistency of the separate scales was good in both the Dutch and Scottish samples with Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.93. Construct validity was assessed by correlating the MFI-20 to activities of daily living, anxiety and depression. Significant relations were assumed. Convergent validity was investigated by correlating the MFI scales with a visual analogue scale measuring fatigue and with a fatigue-scale derived from the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist. Results support the validity of the MFI-20. The highly similar results in the Dutch and Scottish sample suggest that the portrayal of fatigue using the MFI-20 is quite robust.

T1  - What things are important in people's lives? A survey of the public's judgements to inform scales of health related quality of life
LA  - eng
SN  - 0277-9536
Y1  - 1995/11/
AB  - The research presented here aimed to obtain population norms on pertinent domains of quality of life and health related quality of life, and the relative importance of these domains to people. The OPCS Omnibus Survey was used as the vehicle for the study. This is a monthly survey of a random sample of 2000 adult members of the population in Great Britain, based on a random sample of households. The data was collected for a one month period. The response rate to the survey was 77%. In response to a generic question about the five (priority ordered) most important things in their lives (good or bad), respondents were most likely to freely mention as the first most important thing in their lives relationships with family or relatives, followed by their own health, the health of another (close) person and finances/standard of living/housing. When responses relating to respondents' priority ranked areas 1-5 were combined, the most frequently mentioned area of life was finances/standard of living/housing, followed by relationships with family and friends, own health, the health of close others and social life/leisure activities. Thus, different distributions were obtained depending on whether priority ordering or frequency with which item was mentioned was analysed. Of those who reported a longstanding illness, the conditions which were most likely to be reported as affecting their lives were respiratory conditions, joint disorders and heart and circulatory diseases. The most commonly freely mentioned first most important effects of the longstanding illness on their lives were (in order of frequency) ability to get out and about/stand/walk/go out shopping, being able to work/find a job and effects on social life/leisure activities (based on office coding from verbatim responses recorded on the questionnaire). When the responses relating to respondents' priority ranks 1-5 were combined, the most frequently mentioned area of life affected was ability to get out and about/stand/walk/go out shopping, followed by social life/leisure activities, and availability of work/ability to work. Again, differences in distributions were obtained depending on the method of analysis. Further investigations also revealed differences according to the method of questioning and coding (respondent vs office). When respondents selected their own codes from a showcard in relation to health effects, there were some discrepancies with their (office coded) verbatim replies (which were recorded by the interviewer before they saw the showcard, for later office coding). The showcard had the effect of prompting them, and the then most commonly mentioned first most important effects of the longstanding illness on their lives were (in order of frequency) pain, tiredness/lack of energy/lethargy, social life/leisure activities, and availability of work/ability to work. This discrepancy illustrates the biasing influence of using showcards, in comparison with the open coding of actual verbatim responses back in the office (on the assumption that the latter are more valid-unprompted-responses). Analysis of the domains included in the most popularly used health status scales, which are used to measure health related quality of life, revealed that several items ranked as important by the public were missing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to develop a standardized instrument, the Behavior Rating Scale for Dementia, for rating psychopathology in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and to conduct a multicenter pilot study of this instrument. METHOD: The rating scale was developed collaboratively on the basis of clinical experience and existing instruments. Items were scaled according to frequency of psychopathology and were administered to an informant who was familiar with the subject. The scale was administered in a standardized manner by trained examiners who had met predetermined certification standards. The study group consisted of 303 subjects with probable Alzheimer's disease who had undergone standardized clinical evaluations by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease. RESULTS: Subjects had an average of 15 problems rated as present in the preceding month. Wide variability in the nature of disturbances was found, with a number of items rated as present since the illness began but not in the past month. Interrater agreement was high. Factor analysis suggested eight preliminary factors that mapped onto clinically relevant domains: depressive features, psychotic features, defective self-regulation, irritability/agitation, vegetative features, apathy, aggression, and affective lability. CONCLUSIONS: The Behavior Rating Scale for Dementia provides a standardized, reliable measure that can be administered to caregivers of demented subjects. On the basis of the present study, the scale has been revised slightly. After additional studies in progress, the Behavior Rating Scale for Dementia will be available for general use in assessing a wide range of psychopathology in dementia.

Y1  - 1995/09/
AB  - Sixty-seven schizophrenic chronic outpatients (DSM-III-R criteria) were examined to study the relationship between symptoms through intercorrelational and factor analysis. Three factors were identified and associated with clusters of symptoms: factor 1 (affective flattening, alogia, avolition-apathy and anhedonia-asociality), factor 2 (formal thought disorder and bizarre behaviour) and factor 3 (hallucinations and delusions). Strong associations between factor 1 and high functional impairment were found. In this population, the segregation of the symptoms could fit into a three-syndrome model, these results agree with findings obtained from samples in which acute symptoms predominated.

T1  - Clinical assessment of mental decline in elderly people: a proposal for a new quantitative index
LA  - eng
SN  - 0394-9532
Y1  - 1995/02/
AB  - Despite the many instruments available for assessing elderly people, there is a need for additional methods to measure mental decline that would also be applicable in cross sectional and longitudinal studies. With this purpose in mind, our group developed and checked a new instrument, the Index of Mental Decline (IMD), which consists of five clusters of items intended for the assessment of cognition, personal interrelationships, affective disorders, apathy and somatic complaints. To improve its consistency, all clusters and items were evaluated individually, according to their clinical impact. Three levels of symptom importance were determined: absent to very mild, mild to moderate, severe to very severe. Inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability were demonstrated in a sample of 59 subjects, and proved to be satisfactory. The validity of the IMD was tested in a group of 203 patients, in whom a clinical diagnosis of probable dementia (DSM III-R criteria) had been formulated. The results suggest the effectiveness of the IMD both in quantifying mental decline and monitoring clinical symptoms. The IMD cannot be the first step of diagnostic procedure, but it can be useful for evaluating mental decline in elderly subjects with cognitive disorders. In longitudinal studies, the presence of the same caregiver or informant is compulsory.

T1  - Perceptual and enactment measurement of self-care
LA  - eng
SN  - 1080-4293
Y1  - 1995///Winter
AB  - The concept of self-care was conceptualized as having three major components: enabling perceptual elements (motivation, values, responsibility, and decision making); domains for enactment (cognitive/ perceptual, psychosocial/affective, and physical functioning); and self-care enactment factors (capacity), which included self-care action and knowledge adequate for self-care. A new tool, The Self-Care Agency Inventory, was designed to discriminate between those who will enact self-care and those who will not because of either a lack of knowledge or a lack of motivation. Content validity was demonstrated (.77 or greater from each scale) and concurrent validity documented. Alpha reliability for the new scale and principal components factor analysis of the scale items did not achieve desired levels, although a pilot sample demonstrated test-retest reliability of .82. The conceptual model is presented.

T1  - Suicidal behavior of depressed patients at inpatient admission
TT  - Suizidalität depressiver Patienten bei stationärer Aufnahme
LA  - ger
SN  - 0028-2804
Y1  - 1995/01/
AB  - Early recognition of suicidal behavior is of extreme importance for avoidance of this cause of death. The risk of suicide attempts is particularly high in psychiatric illness, and among hospital in-patients especially in those with depression. Thus, the risk of suicide should be estimated in the first interview after admission to a psychiatric hospital. Our study analysed the routine documentation of such interviews on admission to the Psychiatrische Klinik der Freien Universität in Berlin: 41% of all depressive patients were suicidal. Suicidal and non-suicidal depressive patients could be differentiated by the following traits: suicidal patients were younger, had been younger at the initial onset of depressive illness, had made more suicide attempts in the past, and had a greater number of relatives who had committed suicide or made suicide attempts. They were more often single or divorced, and had fewer children of their own. Their psychopathology was characterized by a more strongly developed syndrome of depression, hostility and apathy. These findings point to a pattern of characteristics that are linked with suicidal behavior, which can be used to estimate the risk of suicide right at the beginning of a stay in hospital.

Y1  - 1995
AB  - To test underlying latent syndromes within schizophrenic syndromes assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), a sample of 100 DSM-III-R schizophrenia patients was obtained through a semistructured interview for schizophrenia. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the underlying symptomatological dimensions. The positive and negative construct was not confirmed by this study. The three- and four-dimension models obtained higher goodness of fit than the one- or two-dimension models. Models composed of three or four dimensions shared positive and negative syndromes, in addition to "disorder of relating" and/or "disorganization" dimensions. The disorder of relating dimension of PANSS was composed of emotional withdrawal and passive/apathetic social withdrawal. The disorganization dimension comprised two symptoms of PANSS (conceptual disorganization and poor attention) and an item not included in the PANSS: inappropriate affect. It is suggested that a schedule for the assessment of this item be added to the PANSS.

T1  - The Neuropsychiatric Inventory: comprehensive assessment of psychopathology in dementia
LA  - eng
SN  - 0028-3878
Y1  - 1994/12/
AB  - We developed a new instrument, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), to assess 10 behavioral disturbances occurring in dementia patients: delusions, hallucinations, dysphoria, anxiety, agitation/aggression, euphoria, disinhibition, irritability/lability, apathy, and aberrant motor activity. The NPI uses a screening strategy to minimize administration time, examining and scoring only those behavioral domains with positive responses to screening questions. Both the frequency and the severity of each behavior are determined. Information for the NPI is obtained from a caregiver familiar with the patient's behavior. Studies reported here demonstrate the content and concurrent validity as well as between-rater, test-retest, and internal consistency reliability; the instrument is both valid and reliable. The NPI has the advantages of evaluating a wider range of psychopathology than existing instruments, soliciting information that may distinguish among different etiologies of dementia, differentiating between severity and frequency of behavioral changes, and minimizing administration time.

T1  - Symptom prevalence, characteristics and distress in a cancer population
LA  - eng
SN  - 0962-9343
Y1  - 1994/06/
AB  - Despite the importance of symptom control in the cancer population, few studies have systematically assessed the prevalence and characteristics of symptoms or the interactions between various symptom characteristics and other factors related to quality of life (QOL). As part of a validation study of a new symptom assessment instrument, inpatients and outpatients with prostate, colon, breast or ovarian cancer were evaluated using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale and other measures of psychological condition, performance status, symptom distress and overall quality of life. The mean age of the 243 evaluable patients was 55.5 years (range 23-86 years); over 60% were women and almost two-thirds had metastatic disease. The Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score was < or = 80 in 49.8% and 123 were inpatients at the time of assessment. Across tumour types, 40-80% experienced lack of energy, pain, feeling drowsy, dry mouth, insomnia, or symptoms indicative of psychological distress. Although symptom characteristics were variable, the proportion of patients who described a symptom as relatively intense or frequent always exceeded the proportion who reported it as highly distressing. The mean (+/- SD range) number of symptoms per patient was 11.5 +/- 6.0 (0-25); inpatients had more symptoms than outpatients (13.5 +/- 5.4 vs. 9.7 +/- 6.0, p < 0.002) and those with KPS < or = 80 had more symptoms than those with KPS > 80 (14.8 +/- 5.5 vs. 9.2 +/- 4.9, p < 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

T1  - Group differences in the relationship between apathy and depression
LA  - eng
SN  - 0022-3018
Y1  - 1994/04/
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the discriminability of apathy and depression by determining whether the relationship of these two dimensions of behavior varies in different diagnostic groups. Using the authors' Apathy Evaluation Scale and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, we rated 123 subjects, mean age 72 years, who met research criteria for healthy elderly controls, left or right hemisphere stroke, probable Alzheimer's disease, and major depression. Elevated apathy scores unassociated with elevated depression were most frequent in Alzheimer's disease and right hemisphere stroke, and also occurred in a small number of left hemisphere stroke and normal subjects. In major depression, apathy was associated with high depression scores, although a substantial number of major depressives showed elevated depression without elevated apathy. In left hemisphere stroke, probable Alzheimer's disease, and major depression, there were significant positive correlations between apathy and depression. The slope of the regression of apathy on depression was greatest in probable Alzheimer's disease and major depression. These results indicate that the relationship between apathy and depression differs across diagnostic groups and, thus, support the discriminability of apathy and depression.

T1  - The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale: an instrument for the evaluation of symptom prevalence, characteristics and distress
LA  - eng
SN  - 0959-8049
Y1  - 1994
AB  - The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) is a new patient-rated instrument that was developed to provide multidimensional information about a diverse group of common symptoms. This study evaluated the reliability and validity of the MSAS in the cancer population. Randomly selected inpatients and outpatients (n = 246) with prostate, colon, breast or ovarian cancer were assessed using the MSAS and a battery of measures that independently evaluate phenomena related to quality of life. Symptom prevalence in the 218 evaluable patients ranged from 73.9% for lack of energy to 10.6% for difficulty swallowing. Based on a content analysis, three symptoms were deleted and two were added; the revised scale evaluates 32 physical and psychological symptoms. A factor analysis of variance yielded two factors that distinguished three major symptom groups and several subgroups. The major groups comprised psychological symptoms (PSYCH), high prevalence physical symptoms (PHYS H), and low prevalence physical symptoms (PHYS L). Internal consistency was high in the PHYS H and PSYCH groups (Cronback alpha coefficients of 0.88 and 0.83, respectively), and moderate in the PHYS L group (alpha = 0.58). Although the severity, frequency and distress dimensions were highly intercorrelated, canonical correlations and other analyses demonstrated that multidimensional assessment (frequency and distress) augments information about the impact of symptoms. High correlations with clinical status and quality of life measures support the validity of the MSAS and indicate the utility of several subscale scores, including PSYCH, PHYS, and a brief Global Distress Index. The MSAS is a reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of symptom prevalence, characteristics and distress. It provides a method for comprehensive symptom assessment that may be useful when information about symptoms is desirable, such as clinical trials that incorporate quality of life measures or studies of symptom epidemiology.

T1  - The influence of depression, social activity, and family stress on functional outcome after stroke
LA  - eng
SN  - 0039-2499
Y1  - 1993/10/
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was designed to assess the quality of life after an active poststroke period of rehabilitation and to investigate the possibility of a return to a working environment for those still of working age. METHODS: The study was conducted on 180 consecutive patients affected by stroke who were hospitalized for the first time and discharged at least 1 year before the study. The group consisted of 65% men and 35% women with a mean age 65.29 years (SD, 11.22). The period between the stroke and the interview ranged from 12 to 196 months, with a mean of 37.5 months. The average Rankin score on discharge from the rehabilitation center was 2.718 (moderate handicap). The interview took place at home after consent obtained by telephone. The questionnaire included general and personal information regarding the individuals, their socioeconomic position, and scales for daily activity, depression, social activity, and stress produced in the family. The control group consisted of 167 age-matched subjects. RESULTS: A close correlation was observed in all patients between depression, social activity, and stress caused to relatives. The scores on the individual scales were clearly worse than those for control subjects. The patients received approximately 5 months of rehabilitation after the stroke. Differences emerged between men and women for depression and social activities, with the women scoring worse. In reference to daily life, 70% of prestroke ability was required on average after rehabilitation. The daily activity score at the time of the interview was also strongly influenced by the discharge score. The majority of patients were retired. Of the total, 20.64% returned to work, but not always to the same job and often after readapting to new conditions. Of this population, only 31.5% were women. With regard to the population aged younger than 65 years, 21.42% returned to work. Lesions in the dominant hemisphere do not necessarily seem to rule out return to work, even if associated with aphasia. The main discriminating element was the ability to understand language. The patients were often criticized by their cohabitants; the criticisms most often raised concerned apathy, irritability, and self-centeredness. Sexual activity was depressed in almost all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the progress made in studying cerebral vasculopathies, patients in the aftermath of a stroke still seem to live unsatisfactorily, as they did many years ago. Useful measures include valid treatment against spasticity, psychological assistance, and greater social support.

T1  - Nonparticipation in mammography screening: apathy, anxiety or cost?
LA  - eng
SN  - 0028-8446
Y1  - 1993/07/14
AB  - AIMS: A survey was undertaken to find out why only 46% of eligible women had taken the opportunity to join the South Canterbury mammography screening programme in the first 22 months of operation. METHODS: One hundred and sixty seven randomly chosen women, aged between 40 and 65 years, who had not had a mammogram, were questioned about their knowledge of, and attitudes to, mammography screening. RESULTS: The answers showed that apathy, lack of concern and lack of perceived need were reasons quoted for nonattendance by almost half of respondents. Other important barriers to mammography screening were: (1) fear of a positive screen result (admitted by 39%); (2) lack of encouragement by some general practitioners (quoted by 19%); and (3) lack of knowledge about screening mammography (one third did not know that mammography was a screening and not just a diagnostic procedure). The current cost is a major deterrent for many unscreened women with only 28% saying they would be willing to pay more than $55.00, but only 10% unwilling to pay at all and only 5% quoting cost as their reason for nonattendance. CONCLUSION: Strategies to improve attendance are suggested.

Y1  - 1993/06/
AB  - Apathy and depression are discriminable but related dimensions of behavior. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the source of the overlap between measures of apathy and depression. We evaluated the intercorrelations between the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HamD) in 107 subjects, aged 53-85, who met research criteria for normal aging, left or right cerebral hemisphere stroke, probable Alzheimer's disease, or major depression. We determined the correlation between the individual items on the HamD and the total scores on the AES and the HamD. The HamD items having the strongest correlations with AES total score were diminished work/interest, psychomotor retardation, anergy, and lack of insight. The correlation between AES and HamD total scores was nonsignificant when major depression subjects and these variables most closely related to apathy were excluded from consideration. These findings indicate that the convergence between HamD and AES is attributable to (i) a subset of HamD items which are consistent with the syndrome of apathy and (ii) the fact that major depression is associated with both apathy and depression. Clinical and research applications of these results are discussed.

T1  - Emotional distress and fatigue in coronary heart disease: the Global Mood Scale (GMS)
LA  - eng
SN  - 0033-2917
Y1  - 1993/02/
AB  - Evidence indicates that emotional distress has a long-term impact on morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), and that symptoms of depression, fatigue, and reduced energy may identify high-risk patients. This study was designed to: (1) devise a sound and practical measure of emotional distress in CHD patients; (2) examine the relationship between emotional distress and fatigue following CHD; and (3) examine changes in emotional distress as a function of cardiac rehabilitation. A sample of 478 men with CHD (mean age = 57.8 +/- 8.7 y) filled out questionnaires 3-6 weeks following a myocardial infarction (N = 110), bypass surgery (N = 302), or coronary angioplasty (N = 66). Statistical analyses of 56 Dutch mood terms were used to produce the 20-item Global Mood Scale (GMS) which measures negative affect (characterized by fatigue and malaise), as well as positive affect (characterized by energy and sociability), in patients with CHD. The GMS was found to be a reliable scale (alpha > 0.90; r > 0.55 over a 3-month period), and correlations with existing measures of emotional functioning and self-deception indicated its convergent and discriminant validity. Most importantly, fatigue was not related to cardiorespiratory fitness in a subset of 140 patients, but clearly was associated with negative affect. Consistent with the self-efficacy model, scores on the GMS mood scales improved significantly as a function of rehabilitation (P < 0.0001). Although symptoms of emotional distress are easily explained away by situational factors, previous research suggests that failure to recognize the clinical significance of these symptoms in CHD patients may result in the delay of much needed intervention. The current findings suggest that the GMS is a theoretically and psychometrically sound measure of emotional distress in CHD patients, and that this scale is sufficiently sensitive to assess change.

T1  - A methodology for collecting outcome measures for common hospital conditions
LA  - eng
SN  - 0957-4832
Y1  - 1992/12/
AB  - An eight-month prospective analysis of routinely collected hospital data with 24-week follow-up of mortality and morbidity was carried out at two district general hospitals in Somerset Health District, to test the feasibility of collecting useful and valid outcome measures for two common hospital conditions, strokes and fractured hips. Data were collected on 163 consecutive admissions with a primary diagnosis of stroke (83 cases) or fractured hip (80 cases). At 24 weeks, 38 patients with stroke had died (mortality ratio 46 per cent, 95 per cent C.I. = 35.3-56.7 per cent) and 11 with fractured hip had died (mortality ratio 14 per cent, 95 per cent C.I. = 6.4-21.6 per cent). Seven patients (four with fractured hip and three with stroke) died after 24 weeks and before responding to the NHP questionnaire. One stroke patient could not be traced. Nottingham Health Profiles were received from 106 patients (41 with stroke and 65 with fractured hip). Both groups of patients had problems with physical mobility and lack of energy. Patients with fractured hips were more likely to complain of pain. It is concluded that the methods used to collect outcome measures in this study are widely applicable to other conditions, but the interpretation and comparability of the results require the collection of similar data elsewhere.

T1  - Reliability, validity, and clinical correlates of apathy in Parkinson's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 0895-0172
Y1  - 1992///Spring
AB  - The authors examined a consecutive series of 50 patients for the presence of apathy, depression, anxiety, and neuropsychological deficits using a neuropsychological battery that included a recently designed apathy scale. This scale was found to be reliable and valid in the diagnosis of apathy in patients with PD. Of patients in the study, 12% showed apathy as their primary psychiatric problem, and 30% were both apathetic and depressed. Patients with apathy (with or without depression), showed significantly more deficits in both tasks of verbal memory and time-dependent tasks. Results suggest that apathy is a frequent finding in PD, is significantly associated with specific cognitive impairments, and may have a different mechanism than depression.

T1  - Behavioral syndromes in Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 1041-6102
Y1  - 1992
AB  - The Behavioral Syndromes Scale for Dementia (BSSD) is a new instrument that showed strong internal consistency and interrater reliability in an outpatient sample of 106 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease. Factor analysis provided support for a priori symptom groupings, particularly the syndromes of disinhibition and apathy-indifference. Dependency (87%), denial of illness (63%), and motor agitation (55%) were common, while sexual disinhibition (2.9%) and self-destructive behaviors (2.9%) were rare. Virtually all symptoms were predominantly minimal to mild in severity. Patients with longer illness duration were more apathetic. Disinhibited behaviors and apathy-indifference increased with greater severity of dementia. Catastrophic reactions, aggression, and agitation were associated with greater functional impairment. There was great heterogeneity in symptom presentation. In Alzheimer's disease, several behavioral changes might be direct manifestations of underlying brain pathology, rather than being solely secondary to cognitive impairment.

T1  - Predictors of behavioral disturbance in Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 0022-1422
Y1  - 1991/11/
AB  - The relationship of behavioral disturbances in Alzheimer's disease to disease severity, age at onset, and the presence of extrapyramidal signs was investigated in three studies. Five categories of behavior disturbance were ascertained through structured interview with the patient's primary caregiver: apathy, agitation, psychotic symptoms, disinhibition, and irritability. In Study 1, measures of disease severity accounted for 42% of the variance in the Apathy scale but less than 20% of the variance in the remaining scales. In Study 2, the presence of extrapyramidal signs was associated with increased Apathy and moderated the association between disease severity and the Psychotic Symptoms and Irritability scales. In Study 3, age at onset was associated with the Agitation scale and moderated the association between disease severity and the Apathy, Psychotic Symptoms, and Irritability scales. The findings are discussed in terms of the clinical heterogeneity within Alzheimer's disease, the possible biological bases of these behavioral disturbances, and the psychometric issues pertinent to their measurement.

T1  - Beta-blocker therapy: identification and management of side effects
LA  - eng
SN  - 0147-9563
Y1  - 1991/09/
AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop and test a new beta-Blocker Visual Analog Scale designed to identify and quantify the impact that the side effects of beta-blocker therapy have on people's lives, and the self-management practices people use to mediate their influence. Instruments included the 20-item beta-Blocker Visual Analog Scale and the Profile of Mood States. Subjects had hypertension; 51 men were involved in a larger study involving antihypertensive medications and exercise, and 19 men and women were receiving beta-blocker therapy as first-line drug of choice. Estimates of internal consistency reliability, content validity, and concurrent and discriminant validity were moderately strong. The most problematic side effects were related to lack of sleep, vivid or active dreams, lack of energy and pep, diminished interest in sexual activity, and changes in vision. Among self-management practices used to mediate side effects were planning rest and activity periods, thinking carefully before reacting, and seeking out others for support.

T1  - Reliability and validity of the Apathy Evaluation Scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 0165-1781
Y1  - 1991/08/
AB  - This article presents evidence for the reliability and construct validity of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). Conceptually, apathy is defined as lack of motivation not attributable to diminished level of consciousness, cognitive impairment, or emotional distress. Operationally, the AES treats apathy as a psychological dimension defined by simultaneous deficits in the overt behavioral, cognitive, and emotional concomitants of goal-directed behavior. Three versions of the AES (clinician, informant, and self-rated) were evaluated for 123 subjects, ages 53-85, meeting research criteria for right or left hemisphere stroke, probable Alzheimer's disease, major depression, or well elderly control. Multiple forms of reliability (internal consistency, test-retest, and interrater) were satisfactory. Several types of validity evidence are presented for each version of the scale, including the following: ability of the AES to discriminate between groups according to mean levels of apathy, discriminability of apathy ratings from standard measures of depression and anxiety, convergent validity between the three versions of the scale, and predictive validity measures derived from observing subjects' play with novelty toys and videogames. Guidelines for the administration of the AES are presented, along with suggestions for potential applications of the scale to clinical and research questions.

T1  - Proposed factor structure of the Geriatric Depression Scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 1041-6102
Y1  - 1991///Spring
AB  - The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is commonly used to measure depression in the elderly. However, there have been no reports of the underlying structure of the GDS. To this end, the GDS was administered to 326 community-dwelling elderly subjects, and the data were subjected to a factor analysis. A five-factor solution was selected and, after a varimax rotation, the factors that emerged could be described as: (1) sad mood, (2) lack of energy, (3) positive mood, (4) agitation, and (5) social withdrawal. This solution accounted for 42.9% of the variance. Knowledge of the factor structure should aid both clinicians and researchers in the interpretation of responses on the GDS.

T1  - Mood disorders in the year after first stroke
LA  - eng
SN  - 0007-1250
Y1  - 1991/01/
AB  - An unselected community sample of 128 patients were studied over the 12 months after their first stroke, and compared with a control sample of subjects from the general population. Psychiatric status was assessed using the PSE and BDI. Symptoms of mood disorder were commoner in the stroke patients than the controls, but the differences were not substantial and had largely disappeared by 12 months. Psychiatric problems encountered included agoraphobia, social withdrawal, apathy and self-neglect, irritability and pathological emotionalism. While there was a high cumulative incidence of psychiatric disorder, little of it persisted: only two cases of major depression were present for the whole 12 months. We believe undue emphasis has been placed in the recent literature on major depression as a specific syndrome following stroke.

T1  - Prediction of independent functioning and behavior problems in geriatric patients
LA  - eng
SN  - 0002-8614
Y1  - 1990/12/
AB  - Folstein's Mini Mental State Exam, a test assessing the capacity to perform novel and/or repetitive motor tasks (Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale) and a brief measure of working memory were used in a sample of 50 male Veterans Affairs geriatric clinic patients who ranged in age from 63 to 105 (mean, 80.1). The purpose of this study was to attempt to predict the patients' capacity to regulate their behavior independently. We hypothesized that frontal lobe disorders often impair a patient's ability to function autonomously and that the Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale, a measure of frontal lobe impairment, would best predict the capacity for independent regulation of purposeful behavior. Therefore, we examined the relationship of the Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale with spouses' and caregivers' ratings of patients' independent living skills, and with behaviors that interfere with independent functioning. The results of hierarchial regression analyses indicated that the Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale was the only predictor of functional autonomy and was the best predictor of both impulsivity and apathy among geriatric patients. The Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale appears to assess a different functional domain than do the MMSE and similar measures, which rely heavily on the evaluation of orientation and gross cognitive status.

Y1  - 1990/08/
AB  - As part of the strategic planning for increasing participation by community residents in cancer screening, a survey about life style and attitudes toward cancer screening was carried out in Samukawa town, Kanagawa Prefecture. Subjects were males 40 years old or over, and females 30 years old or over selected by random sampling from residents. Number of subjects was 1,916 (822 males, 1,094 females). Self administered anonymous questionnaires were sent and returned by mail. The response rate was 73%. The results were as follows: (1) The reported participation rates for cancer screening under "the Health and Medical Services Law for the Aged" did not reflect the actual participation rate of residents. (2) The major reason for not participation in screening was lack of interest in cancer prevention. (3) Socio-economic status of regular participants in screening was different from persons who did not participate. (4) Persons who did not participate in screening were more passive with regard to obtaining knowledge of cancer than regular participants. (5) Results of this study show that cancer prevention education at various levels such as by clinical offices, TV and radio programs, and newspapers may be effective. In order to increase participation in screening programs, health education that considers the life style characteristics of persons who do not participate in the screening programs is vitally important.

SN  - 0895-0172
Y1  - 1990///Summer
AB  - Personality alterations were investigated in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), multi-infarct dementia (MID), and normal control subjects, using a standardized informant-rated personality inventory. Personality alterations were observed in all patients, and the two diagnostic groups exhibited many similar behavioral alterations. DAT patients had significantly greater alterations in maturity and exhibited less personal control compared with the MID patients; the latter manifested more apathy and remained more affectionate and easy-going. Few correlations were found between the severity of dementia and the magnitude of behavioral changes. Personality alterations are an important and consistent aspect of the phenomenology of dementing disorders.

T1  - Validity and reliability of the dementia behavior disturbance scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 0002-8614
Y1  - 1990/03/
AB  - Behavioral disturbance is a common and distinctive feature of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Existing instruments designed to quantify behavior disturbance among patients with dementia tend to be quite heterogeneous, including many items that do not refer to behavioral disturbance as such, but rather to cognitive, psychological, or somatic symptoms, or functional impairments. A 28-item Dementia Behavior Disturbance (DBD) scale was developed to avoid some of the problems encountered with the older instruments. In two samples of patients with dementia (n = 50 and n = 46), the most common symptoms were repetitive questions, losing or hiding things, lack of interest in daily activities, nocturnal wakefulness, unwarranted accusations, excessive daytime sleeping, and pacing. The coefficient of internal consistency was greater than .80 in both samples, and the correlation between scores obtained from the same subjects at a two-week interval was moderately high (Pearson's correlation coefficient = .71). There was a relatively high correlation between DBD scores and scores on Greene's Behavior and Mood Disturbance scale, and higher DBD scores were associated with increased duration and severity of disease. These preliminary results indicate that the DBD may be a useful and valid measure of one dimension of the dementia syndrome.

T1  - Measurement and prediction of functional capacity in Alzheimer's disease
LA  - eng
SN  - 0028-3878
Y1  - 1990/01/
AB  - Functional loss in Alzheimer's disease is difficult to measure or predict. The Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (Part 1) correlates well with postmortem changes but is not an effective antemortem index of functional change since disparate behavioral domains are assessed. We performed a factor analysis of the Blessed items in 187 patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and identified 4 independent factors: (I) cognitive, (II) personality, (III) apathy, and (IV) basic self-care. An endpoint, consisting of a score indicative of moderate disability, was determined for each factor. We then used life table analyses to compare the probability of reaching these endpoints over time in longitudinally followed patients. Patients with extrapyramidal signs at their initial visit reached the factor IV endpoint sooner, and those with psychosis or no family history of dementia also reached the factor I endpoint faster. These data illustrate the utility of a multifactorial approach to the assessment of functional capacity in Alzheimer's disease, and also indicate that extrapyramidal symptoms and psychosis are powerful predictors of the rate of decline in basic self-care activities and cognition.

LA  - eng
SN  - 0002-953X
Y1  - 1989/09/
AB  - A structured interview covering the DSM-III criteria for major depression was adapted for separate use with Alzheimer's disease patients and with their families. Data from 36 patients yielded a depression rate of 13.9%, whereas information from their families indicated that the rate was 50.0%. This disagreement reflected greater family endorsement of patients' loss of interest or pleasure, irritability, fatigue, and feelings of worthlessness. Use of DSM-III-R criteria narrowed but did not eliminate the discrepancy between patients' and families' assessments of the patients' depression. Uniform procedures for gathering and integrating data from the family that are relevant to diagnosis in this group are indicated.

T1  - The stressors and the post-traumatic stress syndrome after an industrial disaster
LA  - eng
SN  - 0065-1591
Y1  - 1989
AB  - Acute and subacute post-traumatic stress reactions are reported among 246 employees of an industrial factory which was severely damaged by an explosion and fire. Sixty-six A-subjects had narrow escape experiences (high stress exposure group), while 59 B-subjects were less severely exposed (medium stress exposure group). The 121 C-subjects were not present at work when the explosion occurred (low stress exposure group). A response rate of 97.6% was achieved at the primary examination, and a 100% response at the 7 months follow-up. The frequency and intensity of post-traumatic stress reactions were linked to the severity (A,B,C) of the stress exposure; specific post-traumatic anxiety reactions reported by more than 80% of A-subjects. The reactions appeared immediately or within hours, only 5% of A had delays of a few weeks. While 24.3% of A had State Anxiety Inventory scores 1 week post-disaster higher than 60, 8.5% of B and 2.5% of C had similar scores. Depressive reactions, social withdrawal, guilt, shame and irritability were less frequent, and appeared nearly always concomitant with anxiety symptoms. While the anxiety symptoms made up a tight knit syndrome, the less frequent non-anxiety symptoms were linked to the post-traumatic anxiety syndrome. The subjects' fears reflected the trauma, they feared inanimate objects, and there were hardly any paranoid ideations. The disaster exposure of the A and B but not of the C group members constituted a stressor which fulfilled the PTSD stressor criterion of the DSM III R. A minority of the C group developed a post-traumatic stress syndrome. After 7 months, all 30 post-traumatic stress reactions were more frequent and severe in the A than B group which again differed from the C group. Irritability was the only post-traumatic stress reaction that increased in frequency and intensity during the 7 months observation period. The findings represent evidence that supports the face validity, descriptive and construct validity of the PTSD diagnosis.

LA  - eng
SN  - 0022-1422
Y1  - 1988/09/
AB  - Eighty consecutive attenders (M age = 75 years) in a primary care group practice associated with a teaching hospital in New York were assessed for depression using a self-administered questionnaire, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and a rater-administered interview, the Short-CARE. The sample was 75% female and 85% black or Hispanic. The response rate of completed interviews was 65% for the Zung SDS and 100% for the Short-CARE. Among the reasons indicated by subjects for not filling out the Zung SDS were visual problems (n = 13, 28%), illiteracy (n = 4, 9%), and lack of motivation/wanted it read to them (n = 16, 34%). Additionally, using the Primary Care Physicians' Questionnaire (PCPQ), results from the Short-CARE and the Zung SDS were compared to primary care physicians' judgments regarding the presence of depression in these patients. The convergent validity coefficient for the Zung SDS with the PCPQ was .65 (kappa = .29); the comparable coefficients for the PCPQ and the Short-CARE Depression Scale were .73 and .46 respectively.

T1  - Symptoms of depression in old people in Finland
LA  - eng
SN  - 0044-281X
Y1  - 1988///Sep-Oct
AB  - The study describes common symptoms of depression and age and sex differences in these symptoms in elderly Finns. The symptoms were assessed on the basis of the 22-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), and comparisons were made between the symptoms of those diagnosed as depressed and those diagnosed as not depressed in clinical investigations. The most common symptoms in depressed men were general somatic symptoms, initial insomnia, loss of interest in work and activities, middle insomnia, and depressed mood. In depressed women, the most common symptoms were psychic anxiety, general somatic symptoms, initial insomnia, loss of interest in work and activities, and depressed mood. In both these groups the lowest occurrences were found for compulsory symptoms, paranoid symptoms and depersonalization. The symptomatology was most severe in the oldest age group: depressed mood and many somatic symptoms were more common in depressed older male and female age groups than in younger groups. Sex comparisons showed that many symptoms were more severe in depressed women than in depressed men: depressed mood, feelings of guilt, psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety and diurnal variation of symptoms were more common in depressed women. Retardation was the only symptom that was more common in depressed men. Loss of libido did not belong to the symptomatology of depression in the oldest female age group, but in men and in younger female age group it could in some cases indicate occurrence of depression.

LA  - eng
SN  - 0020-7640
Y1  - 1988///Winter
AB  - The study describes symptoms and signs of depression in elderly (60 years or over) Finns. Lists of symptoms and signs assessed by the examining physicians in a population study were used in rating, and the symptoms and signs of persons diagnosed as depressed were compared to those of persons who were not depressed. The commonest symptoms both in men and women were sleep disturbances, fatiguability, loss of interest, depressed mood, loss of activity, pains, pessimism and sense of uselessness. In addition, worry was a common symptom in women. Hallucinations and other delusions than those about unforgivable behaviour were very uncommon. Loss of libido did not strongly indicate occurrence of depression, and in persons aged 70 years or over it could not be included in symptoms of depression. Sex differences in the commonest symptoms of depression were evident: worry, crying spells, helplessness, loneliness, suicidal ideas and pains were more common in depressed women than in depressed men. Some age differences in symptoms were also found both in men and in women. Sad expression was a common sign of depression in both sexes. In addition, slow movements, scarcity of gestures and slow speech were quite common signs in depressed men and stooping posture was quite common in depressed women.

T1  - Self-reported physical stress reactions: first- and second-order factors
LA  - eng
SN  - 0363-3586
Y1  - 1984/06/
AB  - Stress Inventory-6, a 72-item self-report questionnaire designed to tap 18 factors of physical stress reactions, was subjected to factor analysis. The instrument was given to 474 students (254 females, 206 males, and 14 who failed to indicate their gender). The final factor solution identified 16 first-order and 4 second-order factors. The first-order solution replicated most of the factors identified in a previous study and defined factors in terms of organ system, muscle group, and simple content. In the second-order solution, Factors I, III, and IV include symptoms that are immediate and direct, appear to be related to arousal of the somatic and sympathetic nervous system, and are marked prominently by cardiorespiratory activity. In contrast, Factor II includes symptoms that are indirect and often delayed consequences of sustained arousal (Fatigue and Lack of Energy, Headaches, Backaches, etc.). A major distinction can be made between stress arousal Factors I and III. Factor III appears to be a simple "fight or flight" arousal pattern characterized by fairly direct manifestations of striated muscle tension as well as cardiorespiratory activity. In contrast, Factor I is a complex arousal pattern characterized by diffuse autonomic arousal, self-directed attention, and possibly low self-esteem. The results of this study draw into question the extent to which popular stress inventories tap a representative sample of stress symptoms. Clinical implications are discussed.

T1  - Replicated evidence on the construct validity of the SCAG (Sandoz Clinical Assessment-Geriatric) scale
LA  - eng
SN  - 0278-5846
Y1  - 1984
AB  - Factor analysis procedures, applied to a data bank of 1165 senile patients from 21 double-blind studies, yielded 5 factors: cognitive dysfunction (4 items), interpersonal relationships (4 items), apathy (4 items), affect (3 items) and somatic function (3 items). A retrospective review of the 1165 case histories revealed that patients fell into three distinct diagnostic classes: (a) patients whose symptoms of dementia were likely associated with multiple infarcts; (b) patients with other medical disorders such as metabolic imbalances, pulmonary diseases, etc. which may have induced dementia-like symptoms; and (c) primary degenerative dementia for patients with no evidence of other intervening causes. Factor analysis applied independently to the SCAG data of each of the three groups produced similar factor constructs, thereby suggesting that results reported with this instrument are valid across different geriatric diagnostic categories.

Y1  - 1978/12/
AB  - A major purpose of this study was to compare the projections of 50 young and 50 elderly subjects to the Seniors Apperception Technique. Specifically, the emotional contents of stories told to the test were compared for sex and generational differences. The results showed, in general, that, while the themes contained more negative than positive feelings, many individuals gave unhappy stories happy conclusions. In addition, the projections of elderly and female respondents were more positive than those of younger and male subjects. The findings were interpreted in light of Neugartin's disengagement theory.
